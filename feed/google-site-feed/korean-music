Among the many composers and producers who have worked with the group on the album previously, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/arirang-diplo-confirms-work-on-bts-album-is-his-biggest-work-yet-says-it-will-shock-the-world-1400578">Diplo confirmed his contribution</a>, and now, OneRepublic&rsquo;s Ryan Tedder has chimed in about it being a &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; thing in his own career.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>After Diplo, Ryan Tedder calls the BTS album one of his biggest works done</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the crowd during the group&rsquo;s set for the OneRepublic From Asia, With Love 2026 in Seoul concert, he spoke about how he has two jobs, one in his own group and one back in the studio with many artists. Ryan Tedder then said, &ldquo;Most recently, I did a lot of work on the upcoming BTS album,&rdquo; earning loud cheers from them. Asking attendees whether they wanted to hear more, he said, and started off by building hype around his work with the septet, &quot;Working on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-if-theyll-submit-arirang-for-grammy-rm-reacts-to-k-pop-nods-dont-want-to-be-desperately-1400723">BTS</a>&#39; new album is truly amazing... You&#39;ll probably love it.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to share his praise for the group and their work, &quot;I&rsquo;ll say this. It absolutely blew me away how talented they (BTS) were. Honestly, it&#39;s one of the craziest things I&#39;ve ever worked on in my whole career. Ever. It&rsquo;s crazy. I think I know you&#39;re going to love it. So that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say.&rdquo; He then joked, &quot;I think I&#39;ll get in trouble if I say more, so I&#39;ll stop here.&quot;</p>

<p>The man behind contributions to Grammy-winning albums like Adele&#39;s 21 and 25, and Taylor Swift&#39;s 1989, has dipped his toes in the world of K-pop many times before. From BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa&#39;s ROCKSTAR, TWICE&#39;s CRY FOR ME, TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s Back for More and Do It Like That, and he has even worked on BTS&rsquo; Jimin&#39;s Be Mine. With many hits under his own group, the One Republic star managed to raise the stakes for the upcoming album even further.</p>

<p>BTS will release their 5th full-length album ARIRANG on March 20, 2026.</p>

With a month left to BTS&rsquo; comeback, the singer may aim for losing more, not that there&rsquo;s any need for it. Previously, fellow member V also shared a look at his weight change and how he has been&nbsp;losing the muscles he had gained while training in the army. Recently, Jungkook shared a photo of himself working out on the treadmill late at night.

On February 20 local time, the team&rsquo;s social media account had a post about an important update, which led the fans to learn about the announcement of member Manon Bannerman&rsquo;s temporary hiatus. Soon after, the star assured her fans in a brief update and voiced plans to reunite with them.</p>

<p><strong>Manon steps back from group activities, team to promote as a five-piece temporarily</strong></p>

<p>On Friday, a notice was shared on the group&rsquo;s Weverse account relaying the update for KATYEYE fans. It reads as follows: &ldquo;After open and thoughtful conversations together, we are sharing that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/are-manon-and-the-kid-laroi-dating-katseye-member-wants-people-to-get-a-job-with-savage-reply-1396628">Manon</a> will be taking a temporary hiatus from group activities to focus on her health and wellbeing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing that the agency fully supports this call and will work as normal otherwise, added, &ldquo;KATSEYE remains committed to showing up for one another and for the fans who mean everything to us. The group will continue scheduled activities during this time, and we look forward to being together again when the time is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, the singer herself took to her Weverse DMs with her fans to share a personal health update, &ldquo;Hi friends (white heart emoji). I want you to hear this from me, I&#39;m healthy, I&#39;m okay, and I&#39;m taking care of myself. Thank u for checking in! Sometimes things unfold in ways we don&#39;t fully control, but I&#39;m trusting the bigger picture. Thank you for standing by me. I love you endlessly and can&#39;t wait to see you again.&rdquo;</p>

However, one point of discussion remains how involved BTS member V was in it which Min Hee Jin has previously used to her advantage. Now, a conversation between the K-pop idol and the former CEO has revealed that the Layover singer once shared he found common points as well. However, the star himself has said that the submission of the chat as evidence was not with his consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>V expresses surprise over the use of private chat as &lsquo;evidence&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-how-members-reacted-to-rms-thoughts-of-disband-or-take-hiatus-livestream-itd-be-weird-if-you-1400720">BTS</a> member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-beats-ronaldo-and-messi-to-become-most-searched-celeb-of-2025-named-biggest-k-pop-star-on-list-1400364">V</a> has taken to his Instagram story to personally share his thoughts about a private conversation becoming privy to the world as part of an ongoing legal dispute. He quoted a report that said that the KakaoTalk messages between BTS member V and Min Hee Jin were also accepted as evidence. In the text, following message was written, &lsquo;(There&#39;s always talk of plagiarism, and it&#39;s not once not been mentioned) Huh... that&rsquo;s what. I took a look as well and thought, &lsquo;Oh, this is kinda similar&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of relying on his agency to comment on the issue, V took the matter into his own hands. Taking a stand against the use of his chat without his permission, he wrote on his social media handle, &ldquo;This is part of a private, everyday conversation that I shared with empathy, as they were my acquaintance. I have no intention of taking sides. However, I find it very upsetting (surprised, or embarrassed, or taken aback) that the conversation in question was submitted as evidence without my consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTS is all set to release a new album called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-if-theyll-submit-arirang-for-grammy-rm-reacts-to-k-pop-nods-dont-want-to-be-desperately-1400723">ARIRANG</a> on March 20, 2026, which be followed by a world tour across 81 stops in 34 cities.

So when the announcement for a new album came through, many wondered if the team would be interested in getting nominated once again. Leader RM is unsure of it as of now, but instead appreciates all the charm of the show, including the recent increase in K-pop nominees, including BLACKPINK member Ros&eacute; and KPop Demon Hunters&rsquo; appearance in the Big Four categories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS reacts to possibly submitting ARIRANG to the Grammys</strong></p>

<p>Reflecting on the growing number of K-pop nominees at the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-members-custom-grammy-awards-performance-suits-to-be-exhibited-at-seouls-jewelry-museum-from-sept-to-dec-1323292">Grammy Awards</a>, including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/grammys-2026-blackpinks-rose-makes-history-as-1st-k-pop-soloist-performing-kpop-demon-hunters-golden-locks-debut-win-1400390">Ros&eacute;</a>&rsquo;s two Big Four nods for APT. and KPop Demon Hunters&rsquo; total five, out of which they won one, RM shared with GQ, &ldquo;There are a lot of K-pop-related nominees you see in the general field and, really, I want to send big applause for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sharing that the thought of winning a golden gramophone is still a goal for the team, the captain calls it far-fetched for the group. More than a month before the release of their 5th studio album, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/arirang-diplo-confirms-work-on-bts-album-is-his-biggest-work-yet-says-it-will-shock-the-world-1400578">ARIRANG</a>, leader RM added, &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;ll try. Maybe we&rsquo;ll submit our album to the Grammys again. But I don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t want to be desperately eager for it&hellip;. We don&rsquo;t want to say anymore like, &lsquo;Ah, man, we want the Grammys.&rsquo; I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we really don&rsquo;t want it&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll try. But if not, then okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>BTS nabbed a nomination for Dynamite in 2021 and then for Butter in 2022, and finally three more in 2023 for Yet To Come, My Universe with Coldplay, and Music of the Spheres as a featured artist, but walked away empty-handed all times, infuriating their fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the group seems to be more than accepting of their missed chance with the Recording Academy&rsquo;s awards, and although it is one of the accolades they haven&rsquo;t managed to grab so far, they&rsquo;re not heavily relying on it. &ldquo;Now, the most important thing is just that we are here back together again, we&rsquo;re going to see the fans all over the world,&rdquo; concluded RM.</p>

Ahead of releasing their fifth studio album, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/is-bts-filming-arirang-comeback-music-video-in-lisbon-fans-spot-group-at-dubai-airport-layover-1400436">ARIRANG</a>, the group is sharing their thoughts on being away from the limelight for so long, owing to their military enlistments, and on their return, leader RM spoke up about feeling the pressure from all around the world for a banging comeback. He opened up about considering a hiatus and even disbandment, which surprised millions. Now, fellow bandmates shared with GQ how they took the fun route instead of taking it too seriously.</p>

<p><strong>BTS reveals how they coped with RM&rsquo;s honest live session</strong></p>

<p>Back in December 2025, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-did-rm-say-its-time-to-disband-bts-know-truth-behind-hilarious-livestream-exchange-with-jimin-1398647">RM</a> had spoken about how massive the pressure is for the group. While contemplating whether to go for sleeping pills, while wondering if the team should take a break or break up, after all, the singer managed to shock their millions of fans. However, the other <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-walk-kings-road-during-gwanghwamun-square-comeback-live-heres-what-we-know-1400450">BTS</a> members, the only people who could understand just exactly what was going through the leader&rsquo;s mind, decided to take it in stride. Making fun of the situation, they shared memes of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, none of us watched that video of the live-streaming,&rdquo; V shared, who admitted that being the captain of the ship comes with more pressure for the 31-year-old, with Jin adding that they had only witnessed short-form content versions of the livestream. SUGA added that the members don&rsquo;t often consume each other&rsquo;s chats with their fans, and it&rsquo;d be &lsquo;weird&rsquo; to watch it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always together, and we&rsquo;re like brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clarifying that it was indeed RM&rsquo;s deep honesty with the ARMY and his way of being vulnerable, the team resorted to making fun of him for it instead of calling him out, terming his vulnerability as his love language. Jimin shared that the group isn&rsquo;t the type to console each other, &ldquo;But we just laugh and make fun of the person to make him laugh and forget about it&hellip;.

<p><strong>Diplo speaks up on his &lsquo;biggest&rsquo; music contribution on BTS&rsquo; 5th album ARIRANG</strong></p>

<p>Opening up about the group&rsquo;s upcoming album ARIRANG, the American DJ shared how it would be surprising for everyone witnessing it, &quot;I just feel so lucky because I&#39;ve been working for three decades and to link up with a group like that, and have them trust me and do some awesome music ... honestly, it&#39;s gonna shock the world,&quot; Diplo said on Saturday night.

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1470099793_bts.webp"></img><p>BTS is K-pop royalty, and once again marking their mark in the world of Korean music, the team is seemingly taking a big step for their Gwanghwamun Square show. Reports have surfaced on Wednesday that the septet is expected to walk a route famously taken by Kings in the past and holds great historical significance. As of right now, the rumors only stem from Korean media coverage, with Chosun Ilbo sharing it as a possibility. Official confirmations are awaited from the group&rsquo;s team.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS to walk the royal path to meet fans and shoot content for ARIRANG comeback livestream</strong></p>

<p>As per reports on February 4, BTS is expected to take the historic route from Geungjeongmun to Heungnyemun to Gwanghwamun and the plaza as the opening scene for their performance at the esteemed Gwanghwamun Square, which will be broadcast to millions across the world. The walk is expected to be pre-recorded or partially livestreamed to the BTS ARMY on March 21.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously undertaken by Korean Kings for their meetings and interactions with their subjects, BTS may follow the famed &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Road/King&rsquo;s Path&rsquo; to interact with their fans. It is known that the plaza in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, known as the &quot;wolgae&quot;, was restored in 2023 after being destroyed a century ago. Originally built in 1866, the route would imply the &lsquo;return of the King of K-pop&rsquo; if this becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Just one day prior, it was announced that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-livestream-arirang-comeback-for-global-fans-bts-the-return-documentary-planned-for-march-27-1400416">BTS THE COMEBACK LIVE: ARIRANG</a> live will be streamed on March 21 at 8 pm KST (4:30 pm IST) on Netflix.

The event will be followed by a feature-length documentary called BTS: THE RETURN, which will be released subsequently on March 27 and cover the making of the record.</p>

In a refreshing and welcome change, amid all the stigma around K-pop idols&rsquo; dating lives, she has been upfront about her past experiences and included them in her songwriting. During her latest appearance on Alex Cooper&#39;s Call Her Daddy podcast, she spoke about how in the past, the fear of being caught made her buy older women outfits so she could dress in them before going to her boyfriend&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p><strong>Dating as a K-pop star is tough and this time, Ros&eacute; is laying it bare</strong></p>

<p>Opening up about the many times that she has had to change her appearance in order to fool fans that may be lurking around or even paparazzi keeping a track of her actions, the singer shared with the host how she would keep a big set of disguise clothes at her place. Ros&eacute; shared, &ldquo;I got a wig. A black curly wig, like a short one. And then I studied how older people&mdash;like elderly women&mdash;would dress on the street. I&rsquo;d be like, Okay, they wear that kind of skirt, those shoes, that kind of bag. I would study it, order it, and then dress up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being paranoid about being caught dating, she turned to these methods to keep herself hidden away from the lenses and went &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; with it. On being asked whether she would go to outside dates dressed like that, the 28-year-old revealed that they were stuck at home mostly because she could not be spotted outside, &ldquo;I would go to his house like that, because we couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I traveled that way just in case somebody saw me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eventually her obsession with dressing up came to a point that she had a section of just grandma clothes at her home. She clarified that she had gotten rid of it since. Revealing whether her partner would also dress up or disguise himself, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/katseye-and-blackpinks-rose-earn-first-ever-grammy-nominations-check-out-who-theyre-up-against-1398300">APT.</a> hitmaker shared that her boyfriend would also become more &lsquo;grandpa-ish&rsquo; but did not have to wear a wig unlike herself who even learned how to walk like old people.</p>

On January 24, it was announced that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/enhypen-drops-seductive-digital-single-loose-ahead-of-coachella-set-leaves-fans-heart-racing-1380645">ENHYPEN</a> member Sunghoon would be the first K-pop star to be a torchbearer at the Winter Games, where he would be carrying the Olympic flame during the torch relay. He is only the second K-pop singer overall after <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jin-to-be-first-torch-bearer-at-2024-paris-olympics-louvre-section-on-july-14-know-details-1327322">BTS&rsquo; Jin</a>, who participated in the relay as a torchbearer during the Paris 2024 Olympics, as his first post-military official activity.</p>

<p><strong>Sunghoon shares thoughts on becoming an Olympic torchbearer</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday morning, BELIFT LAB announced that their artist, ENHYPEN&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/when-ives-jang-wonyoung-and-enhypens-sunghoon-surprised-fans-with-a-refreshing-cover-of-bts-butter-watch-1357658">Sunghoon</a>, would be carrying the torch as a part of the upcoming 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.

<p>&ldquo;Personally, during my days as an athlete, it was my dream to participate in the Olympics. It feels like I&rsquo;ve now achieved that dream as a singer, so I&rsquo;m delighted and honored,&rdquo; he added, referring to his pre-debut athletic career as a figure skater. He was a reserve member of the South Korean national figure skating team and was actively involved in the sports field from 2010 to early 2020. Being an ambassador for the Korean Sport &amp; Olympic Committee, Sunghoon has made his mark as a singer and as a former athlete in the world of sports.</p>

<p>The 2026 Winter Olympics torchbearing ceremony will be held on February 6, 2026, at the San Siro football stadium in Milan. Previously, Heated Rivalry stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie were announced as fellow torchbearers for their viral portrayals of ice hockey players Shane Hunter and Ilya Rosanov.

The request was reviewed by the Korea Heritage Service on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>BTS to hold large free concert at Seoul&#39;s historical spots&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Cultural Heritage Committee reviewed HYBE&rsquo;s request to use and film at its desired locations. As per The Korea Times, after a meeting, it was decided that the agency can make conditional usage of Gyeongbok Palace, such as Geunjeongmun Gate and Heungnyemun Gate, Gwanghwamun, and Woldae (stone platform zone), as well as Sungnyemun (Namdaemun). Pre-recorded content has been allowed to be shot at the venues, with the filming planned for the days the spots remain closed, like Tuesdays.</p>

<p>According to the GN News, pre-filming and media fa&ccedil;ade production were requested, alongside a free concert with attendance limited to 15,000 to 20,000, with advance applications accepted. However, details like the approved attendance number are yet to be confirmed. The original demand was said to be for the March 20 comeback date as well as the following weekend of March 21 and 22, as per Allkpop. The Seoul Plaza is also being eyed for a separate event on Saturday of the week with an expected attendance of 30,000. BTS&rsquo; agency is reportedly planning to stream the events live globally to millions of fans of the group via OTT platforms.</p>

<p>So far, it has been announced that BTS will make a comeback to the music scene this March after a span of three years and nine months with the full-length album, ARIRANG.

In response to the claims, BIGHIT MUSIC has stated that discussions are still ongoing and that official confirmations will be made later.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS contemplates plans to take over iconic Korean locations for album release</strong></p>

<p>Amid reports of holding a free concert at Gwanghwamun Square, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-confirms-new-album-release-on-march-20-wipes-off-instagram-with-group-celebrating-new-year-at-rms-home-1399552">BTS</a>&rsquo; agency said to Newsen, &quot;We are currently discussing it, and an official announcement will be made once the location and schedule are finalized.&quot; It is being said that the company has applied to the National Heritage Administration for permission to use and film not just Gwanghwamun Square but also the historically important Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Sungnyemun Gate area.

<p>Previously, BTS announced the release of their 5th full-length album, Arirang, on March 20, 2026.

He is an undisputed King of the list, having ruled for numerous consecutive years, and only a few other K-pop stars have occasionally surpassed him, only for the singer to be back at the number one spot once again in the following month. The start of 2026 is no different, as the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-announces-34-city-world-tour-starting-april-2026-india-missing-from-list-with-more-concerts-planned-1399884">BTS</a> member was once again crowned the leader of the list of brand reputation rankings for individual K-pop boy group members.</p>

<p><strong>Jimin continues on top position in K-pop boy group popularity</strong></p>

V grabbed the sixth rank, J-Hope the 10th, SUGA the 20th, and finally, leader RM the 26th. Interestingly, 5 out of 7 members of the team managed to be in the top 10, even though the group is yet to release any new music since the end of their military break in June 2025. Six months on, they continue to win the favor of fans.</p>

<p>Unmissable from the reputation list is BIGBANG&rsquo;s leader G-Dragon, who has nabbed the second spot on the rankings amid his ongoing tour and year-end award show appearances, as well as new concert announcements. EXO&rsquo;s Baekhyun has impressed with his fourth spot standing amid solo fan meetings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wanna One&rsquo;s Kang Daniel, NU&rsquo;EST and Wanna One&rsquo;s Hwang Minhyun, the former of whom revealed his military enlistment plans and the latter who returned after completing his service, have both grabbed the interest of fans. Meanwhile, TWS&rsquo;s Dohoon, whose cuteness Overdrive challenge with fellow members, has taken over the internet.&nbsp;</p>

They are known to have filmed the music video at the end of last year, with photoshoots for the album cover and more seemingly being done soon after. A large-scale promotional cycle is expected for this return to the music scene.</p>

<p>The drop of the DEADLINE album comes over seven months since the release of their last digital single, JUMP, which met the world on July 11, 2025. The group has since been on a world tour, which is all set to conclude on January 26, 2026, in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-adds-2-shows-to-deadline-world-tour-across-singapore-and-hong-kong-know-new-schedule-1397004">Hong Kong&rsquo;s Kai Tak Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>After much speculation and unconfirmed rumors that have riddled the comeback of the girl group amid their ongoing world tour, the announcement comes as a necessary respite for fans. Previously reported to be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">releasing in November</a>, which was then changed to&nbsp;the end of 2025, following a revelation from YG Entertainment founder Yang Hyun Suk himself, the record was pushed further to seemingly improve its quality. Now, the plans have been confirmed for the new album as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/boyfriend-on-demand-first-look-blackpinks-jisoo-and-seo-in-guk-are-each-others-undoing-in-romance-k-drama-1399734">Jisoo</a>, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-and-blackpinks-jennie-make-unexpected-cameos-at-2026-golden-globe-awards-heres-how-1399840">Jennie</a>, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa continue their world tour.</p>

<p>Amid all the excitement, Indian fans of BTS who have long been waiting for any update on the group&rsquo;s visit to the country may have to wait longer. After member V hinted at the team coming to the South Asian land for their tour stop, there is no Indian city among the 34 names announced for the upcoming tour so far. However, all hope may not be lost as the poster for the stops also revealed that more dates will be announced later, including stops in Japan, the Middle East, and other places.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the group is also gearing up to release a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-confirms-new-album-release-on-march-20-wipes-off-instagram-with-group-celebrating-new-year-at-rms-home-1399552">new album on March 20, 2026</a>, as previously announced. It would be their first new album in over three years and nine months. Called their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-announces-14-track-5th-album-all-we-know-so-far-about-release-pre-order-world-tour-schedule-and-rumored-dua-lipa-collab-1399652">5th regular album</a> as of now, the full-length record has not yet revealed its name to the public, with many even speculating that it would be an eponymous release for the group, marking their historic return. With the tour drop, it seems only more plausible due to the absence of a tour name.</p>

On January 11 local time, the much-awaited <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/2026-golden-globes-selena-gomez-makes-1st-red-carpet-appearance-as-wife-with-benny-blanco-jennifer-lawrence-ariana-grande-bring-a-game-1399826">2026 Golden Globe Awards</a> were held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, USA. In attendance were Lisa and SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Joshua, who represented K-pop at the ceremony. But fellow member Jennie and Bangtan Sonyeondan were also a part of the event in their own ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the ceremony, fans noticed that BTS&rsquo; Dynamite, the song released about 6 years ago, still found its way to the masses, especially all the celebrities attending the Golden Globes. The group&rsquo;s first-ever track to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart&rsquo;s No. 1 is still relevant and very much loved by fans as well as award ceremonies, as one could see. It was played during the announcement of the Best Podcast award at the Golden Globe Awards. During the broadcast, fans could see Amy Poehler getting up to receive her trophy for her podcast, Good Hang with Amy Poehler, as it grabbed the win.</p>

<p>BLACKPINK member Jennie may not be at the event in person, but her music made its way to the celebratory evening. The 2025 released song, Like JENNIE, which became viral for its catchy tunes and trendy hook steps, was running in the background as Jennifer Lopez presented an award at the 83rd Golden Globes. While she was announcing the winner for Best Male Actor Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, the song rang in, showcasing its unbeatable stronghold on the general public.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lisa makes historical Golden Globes debut</strong></p>

<p>Lalisa Manobal, the Thai BLACKPINK member, officially became the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/83rd-golden-globes-blackpinks-lisa-seventeens-joshua-and-lee-byung-hun-bring-the-glam-pics-1399827">first K-pop act to present an award</a> at the Golden Globes. She took hold of the red carpet with a stunning black sheer piece, which she later changed to wear a grey-silver dress while presenting. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/2026-golden-globe-awards-priyanka-chopra-fixes-nick-jonas-tie-on-red-carpet-stuns-in-strapless-blue-dior-gown-1399824">Priyanka Chopra</a> joined her as the two giggled away, announcing the Best Actor in a TV Series-Drama Award.</p>

<p>Korean actor Lee Byung Hun was also a part of the guestlist following his meaningful contribution to works like Squid Game 3 and KPop Demon Hunters in 2025.</p>

On January 11, a notice from his agency informed the fans of his plans to begin his enlistment on February 9, 2026. The period of his military service is expected to be for one year and six months. Having previously decided to step away from active promotions with his team MONSTA X, the singer has reportedly undergone rehabilitation, which allows him to participate in an upcoming group concert in their home country of South Korea.</p>

<p><strong>I.M. locks military enlistment date</strong></p>

<p>Starship Entertainment has announced plans for I.M.&rsquo;s military enlistment a month later. They also added, &quot;We are pleased to inform you that I.M. will be participating in the 2025 MONSTA X WORLD TOUR [THE X: NEXUS] Seoul concert.&quot; The same will be held just a week before his enlistment. The two days of the show, January 30 and February 1, will mark his last team activity before he takes a hiatus. As per the standard regulations, he is expected to be discharged from service in the fourth quarter of 2027. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A separate notice from his own team spoke about his plans to enter basic military training, which will be followed by his military service lasting 18 months in total.<br />
&ldquo;Hello, this is Team I.M.<br />
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the fans who continue to support I.M.<br />
We are writing to provide an update regarding his upcoming military service.<br />
I.M will enlist at a recruit training center on February 9, 2026, to undergo basic military training, after which he will serve as an active-duty soldier in the Army.<br />
No official event will be held on the day of his enlistment. Since the enlistment ceremony is an event attended by many service members and their families, we kindly ask for your understanding and cooperation in refraining from visiting the site to ensure safety and maintain order.<br />
We ask for your continued love and support until I.M faithfully completes his service and returns in good health.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With I.M.&rsquo;s military enlistment and discharge, all six members of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/throwback-when-monsta-x-unknowingly-helped-seventeen-exit-escape-room-with-100-points-on-karaoke-watch-1337822">MONSTA X</a> would have completed their service, with the only leader, Shownu, having served as a public service worker and the rest as active duty soldiers. The group is expected to reunite at the end of 2027 as a full group, ending their military era.</p>

<p>Moreover, the group also confirmed a world tour with the official announcement of their schedule coming in on January 14 at 12 am.</p>

<p>Previously, a display was placed at the Sejong Center in Seoul on Sunday with the logo of BTS&rsquo; upcoming album, declaring that they&rsquo;re back. The design of the three circles, earlier seen in their personal letters to fans, showcased a sun which the fans have linked to the possible name of the record. It will be the longest release for the group, for which they&rsquo;ve given their admirers plenty of time to prepare.</p>

<p>The announcement was met with enthusiasm from the fans who managed to crash the Weverse website shortly after the update was posted. It further ignited multiple rumors online, including the possibility of a Dua Lipa feature on a track; it only remains speculation as of now.</p>

<p>Interestingly, just as the clock struck 12 am on December 31 and January 1 began, the whole of BTS&rsquo; Instagram was cleared off. Over 1700 posts were archived to start the new chapter in the group&rsquo;s music career. Not only that, but the group&rsquo;s overall social media was changed, with their Weverse and Twitter profiles undergoing a visible move to a black and white theme, no sign of their photos in sight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seven boys were at leader RM&rsquo;s new house and decided to conduct an impromptu livestream to ring in the New Year with their fans. Sitting on one big couch, bickering and sharing their hope for a fruitful 2026, they bowed their heads in true Korean tradition and wished for a successful music comeback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a note shared by her agency, WITH US Entertainment, the 32-year-old&rsquo;s decision to marry her beau was shared. It reads, &ldquo;We are sharing our official position regarding the update reported today about Yoon Bomi. She is set to marry her cherished partner, who has been by her side for a long time, in May of next year. We ask for your warm support for the couple as they embark on this new chapter of their lives.<br />
Even after marriage, Yoon Bomi plans to continue her steady activities without change as a member of Apink, as an actress, and as an entertainer. She will return with a more mature and responsible image to repay the fans who have always supported her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similarly, the to-be-groom&rsquo;s side also shared their confirmation, &ldquo;Our chief producer Rado (real name Song Joo Young) has met a cherished partner and will be getting married in May of next year. Even after marriage, Rado plans to continue to devote himself to music as the representative producer of High Up Entertainment. We ask for your warm blessings for the couple&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bomi then took to her official fan cafe to share a handwritten note, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to spend the rest of my life with someone who has been by my side for a long time while sharing our everyday lives and being together through both happy times and difficult moments. I didn&rsquo;t know I would be delivering this news like this, but I really wanted to convey my feelings to PANDA, who are like my long-time friends, first.&rdquo; She apologized for letting her life update be conveyed via an article first, as well as for her personal decision to take this step, even as fans await news about Apink&rsquo;s new music after 3 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rado has previously worked on the girl group&rsquo;s releases like Only one and I&rsquo;m so sick, alongside being the producer for multiple K-pop hits for STAYC, TWICE, Chung Ha, Sistar, and MissA. Originally part of a duo alongside Choi Kyu Sung, Black Eyed Pilseung split up earlier this year over creative differences after 16 years together.</p>

Girl and boy groups, as well as solo acts, it was one exciting release after another. Here&rsquo;s a look at some of our favorites releases in no particular order.</p>

<p><strong>1. Jennie Like JENNIE: </strong>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-adds-2-shows-to-deadline-world-tour-across-singapore-and-hong-kong-know-new-schedule-1397004">BLACKPINK</a> member made an inimitable impact on the music scene this year. With solo music show appearances and global performances, everyone could only talk about Jennie, and she ensured that her songs did too. Like JENNIE&rsquo;s repetitive tune became a total earworm, and the choreography invited countless to participate.</p>

<p><strong>2. J-Hope Killin&rsquo; It Girl: </strong>The dance master was back, and he made sure everyone knew it. Baring his abs for the first time around, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-ot7-livestream-rm-gets-drivers-license-group-reveals-year-end-plans-and-wonders-if-suga-secretly-got-married-1399179">BTS</a> member geared up for his solo adventure with this collaboration alongside GloRilla, who featured on a verse.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Thunder:</strong> The thirteen-member team gave the last bow before their military era with another powerful number. Knife-like dance moves aside, Thunder made its way into party playlists without letting anyone realise it and held onto its position.</p>

<p><strong>4. KATSEYE&rsquo;s Gnarly: </strong>Noise music, thought you&rsquo;d never get accustomed to it? The girl group managed to bring on a lot of chatter around their new song, with differing opinions surrounding them. Soon after, everyone was obsessed with the track, and just like that, KATSEYE had another winner on their hands.</p>

<p><strong>5. HUNTRIX&rsquo;s (Ejae, Audrey Nuna, Rei Ami) Golden: </strong>The world was (and still is) painted golden earlier this year. Unexpectedly, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/kpop-demon-hunters-sequel-greenlit-as-animated-film-becomes-netflixs-most-watched-with-236-million-views-1396144">KPop Demon Hunters</a> took over everyone&rsquo;s lives with a fabulous storyline and animation, but its music more so. The track has become an anthem full of encouragement and has made millions of fans of a fictional K-pop group.</p>

<p><strong>6. NMIXX&rsquo;s Blue Valentine: </strong>The JYP Entertainment girl group&rsquo;s success is long overdue. With music spanning across many genres, the team has always kept it interesting, and this time was no different. Blue Valentine began small but is now enjoying a steady run on charts, and for all the right reasons.</p>

<p><strong>7. ALLDAY PROJECT&rsquo;s FAMOUS: </strong>One of the most awaited debuts of the year happened with THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s ADP, where a chaebol heiress, a former ILLIT member, a former Trainee A member, a popular choreographer, and an influencer would come together. The co-ed team managed to grab eyeballs right from the start with a song that read, &lsquo;we ain&rsquo;t even famous.&rsquo; What a power move!</p>

<p><strong>8. CORTIS&rsquo; GO:</strong> After BTS and TXT, what was next for BIGHIT MUSIC? The famed K-pop agency showed off its cards with CORTIS, who made everyone GO crazy with easy dance moves and a catchy tune.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. Dayoung&rsquo;s Body: </strong>The most unpredictable success of the year came along with WJSN&rsquo;s Dayoung, who made a notorious debut on the charts and rose to the heights. The single brought along a fun dance challenge and showed off her strong traits.</p>

<p><strong>10. Hwasa&rsquo;s Good Goodbye: </strong>One music video, a long letter, and a viral award moment, Hwasa and actor Park Jung Min hoodwinked everyone with their romantic performance. Soon, the song caught the general public&rsquo;s attention and resulted in Perfect All Kills on music charts.</p>

<p><strong>Special Mentions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Saja Boys&rsquo; (Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, Samuil Lee) Soda Pop: </strong>It was the year of KPop Demon Hunters and what&rsquo;s talking about the animated film if not about the very hunters. True, blue K-pop, the song received dance covers and cosplay attempts from famed K-pop stars themselves, including ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Jay and WONHO.</p>

<p><strong>KATSEYE&rsquo;s Gabriela: </strong>The only act to have two songs on our list, Gabriela was an unexpected hit with catchy lyrics but even catchier dance moves. The hand swirls ignited attention from anyone and everyone watching their performances.</p>

<p><strong>TXT&rsquo;s Love Language: </strong>TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s comeback was long-awaited by fans, and the quintet delivered a fabulous show once again. With swift choreography and their princely charms bleeding into their music, the track was another fast seller.&nbsp;</p>

As RM, Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook joined in for a chat with their fans after a long time, the familiar chaotic feel set in. And while they spoke about everything and nothing in particular, a big announcement dropped from the leader, who revealed that he had finally gotten his driver&rsquo;s license.</p>

<p><strong>BTS member RM receives a driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-did-rm-say-its-time-to-disband-bts-know-truth-behind-hilarious-livestream-exchange-with-jimin-1398647">RM</a> was the only <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/park-seo-joon-picks-if-he-would-attend-bts-v-or-park-hyung-siks-marriage-should-they-fall-on-same-day-1399146">BTS</a> member who was without a driver&rsquo;s license and would need to be driven around. However, that has changed now as the star revealed how he had managed to succeed in his driving test. J-Hope teased him that there were rumors he failed it once, and the rapper added how he ended up surpassing a line in the center while making a U-turn due to the wiped away paint, but in the end, he received his driver&rsquo;s license. The members congratulated him on successfully doing so and asked him to take the wheel the next time they&rsquo;re out. The BTS leader added that he could drive but needed practice with parking.</p>

<p>The most common comment during the team&rsquo;s livestream continues to be &lsquo;Yoongi marry me,&rsquo; aimed at member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-suga-fulfills-2-year-old-promise-to-fans-teases-possible-new-project-with-return-to-instagram-pics-1397116">SUGA</a>. The members asked the rapper if he had secretly gotten married without their knowledge. Meanwhile, Jimin shared that by this time, he must have someone in his heart. The hilarious situation made everyone laugh out loud.</p>

<p>Their discussions about the upcoming album continued, and as the fans asked the members to keep turning on the livestream often, they decided to do a year-end party where they would wear suits. Just like this, an upcoming live session was planned for BTS ARMY to look forward to. While the grandeur of Jin&rsquo;s house made them want to host it there, the boys decided to stick to the company office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTS has recently been working on their comeback album, said to be released in March 2026, with all songs reportedly already recorded.</p>

With the BTS member being linked to actress Lee Yu Bi in 2021, a swift denial from HYBE settled the waters. Earlier this year, aespa&rsquo;s agency shut down claims of her being romantically involved with ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Jungwon and shared that they&rsquo;d be taking legal action against the rumormonger instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, HYBE revealed that BTS member Jimin had been previously meeting TV personality and actress Song Da Eun with &lsquo;good feelings&rsquo; before, but the two have not spoken in many years, as new videos from their time together resurfaced on the internet. They have not confirmed any relationships involving other BTS members.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-12/1282526256_twice-stray-kids-1.webp"></img><p>JYP Entertainment, one of the biggest K-pop entertainment agencies in the world, may soon be heading to India! According to a report from The Korea Herald, the South Korean media giant is eyeing the 1.4 billion market in India next. Previously, HYBE, home to Grammy-nominated act BTS, SEVENTEEN, ENHYPEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, and more famed K-pop acts, launched its fifth overseas branch in Mumbai. If the JY Park-founded company also confirms its standing in the country, it would become the second major label to do so.</p>

<p><strong>What are the plans by JYP Entertainment to enter India?</strong></p>

<p>According to the report, an industry source shared, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/stray-kids-twices-agency-jyp-entertainment-ranked-third-on-worlds-best-companies-in-sustainable-growth-2025-list-1361181">JYP Entertainment</a> is preparing to open its office in India to target the local music market. The exact location or timeline has not been decided, but the timing seems right as K-pop&rsquo;s popularity continues to rise among younger generations in India.&rdquo; However, the agency itself has not confirmed so, instead saying that they&rsquo;re unaware of any such plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India would be fourth in the management label&rsquo;s international functions following its operations in the United States, Japan, and China. The popularity of JYP Entertainment groups, including TWICE and Stray Kids, is as high as ever, with the latter even seeking <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/stray-kids-bang-chan-reveals-turning-to-bollywood-music-for-ceremony-comeback-took-inspiration-from-indian-music-1396052">inspiration from Indian music</a> for one of its recent releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, G-Dragon&rsquo;s company, Galaxy Corporation, was rumored to be eyeing a branch in India after looking at the rapid growth of the country and HYBE&rsquo;s entry into the music scene. The latter has already set up office and is looking for professionals to join their team, with job opportunities set up. The BIGBANG member&rsquo;s label is yet to share any concrete details, with apparently only market research being conducted as of now. They currently run teams in Japan, the US, and Hong Kong, with a Singapore office that does not run independently, making India their fourth possible launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from TWICE and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/2025-k-world-dream-awards-full-winners-list-stray-kids-ive-txt-and-kpop-demon-hunters-take-big-accolades-1395932">Stray Kids</a>, JYP Entertainment is the home to 2PM, Day6, ITZY, NMIXX, KickFlip, and more, providing a wide range of artist experiences.&nbsp;</p>

The team that debuted in 2023 and comprises 9 members will complete their term with the management label in January 2026. However, on December 1, 202,5 it was announced that SUNG HAN BIN, KIM JI WOONG, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/zerobaseones-zhang-hao-does-damage-control-after-failing-to-recognize-apt-is-blackpinks-roses-song-watch-1354882">ZHANG HAO</a>, SEOK MATTHEW, KIM TAE RAE, RICKY, KIM GYU VIN, PARK GUN WOOK, and HAN YU JIN have decided to extend their activities for another 2 months. The team revealed plans for an encore concert, which will continue their official promotions through to March.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s what ZB1 shared on their social media, confirming their extension of contract&nbsp;</strong><br />
&ldquo;Notice Regarding ZEROBASEONE&#39;s Upcoming Plans<br />
Hello, this is WAKEONE.<br />
First of all, we would like to sincerely thank all ZEROSE for your unwavering love and support for ZEROBASEONE. We would like to provide an update regarding ZEROBASEONE&#39;s upcoming plans.<br />
After sincere in-depth discussions with all 9 members of ZEROBASEONE<br />
(SUNG HAN BIN, KIM JI WOONG, ZHANG HAO, SEOK MATTHEW, KIM TAE RAE, RICKY, KIM GYU VIN, PARK GUN WOOK, HAN YU JIN), the company and the members have mutually agreed to extend ZEROBASEONE&#39;s group activities for an additional 2 months.<br />
This decision was reached unanimously by all ZEROBASEONE members, who hold deep affection for the team and wish to repay the great love they have received from the fans.<br />
Accordingly, ZEROBASEONE will continue promoting as a full team, and they will also meet the fans at the upcoming &lt;2025 ZEROBASEONE WORLD TOUR &#39;HERE&amp;NOW&#39;&gt; encore concert and share precious moments together.<br />
With this extension, the 3rd Global Official Fanclub &#39;ZEROSE&#39; will be automatically extended without any additional payment, and Plus Chat services will also continue without change. Further details will be provided in a separate notice later.<br />
We kindly ask for your continued love and support for ZEROBASEONE&#39;s journey.<br />
WAKEONE will also do its utmost to ensure that every moment shared between ZEROBASEONE and ZEROSE shines even brighter.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This new move has, however, instilled another worry in the fans of the group who think that disbandment may soon dawn upon them. Having won 10 rookie awards, the boys of ZEROBASEONE possess a large global fanbase that has long been waiting for an update regarding the continuation of their activities under the same roof. The team last released their first studio album, Never Say Neve,r in September this year, followed by a Japanese EP. They are ready to resume their world tour soon, which will continue in the coming months, extending to March 2026.</p>

<p>The BTS members are some of the most well-earning K-pop acts of this generation. With millions of fans worldwide who buy millions of albums and stream their songs billions of times, alongside brand endorsements and real estate properties, as well as personal investments, they&rsquo;re high up on the rich Korean entertainers&rsquo; list. This has allowed them to have expensive tastes and buy some of the most luxurious items, with V being a frontrunner.</p>

<p>Leith Ford has reported that the 2025 Ford Mustang GTD costs up to around 325,000 USD, with some other estimates high-balling it to 350K USD. Previously, V was seen arriving at the airport in a Bentley Flying Spur Car instead of a company SUV last month. In December 2021, the star shared a video driving a red Ford Mustang Convertible while on vacation; however, that seemed to be a rented spin for his vacation. It appears that his 4-year-old test run resulted in a real-life buy for the star.&nbsp;</p>

The members all jetted off to Los Angeles, where they stayed under the same roof after many years, and while the rest of them were able to work on new music together, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/watch-bts-jin-unable-to-continue-with-moon-intro-as-fans-make-him-laugh-gets-emotional-at-pink-epiphany-project-1395239">Jin</a> was selling out arenas as a part of the RUNSEOKJIN_EP TOUR. Later, when he joined them back for a few weeks together, it seems that the singer had a blast and was once again reminded of their musical skills.</p>

<p><strong>Jin gets blown away by fellow BTS members&rsquo; musical ability</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the Spur magazine, the singer revealed his shock over the results of the new music that they had managed to create in such a short time. &ldquo;While the members were working on producing the new songs in America, I joined them a little later because of my solo tour. Listening to the songs they had created during the time I was away, I was deeply moved by their level of completion and artistic quality. When I reunited with the members and heard their music, I once again strongly felt, &lsquo;These people are truly remarkable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/sugas-mind-program-concert-sells-out-tickets-organizers-reveals-if-bts-member-will-attend-1398622">BTS</a> reunion has long been the center of attention for many who have been waiting for them to come back and take over the K-pop music scene. Slowly and surely, the seven members of the team have been seen preparing for the new album set to be released around March 2026. They recently wrapped up the recording for their album and were known to have begun revising some necessary parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jin recently announced the release of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jin-announces-runseokjin_ep-tour-the-movie-releasing-on-december-27-until-the-day-i-meet-every-army-1398600">RUNSEOKJIN_EP TOUR THE MOVIE</a> in global theaters, screening December 27 onwards. It will capture the release of his solo albums and his embarking on a global tour across 10 cities and 20 performances, where he challenged the fans for a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>

The rapper funded the creation of a treatment center in his name, and now that it&rsquo;s functional, there are new and exciting opportunities that the star is spreading. Recently, a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-sugas-mind-program-arranges-first-ever-concert-with-his-tour-band-for-autistic-kids-fans-praise-singer-1398540">concert called Shining MINDS</a> was announced as a part of the promotion of the Min Yoongi Treatment Center, which will focus on providing a platform for kids on the autistic spectrum. It was also revealed that SUGA Crew, the instrumental members who provided live band during the star&rsquo;s Agust D, D-Day tour, will be performing at the concert.</p>

<p><strong>SUGA skips the MIND program concert</strong></p>

<p>The director of the Min Yoongi treatment center shared that as soon as the ticketing was opened for the MIND Program&rsquo;s upcoming concert, it sold out immediately, showing the wildly impactful influence of the Korean star. Excitement is at an all-time high considering the functioning of the show and whether their main sponsor, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/winners-seungyoon-says-thankful-for-bts-jin-recalling-close-bond-during-military-he-contacted-me-first-1398558">BTS</a> member SUGA, will be attending the concert to observe it.</p>

<p>A statement was shared by the organizers denying the possibility of his arrival, clarifying that, in order to avoid overcrowding, they have decided to reveal it. &ldquo;To prevent congestion on the day of the event, on-site ticket purchases will not be available. For order and safety on the day of the concert, we inform you in advance that the center&rsquo;s sponsor, SUGA, will not be attending the event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This has made it clear that SUGA will be cheering for the event from afar while he works on new BTS music. Previously, he accompanied fellow group members to Los Angeles for two months, where they worked with skilled producers and composers for their 2026 album. The post-military comeback will mark the first new BTS music in over 3.5 years and is all set to drop in spring, around the time of March, as previously teased by leader RM.</p>

The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/watch-bts-jin-unable-to-continue-with-moon-intro-as-fans-make-him-laugh-gets-emotional-at-pink-epiphany-project-1395239">RUNSEOKJIN_EP.

<p>BTS member Jin&rsquo;s RUNSEOKJIN_EP. TOUR THE MOVIE will screen around the world from December 27 to December 28, 2025, globally and from December 31 onwards in South Korea. A statement released on the sign-up page of his film, Jin the movie, revealed his plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jin has embarked on his first journey to connect with ARMY, whether in person or online. Spanning 10 cities and 20 performances - from Goyang to Japan, North America, Europe, and back to Incheon - the most thrilling moments of the tour are now ready to unfold on the big screen.<br />
With &quot;challenge&quot; as its theme, the show sees &quot;Worldwide Handsome&quot; Jin bring his signature energy to the stage, laughing, singing, and completing missions with ARMY across five energetic rounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The notice also revealed how the film would cover the performances of his most important first solo album, Happy, which was backed by a live band, to his second mini-album, Echo, as well as his showcase of BTS songs. It phrased the invitation from Jin himself as he takes you to a year-end party focusing on his solo concerts that became the highlight for thousands of fans this year.</p>

<p>This will make for the 3rd of its kind film for the group, following similar versions for members <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/j-hope-brings-up-sugas-name-while-rapping-brand-new-day-track-bts-army-bursts-into-tears-yoongi-we-miss-you-1387807">SUGA and J-Hope</a> who went on their own solo tours following the release of their individual albums.</p>

<p>The tickets for the event have been priced at 20,000 KRW (approximately 13.7 USD) as shared in the post by the director of the treatment center.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, SUGA has been mostly away from the public eye ever since his discharge from mandatory military service, where he enlisted in alternate duty. He was seen accompanying fellow BTS members to Los Angeles, where the group stayed for a couple of months, working on their new album, rumored to be released in March 2026. The team members were said to have recently wrapped up their recording process and have now been revising their content.

It seems that Galaxy Corp., which houses <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/g-dragon-speaks-about-wanting-to-get-married-opens-up-on-meeting-bigbang-bandmate-taeyangs-kid-1398270">G-Dragon</a> and is behind productions like the famed Netflix reality TV show, Physical: 100, is eyeing India for its new branch.</p>

<p><strong>G-Dragon&rsquo;s company eyes its Indian arm</strong></p>

<p>Galaxy Corporation currently has its offices in Japan, the US, and Hong Kong, as well as a virtual branch in Singapore. With India adding to the bunch, a solid task force presents itself at the core of K-pop, backed by the agency&rsquo;s experience. A source shared with The Korea Herald, &ldquo;Galaxy Corp.&rsquo;s business division is conducting market research related to entry into India and is also working on establishing an Indian subsidiary. At the end of last year, G-Dragon&rsquo;s team also inquired locally about concert demand and performance guarantees for the artist&rsquo;s solo show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If it comes true, the Seoul-based entertainment tech firm would become the second one to enter the Indian market after HYBE launched its office in Mumbai earlier this year. The close to one and a half billion population in the South Asian country is expected to welcome it with a warm reception, with the first of its displays being eyed via a Jungkook exhibition. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkooks-golden-the-moments-exhibition-comes-to-india-this-december-know-how-and-where-to-attend-1398219">GOLDEN : The Moments</a> is all set to run at the Mehboob Studios in Mumbai.</p>

<p>BIGBANG is also said to be preparing for a 2026 comeback, with all three members- G-Dragon, Taeyang, and Daesung, expected to join. The group was announced as one of the headliners at the upcoming Coachella in 2026.&nbsp;Also, the Melon Music Awards 2025 announced that BIGBANG&#39;s G-Dragon will be joining the lineup, all set to happen at Seoul&rsquo;s Gocheok Sky Dome on December 20.</p>

The news of their dating was met with a lot of support from fans on both sides; however, their busy schedules acted as a catalyst for their break-up, leaving many reeling from sadness. The songstress has now spoken up about her definition of perfect love and whether she&rsquo;s working hard to love herself.</p>

<p><strong>Jisoo reveals how she feels about love</strong><br />
As revealed by Elle Korea, the Snowdrop star,&nbsp;when asked about love and its most perfect form, said, &ldquo;Most human emotions are connected to love, so I think it&rsquo;s only natural that I end up talking about all different kinds of love. There&rsquo;s no such thing as perfect love. Maybe the final stage of love is living with each other while trying to understand one another as much as possible, getting as close to perfection as we can.&rdquo; Her words come as advice and a reminder to fans of her many songs that are framed around the concept of romance and how affection always finds its way into her life and art.</p>

<p>A lot of her music centers around love, including her solo album AMORTAGE and her most recent collaboration, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jisoo-marks-billboard-hot-100-debut-with-eyes-closed-featuring-zayn-malik-marks-big-milestone-for-blackpink-1397871">EYES CLOSED</a> with Zayn Malik, formerly of One Direction.</p>

<p>Amid her journey to seek love, Jisoo is falling back to the basics and remembering how, amid everything, she will have her ownself. She said, &quot;I&#39;ve always lived my life loving myself and taking good care of myself. I just hope I can continue to do so. When times get tough, I always have myself, so I hope I can overcome them without wavering even at the slightest gust of wind.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently, the 30-year-old is touring the globe alongside her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-extend-deadline-tour-with-concerts-in-chinas-beijing-national-stadium-fans-predict-tickets-to-sell-like-hot-cakes-1394275">BLACKPINK</a> mates.

They added that the videos seemed old, especially considering the similar house entrance, emphasizing BIGHIT MUSIC&rsquo;s words that they had not spoken in many years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many even allege that the two had probably been living in the same apartment building back then, considering Song Da Eun&rsquo;s recent claims of facing financial difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTS is known to be currently working on their spring 2026 album. The team stayed in Los Angeles for 2 months while working on it and is said to have completed recording it.

From her singing debut to her acting career, her endorsement game, as well as launching a new agency with her brother, the star has captured it all. Now it seems her older sister, Kim Ji Yoon, is not leaving any stones unturned either; she&rsquo;s marching ahead to establish her own name in the field. It was previously reported that she will be joining the ENA survival show Super Seller: Incentive Game to covet the winning prize of 300 million KRW.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Super Seller: Incentive Game puts 40 sellers from a myriad of fields and various levels of experience to compete in a survival show that determines the winner with the help of sales directly, not needing any judges or further criteria in the competition. All set to air its first episode on November 14, 2025, at 10:30 pm KST (7 pm IST), the program has already previewed a stacked lineup of contestants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from Kim Ji Yoon, the older sibling of the globally popular K-pop star, industry veterans, including Home Shopping Queen Sra Sim from Company C, mobile commerce icon Seo Kyung Hwan, TV show host Lee Chang Woo, YouTuber Malwang, engineering graduate and creator Kim Ddolddol, fashion YouTuber KangtheStylist, magician Choi Hyun Woo, and Jang Won Young lookalike influencer Jihani, have joined the show.</p>

<p><strong>About Jisoo&rsquo;s sister, Kim Ji Yoon</strong><br />
It is said that Kim Ji Yoon is a former flight attendant and is believed to be 35 years old. Apart from that, it is known that she&rsquo;s married and has two sons. Her appearance, teased earlier on the show, created a wave of surprise as fellow participants tried to belittle her and saw her as an easy hurdle to cross while on the path to win the game. However, the possible turn of events has already created excitement among the viewers.&nbsp;</p>

Here’s what we know ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-11/520357877_kris-wu.webp"></img><p><strong>Trigger Warning: Some readers may find the following content disturbing. Please proceed with caution.</strong></p>

<p>Kris Wu, the former member of K-pop boy group <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exos-lay-hints-at-possible-involvement-in-full-group-comeback-in-2025-after-4-year-hiatus-fans-react-1365547">EXO</a>, has been at the receiving end of multiple rumors ever since he was imprisoned for 13 years over multiple charges. The latest one is that he has passed away after involving himself with a gang while behind bars as well as rumors of a hunger strike causing his demise. Now, the Chinese police have stepped in to refute all claims surfacing online, confirming that he&rsquo;s alive and denouncing spread of rumors with the threat of legal action.</p>

<p><strong>News of Kris Wu&rsquo;s passing was clarified by the police department in China</strong></p>

<p>Previously, a netizen, who claimed to have been imprisoned in the same prison as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-group-members-1365104">Kris Wu</a>, made a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. &quot;A few days ago, a prison guard secretly said something to me, and then Kris suddenly died,&quot; A wrote. &quot;He was molested by a local gang, and he was killed because he failed to meet the leader&#39;s demands.&quot; Another rumor claimed that his health deteriorated during a hunger strike, leading to his passing.</p>

<p>The posts accompanied an image, the sources of which were unknown, but appeared to be showing the alleged inmate with a prison guard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, according to South Korean media outlets MHN and Sports Chosun&rsquo;s reports, the singer is very much alive. They quoted the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department, sharing that he was living in prison at the moment and had not passed away, as rumors claimed. The concerned photo shared and spread online by netizens is said to have been &ldquo;created by using a past news report screen and replacing the original inmate&rsquo;s face with Kris&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; They also warned rumormongers with a stern statement, &ldquo;Do not disseminate unverified information. You may face legal penalties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kris Wu&rsquo;s prison sentence was confirmed in 2023, and he is known to be currently serving it.</p>

Saying that the agency panics if he gives out any spoilers, he refrained from speaking too much about the album or their new music. However, he assured that he is happy with the turnout. &ldquo;I like this direction of the album, and while I was worried while recording it previously, I think it&rsquo;s working out well now.&rdquo; It was worth their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-in-la-alleged-fan-shares-gym-moment-with-rm-and-v-fans-express-concern-over-location-leak-1393844">time in Los Angeles</a>, shared the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkooks-golden-the-moments-exhibition-comes-to-india-this-december-know-how-and-where-to-attend-1398219">BTS</a> leader. Afterward, he confirmed that there will be new, varied genres that they haven&rsquo;t tried before on the new 2026 album.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for 2026, and we need time, but we&rsquo;ll be back in our [original] state.&rdquo; He also added how they&rsquo;ll surely come to the fans [via a tour], and they&rsquo;re really excited about it. &ldquo;Since everything is coming back to its original place, and we&rsquo;re back as well, it&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; He expressed his wish to visit every continent in the world, towards the latter part of the livestream.</p>

<p><strong>RM quits relying on medication for sleep</strong><br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take medicines [for my insomnia] anymore. I stopped taking them around July, and while I still possess them just in case I need them, I have been sleeping on my own, even if it&rsquo;s late. I don&rsquo;t really need them anymore because if I consume them, then as a person, there are lots of ups and downs, and one may become like a zombie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added that, regardless of everything that has happened with them over the years, they need to stay focused and keep it between them and the fans. &ldquo;There are too many things going around, so I want you to not pay attention and [focus] on the things we do with this album and the things we&rsquo;ll do with you guys.&rdquo; He confirmed that 2026 will be the year of BTS and ARMY.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RM shared that although there&rsquo;s pressure for their comeback, the members are taking it seriously and working hard for good results.</p>

On November 12, the youngest members, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-haerin-and-hyein-return-to-ador-will-comply-with-exclusive-contract-1398385">Haerin and Hyein</a>, announced their decision to return to their label after the recent ruling verifying the validity of their exclusive contracts. Soon after, members <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/after-haerin-and-hyein-newjeans-minji-hanni-and-danielle-also-confirm-return-to-ador-will-show-our-sincere-music-1398390">Minji, Danielle, and Hanni</a> also confirmed via their legal team that they&rsquo;ll be returning to the management after careful discussions amongst themselves. Former CEO Min Hee Jin has now responded to their decision and decided to support them.</p>

<p><strong>Min Hee Jin sends her support to NewJeans amid their ADOR comeback</strong><br />
The ex-CEO of ADOR, Min Hee Jin, who is currently in a battle of her own against HYBE, reacted to all five members. Here&rsquo;s her official stance as reported by Sports Kyunghyang. &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s decision to return [to ADOR] was undoubtedly a difficult choice made by the members after much thought and consideration. I respect and will support that decision. Although there were difficulties, I cherish the courage of the members who have decided to hold hands together again to protect each other. I can start afresh anywhere. However, I think NewJeans should remain together as a group of five members, no matter the situation. I hope that the members will become stronger, that NewJeans will grow into an even better group, and most of all, that all five members are happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added that she will continue to support <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-and-ador-fail-to-reach-settlement-in-contract-dispute-new-mediation-date-allotted-1395611">NewJeans</a>&#39; music and growth until the end amid her own pending issues with the label.</p>

<p>As of now, the future plans of NewJeans are yet to be finalized or revealed to the public. While Haerin and Hyein are said to have confirmed their return with ADOR directly, Minji, Danielle, and Hanni have yet to have individual discussions with the team. They previously shared that one of the members was in Antarctica, leading to the delay of their announcement.</p>

All members, including Minji, Hanni, and Danielle, have confirmed their return to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-and-ador-fail-to-reach-settlement-in-contract-dispute-new-mediation-date-allotted-1395611">ADOR</a> as of November 12, 2025, deciding to respect the recent ruling related to their exclusive contracts. This news comes about an hour after it was announced that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-haerin-and-hyein-return-to-ador-will-comply-with-exclusive-contract-1398385https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-haerin-and-hyein-return-to-ador-will-comply-with-exclusive-contract-1398385">Haerin and Hyein</a> will be returning to their label after careful consideration and discussions with their family, as well as the company. Meanwhile, the label has responded that they&rsquo;re still checking about the three&rsquo;s possible return.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>All five NewJeans lock return to ADOR</strong><br />
According to a Yonhap News report, the three also confirmed their return to ADOR shortly after the news regarding Haerin and Hyein. Here&rsquo;s what they said, &ldquo;Hello, this is Minji, Hanni, and Danielle. Recently, after careful consideration, we have decided to return to ADOR. One of the members is currently in Antarctica, so the announcement of our position was delayed, but since ADOR has not responded to us, we have been forced to share our decision separately. We will continue to show you our sincere music and performances. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement was found to be odd by many, especially considering the continued severed communication between some of the members and the label. Later, the management shared an update on the trio&rsquo;s statement and shared another vague response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are currently looking into the real intentions of the three members&rsquo; statement to return,&rdquo; shared ADOR with Sports Ilgan after learning about Minji, Danielle, and Hanni&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is reported by NewDaily that it was Hyein&rsquo;s father who convinced Haerin&rsquo;s family to let her join back. He was previously rumored to have opposed terminating the group&rsquo;s contract with ADOR and then convinced his own daughter, as well as her fellow <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-newjeans-finally-return-to-ador-members-set-one-non-negotiable-condition-amid-august-14-mediation-1394460">NewJeans</a> member, to return. An alleged custody battle also began between Hyein&rsquo;s mother and father over her removal from the label amid NewJeans&rsquo; dispute with HYBE.</p>

On November 12, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/can-newjeans-hiatus-push-their-ador-contract-beyond-2030-all-we-know-about-suspension-clause-causing-fan-alarm-1392108">ADOR</a> shared a statement on the girl group&rsquo;s social media confirming their intentions to continue as a part of their talent. They have asked to refrain from unfounded rumors and give the utmost support to the two.</p>

<p><strong>Haerin and Hyein return to ADOR and thereby NewJeans</strong><br />
ADOR&rsquo;s statement shared on Wednesday read as follows, &ldquo;We at ADOR would like to inform you. NewJeans members Hyein and Haerin have expressed their intention to continue their activities with ADOR.<br />
After careful consultation with their families and thorough discussions with ADOR,<br />
the two members have made the decision to respect the court&#39;s ruling and comply with the exclusive contract. ADOR will do its utmost to ensure that Hyein and Haerin can continue their entertainment activities smoothly. We kindly ask for the warm support of our fans and respectfully request that you refrain from any unfounded speculation regarding the members. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Minji, Hanni, and Danielle have yet to comment on their fellow members&rsquo; decision to join hands with their management after over a year of dispute. Recently, the five lost their case against ADOR in relation to the validity of their exclusive contracts. Earlier, the group argued for the removal of Min Hee Jin as the CEO of their management company and wished for her reinstatement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The label has denied the same and has appointed Lee Do Kyung as its new CEO. They have also refused mismanagement allegations and provided financial statements as proof. It is not known how NewJeans will proceed with the absence of three out of its five members. Fans have had mixed reactions to the announcement of Haerin and Hyein&rsquo;s return.</p>

According to reports on November 12, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ives-jang-wonyoung-and-2pms-lee-junho-confirmed-as-mcs-for-10th-asia-artist-awards-2025-know-when-its-happening-1381719">IVE</a> member bought a new property at the famed Hannam-dong area in Seoul, South Korea. A unit at the UN Village bears the 21-year-old&rsquo;s name loud and proud, an achievement rare as it comes among 4th-generation K-pop stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jang Wonyoung adds a new real estate property to her net worth</strong></p>

<p>As per the real estate industry and the Supreme Court Registry Office, in a copy acquired by Hankook Kyungjae TV, the singer signed on a 244 sq. meter unit in Lucid House, located in Yongsan-gu, Hannam-dong, Seoul, this March for 13.7 billion KRW (approximately 9.3 million USD). It is said that Jang Wonyoung completed the registration process for the home last month. The feat is even more impressive as it appears that the former IZ*ONE member bought it with no mortgage, leading to assumptions that it was paid for in full cash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, when the particular establishment was first put on sale, it came up to a whopping 4 billion KRW already. The price has appreciated massively in the last 8 years, growing more than three times its original value in such a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within the UN Village, the unit bought by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/are-bts-v-and-ives-jang-wonyoung-dating-alleged-proof-list-surfaces-on-internet-about-k-pop-stars-lovestagram-1397245">Jang Wonyoung</a> is said to be a part of the Lucid House project. It previously housed actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/top-10-highest-paid-korean-actresses-of-all-time-1217905">Kim Tae Hee</a>, who reportedly made over 2 billion KRW profit on it. Meanwhile, the young singer remains an industry favorite, winning with her charms and influence, having become the face of multiple brands over the years. Her market presence and the success of IVE had made her one of the top idols, earning her numerous endorsements individually and as a group.</p>

She has been revealed to be a part of the festival with many famed personalities like herself, including Foo Fighters, Florence + The Machine, Twenty One Pilots, Lorde, Pulp, Wolf Alice, Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds, Moby, and many more. Over 70 artists have been announced as a part of the lineup.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie to headline Mad Cool Festival</strong><br />
Jennie is all set to become the first-ever K-pop act to headline Madrid&rsquo;s Mad Cool Festival, and she&rsquo;s doing so alongside many well-known artists. As a co-headliner, the BLACKPINK member will be performing on Thursday, July 9, 2026. Other performers on the same day include Florence + The Machine, Lorde, Teddy Swims, Zara Larsson, Rene&eacute; Rapp, Charlie Puth, The Blaze, and more.</p>

<p>While her first-ever headliner gig in Spain, this is hardly the first time the songstress has led a music festival. She performed in front of thousands and made them go crazy with her moves earlier this year at Coachella. The tracks from Ruby truly made everyone wish they were Jennie as her songs rose back on music charts and garnered thousands of streams soon after. She trended on social media with &lsquo;Jenchella&rsquo; becoming a top search item and hashtag, proving her global reach and influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jennie is currently in the middle of the BLACKPINK DEADLINE World Tour with Jisoo, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa, as they take over the globe in sold-out concerts. The team is looking to release a new album by the end of this year, with some reports claiming the record has been <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/has-blackpinks-album-been-pushed-to-january-2026-yg-entertainment-responds-to-rumors-of-december-cancelation-1398265">pushed to 2026</a>.</p>

While there have been many rumors of him dating various celebrities and non-celebrities, the singer has yet to settle down for good. Appearing on MBC&#39;s Son Seok Hee&#39;s Questions program, where he was last seen about 10 years ago, the superstar was asked about his plans to tie the knot. Maintaining that he had not found the person he could marry so far, he tried to manifest his wedding. As usual, his humor was top-notch as he joked about hoping that the person listening to this would probably make it happen, adding not much burden to himself about finding a partner.</p>

<p><strong>BIGBANG&#39;s GD reveals thoughts on marriage</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/g-dragon-to-send-his-music-to-space-rapper-becomes-first-korean-artist-and-second-after-the-beatles-to-join-nasa-project-1381539">G-Dragon</a> was asked about when he plans to get married. &ldquo;I&#39;ll get married when it&#39;s time,&rdquo; he said, repeating his past words about when he was asked about his military enlistment. The host affirmed that it&#39;s truly the correct answer, seeing how he had managed to enlist and get discharged from the military in good health without rushing it.<br />
&ldquo;It&#39;s a world that I&rsquo;ve never been to and really want to go to, so I get excited thinking about it,&rdquo; he added when asked about how he was glowing the most while talking about his marriage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most unknown territory for me at this point in my life.</p>

<p>So far, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bigbang-to-disband-soon-g-dragon-reacts-to-speculations-on-good-day-preview-i-came-back-1375476">BIGBANG</a> group mate <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bigbang-reunion-g-dragon-and-taeyang-make-special-appearances-at-daesungs-solo-ds-wave-2025-asia-concert-1384779">Taeyang</a> has gotten married to longtime girlfriend Min Hyo Rin, and the two have also welcomed their first child. Addressing how he felt on experiencing that GD shared, &ldquo;Seeing our members, how Taeyang got married, and the kid&rsquo;s father is my friend. When I met him, seeing myself introduce [myself] to his son, &#39;Hello kid, I&#39;m your dad&#39;s friend&#39; is so fascinating. So I&rsquo;m hoping it would happen to me sometime as well.&rdquo; The singer expressed anticipation of it and worry for the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He ended his imagination with, &ldquo;I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s gonna be my future partner, but anyway, know that I want to get married. If I say this, then someone will eventually come to me, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

YG Entertainment responds to rumors of December cancelation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-11/421330598_blackpink.webp"></img><p>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s long-awaited comeback has an update, and we&rsquo;re not sure if you were waiting for this one after all. According to a Star Today report on November 6, the girl group&rsquo;s comeback has been postponed to January 2026. This news comes in the middle of questions about a possible new album being released in November or December 2025. YG Entertainment has reacted to the news, sharing that the exact dates will be announced later, while the album remains in the final stages of preparation at the moment, their vague stance has been a constant this year.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK eyes a comeback next year with new music</strong><br />
Previous reports claimed that a mini album was in the making, set for a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">November drop</a>. However, later the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-drop-full-length-album-in-december-not-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-reports-1397743">schedule was changed to December</a>, citing quality and a full-length album release instead. Now, it seems that BLACKPINK will release no more new music this year and stick to their ongoing DEADLINE world tour instead. Responding to the reports of the January release plan, YG Entertainment said as per Newsen, &ldquo;The album is in the final stages of being musically perfected. We will share good news through official promotions as soon as preparations are complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while the label has not officially confirmed anything, many have taken this response as the sign they needed that the album has indeed been postponed. The exact reasons for the postponement are unknown, but it seems that the girls need more time amid an ongoing global tour, which is set to end in January 2026, but rumors claim it will be extended through the next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the management label confirmed that the group had filmed the music video already and is doing the rest of the work on the record. Meanwhile, the album will be the team&rsquo;s first in over 3 years and follows the release of their single <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jump-music-video-broke-the-internet-know-how-they-gained-more-likes-than-views-on-youtube-1393540">JUMP</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

On November 5, it was announced that the star has joined Blitzway Entertainment for the complete management of his acting, solo singing career, and involvement in EXO group activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Doh Kyung Soo signs with new agency</strong><br />
His new label&rsquo;s CEO shared with MK Sports, &ldquo;We are very pleased to work with Doh Kyung Soo, a global artist who has been loved by K-pop fans around the world and an actor recognized for his talent both in Korea and abroad. Through our newly established music management system, we will fully support not only Doh Kyung Soo&rsquo;s acting career but also his group and solo music activities,&rdquo; reaffirming the plans for full-fledged artist management. Other artists under the Blitzway Entertainment roster include Ju Ji Hoon, Chun Woo Hee, Jung Ryeo Won, Moon Chae Won, Woo Do Hwan, Kwak Dong Yeon, Yoon Bak, Kim Woo Seok, Chae Jong Hyeop, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is believed that the singer-actor continues to have a 50 per cent stake in his former agency Company Soosoo, which he established with a former manager from SM Entertainment.</p>

As An Yo Han, Doh Kyung Soo will take on his first-ever negative role, playing a man who orchestrates a devious plan against an ordinary worker, Kang Tae Joong, and puts him behind bars. He will have to fight off all attempts to be taken down as Ji Chang Wook presents his hunger for revenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, it was announced that Doh Kyung Soo will be a part of EXO&rsquo;s upcoming <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">fan meeting</a> on December 14, as well as the team&rsquo;s preparations and release of a full-length album in the first quarter of 2026.&nbsp;</p>

Yesterday, during a livestream, Jungkook expressed his wish to go on a solo tour while watching the teaser for member J-Hope&rsquo;s concert movie. He sighed, and fans immediately demanded that BIGHIT MUSIC plan something for the singer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much in line, they&rsquo;ve begun guessing that a solo concert or tour could very well be in the works for the 28-year-old. However, this announcement seems unrelated to their wishes. It remains to be seen what HYBE India has in store for the BTS ARMY in the country, right after announcing its entry.&nbsp;</p>

His other appearances on the chart include On The Street at No. 60, MONA LISA at 65, Sweet Dreams at 66, and LV Bag at 83, all with the exception of the J.Cole collaboration happening in 2025, which took place in 2023 pre-military for him.

It was announced on the same day on their social media accounts that the members and YY Entertainment had ended their relationship with mutual agreement. TOZ comprised of Anthonny, Hart, Yuto, and Takuto, who were formed after the end of Boys Planet, as each one of them was eliminated and unable to be a part of the final lineup, which birthed ZEROBASEONE. Here&rsquo;s how the announcement of their disbandment was made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,<br />
This is YY Entertainment.<br />
After long and careful discussions regarding TOZ&rsquo;s current situation and future, we have mutually agreed to conclude TOZ&rsquo;s group activities.<br />
We sincerely apologize for the sudden news and for causing concern to fans.<br />
We are deeply grateful for the passion and dedication the members of TOZ have shown throughout our journey together.<br />
We kindly ask for your continued warm support and encouragement as each member embarks on a new beginning.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, K-pop boy group OnlyOneOf, which debuted in 2019 and has continued to impress with the concepts and presence, decided not to renew their contracts with their agency, 8D Entertainment. While initially there were suspicions that the group had also disbanded and would be ending their tenure as a team, going their separate ways, member Mill reassured their fans that OnlyOneOf was not going anywhere and would return to them. Initially a seven-piece band, Love left in 2021, with KB going independent in August 2025. Rie, Yoojung, Junji, Mill, and Nine are the remaining members, with KB&rsquo;s future in the team unknown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.<br />
This is 8D Entertainment.<br />
We are letting you know that our management of OnlyOneOf has come to an end.<br />
We would like to sincerely thank the lyOn (OnlyOneof&rsquo;s fans) who have supported the artists with their unchanging love for a long time.<br />
Although OnlyOneOf&rsquo;s activities as a group have ended, we ask that you warmly keep an eye on each member&rsquo;s new start and give them lots of support and encouragement in the future.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

Having enlisted for his mandatory national duty on July 28, 2025, he has <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/astros-cha-eun-woo-gets-caught-by-senior-soldier-for-hiding-this-during-military-meal-what-is-in-your-pockets-1396593">been in the headlines</a> for his &lsquo;face genius&rsquo; presence even at his training base. This time, however, he has more to credit as the singer and actor has been chosen to become the host of the APEC Summit Welcome Dinner Cultural Performance at Lahan Select Hotel&rsquo;s Grand Ballroom in Gyeongju. He was spotted making his way to the event on October 30, and his charming personality even left the industrialists and reporters stunned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cha Eun Woo gets a special invite to be the host of a business event</strong></p>

<p>While uncommon for an active duty soldier to be a part of a business event during his service, it was reported by News1 that the government&rsquo;s APEC Summit Preparatory Planning Committee sent an official document to the Ministry of National Defense in early October to inquire whether Cha Eun Woo could appear as the host of the event. It is said that the Ministry of National Defense approved the request according to the relevant regulations, citing the promotion of national interests and civil-military cooperation as the reason for allowing him to participate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is known that BIGBANG leader G-Dragon will be performing as a special guest at the same ceremony, said to be in the presence of world leaders. Previously, BTS member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/rm-compares-k-pop-to-korean-dish-bibimbap-says-he-was-lucky-to-meet-bts-and-army-we-sang-on-streets-1398061">RM appeared at the summit</a> as the first-ever K-pop star, where he was seated alongside policymakers and executives of some of the biggest companies. He urged businessmen, as a creator himself, to help promote and provide opportunities for their growth. His keynote speech marked a highlight of the evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cha Eun Woo has long been praised for his handsome visuals even during the military and continues to do some side quests, including the release of a movie, a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/watch-astros-cha-eun-woo-unveils-teaser-for-his-dark-and-emotional-solo-album-else-1397947">new album</a>, a K-drama, and more.&nbsp;</p>

As of October 31, the fans of the famed K-pop boy group <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-group-members-1365104">EXO</a> have officially sold out all the seats for their upcoming fan meeting in December. Previously, it was announced that six members of the team would be participating in their promotions starting this year-end, when they will finally reunite with their fandom. Members <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-express-wish-to-promote-with-exo-amid-album-news-made-efforts-to-promote-as-full-group-1398066">Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin</a> were left out of the announcement, and a statement war ensued between the two sides. Now, despite earlier concerns, the tickets for EXO&rsquo;verse, scheduled for December 14, 2025, at 2 pm and 7 pm, have all been sold out.</p>

<p>The fan club pre-sale for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">EXO&rsquo;verse</a> began on October 30, and shortly after, it went out of stock! To be held at the Inspire Arena in Incheon, SM Entertainment confirmed the sold-out status of the fan meeting on October 31. The last such event held by the group was the ONE fan meeting held in April 2024. This time, Chinese member Lay has gladly joined the group celebrations and also plans to be a part of the upcoming comeback, their first in many years as a team.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin try to get included in EXO&rsquo;s plans</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dispute with EXO-CBX unit members Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin is continuing, with both sides not claiming responsibility for the lack of involvement in the concert and album prep. INB100, the trio&rsquo;s new agency, continues to claim that they have emptied all schedules for the artists in December, to facilitate their participation in EXO promotions. Meanwhile, SM Entertainment has claimed that the three have broken trust and hurt the other members as well as fans, while also not paying their 10% dues according to their contract with the agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the intent to join the project, as well as the practical difficulties that stand in the way of the three, many fans are worried about the possibility of them being a part of the 2026 first-quarter album.&nbsp;</p>

Previously, the trio&rsquo;s agency shared that they were surprised to learn about the upcoming fan meeting and album plans by the group, which would exclude the EXO-CBX members. And although they have expressed their wish to promote as a part of the group and cleared their December schedules, they were not included in the activities.</p>

<p>On October 29, SM Entertainment responded to INB100&rsquo;s statement, which claimed that they had agreed to all conditions stated by the former for Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin&rsquo;s participation in year-end promotions and a new album. The former shared its stance that it had requested the trio pay 10 percent of their revenue from individual activities as per their initial contract, but had yet to receive it. Moreover, it claimed that the many &ldquo;unreasonable lawsuits have not only significantly destroyed trust between our two sides, but have also caused great harm to the group EXO and wounded both the fans and the members. Therefore, it was only natural that the trio should first fulfill the terms of the existing agreement and demonstrate a sincere effort to restore trust.&ldquo;</p>

<p>SM Entertainment&rsquo;s side continues to claim that due to the unfulfilled contractual dues and broken trust, they find it deeply regrettable that CBX&rsquo;s side tried to &lsquo;distort the truth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, a new statement has been shared by the trio&rsquo;s agency, INB100, refuting their former management&rsquo;s stance. They relayed that the unit wishes to pay 10% of revenue; however, they would like to wait till the end of their lawsuit is reached. As for the &lsquo;wounds&rsquo; caused to EXO, they intend to be part of the upcoming group promotions, &ldquo;All discussions proceeded on the premise of &#39;EXO full-group activities.&rsquo; CBX made clear their intent to perform the existing agreement, were communicating directly with the members, and have been striving to be together as part of the group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin continue to be in a stalemate position with SM Entertainment, and it is not yet known whether they will participate in the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">EXO&rsquo;verse fan meeting</a> or the 2026 first quarter comeback.</p>

Amid the dispute over the validity of their contracts and their promotions with the team, a new announcement affirming their absence from an upcoming album and fan meeting was shared by SM Entertainment. Now, their new label INB100 has shared their stance, denying the rumors of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusive-xiumin-chen-on-first-snow-challenge-with-baekhyun-what-they-knew-about-india-message-for-exo-ls-and-more-1368070">Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin</a>&rsquo;s refusal to participate in the projects and expressing willingness to be a part of the group activities starting this December.</p>

<p><strong>EXO&#39;s&nbsp;Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin wish to promote with the group for the 2026 album and upcoming fan meeting</strong></p>

<p>On October 29, INB100 shared a detailed statement recounting their attempts to have Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin promote with the rest of the six EXO members. Earlier, an announcement from their former agency shared that only <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">Suho, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, Sehun, and Lay</a> would be a part of the upcoming fan meet called EXO&lsquo;verse, as well as an album which will be released in the first quarter of 2026. The obscurity on CBX&rsquo;s future with the team comes amid the label and the trio&rsquo;s legal fight over contracts, settlements, signing witha&nbsp; new label, and more issues following their departure from SM Entertainment.</p>

<p>In their statement INB100 claimed that, &ldquo;Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin promised fans that, as members of EXO, they would take part in full-group activities, and we have been making every possible effort to honor that promise.&rdquo; They then detailed instances throughout the year where the agency attempted to sort out the matters with their former label. The following are the steps taken according to a report from Newsen.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>July 9, 2025 &mdash; First confirmation of intent to reach an agreement with SM Entertainment. We met directly with SM to confirm the direction and willingness for an agreement over EXO&rsquo;s full-group promotions.</li>
	<li>September 10, 2025 &mdash; Mutual sharing of specific terms. Both sides entered the stage of practical negotiations and exchanged specific agreement details.</li>
	<li>Full acceptance of SM&rsquo;s demands. After the second mediation date (October 2), EXO-CBX clearly communicated their intention to reach an agreement by accepting all of SM&#39;s conditions for EXO&#39;s full-group comeback at the end of the year.</li>
	<li>Schedule adjustments prioritizing EXO activities In order to promote as a full group, they cleared all of their personal schedules in December and waited for SM&#39;s final response through their legal representatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>They added that while making the above efforts for EXO-CBX&#39;s promotions, they received an announcement regarding the holding of an EXO fan meeting and the release of a full album, which excluded EXO-CBX. Moreover, the statement revealed that the three have &lsquo;valued the sincerity of their long-time fans&rsquo; and wish for full-group activities, hence choosing the path of agreement, hoping to reach one as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether SM Entertainment is willing to negotiate any terms for the possibility of having Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin promote with the group.</p>

Speaking to a room full of industrialists and policy makers. Yet again, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-goes-namjooning-post-military-fans-believe-hell-join-jimin-and-jungkook-for-are-you-sure-part-2-1392241">Kim Namjoon</a>&nbsp;impressed with his creative, impactful, and impressive speech, where he likened K-pop to the versatility of Korean food called bibimbap and praised his team&rsquo;s efforts to break down language and cultural barriers. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-go-on-biggest-tour-ever-with-65-stops-including-30-shows-in-north-america-2026-comeback-plans-revealed-1398004">BTS</a> leader&nbsp;also asked for more opportunities for creators like himself to explore and progress in the world, earning applause.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RM cites his fortune for the success of BTS</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#39;m very lucky. I met the six members of BTS, producer &quot;hitman&quot; Bang, who has given me unwavering support so I can focus on the music I want to create, and most importantly, I&#39;ve met ARMY, a global community that embraces our music not as mere entertainment, but as a language of life.&rdquo; He followed up with a shoutout to his fans, which we&rsquo;re sure he greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RM added that the West was wary of the team&rsquo;s art, and BTS&#39;&nbsp;music was categorized as &lsquo;non-English culture,&rsquo; but they decided to take on the challenge of entering mainstream broadcasting platforms. For doing so, the seven members took on a hands-on approach,&nbsp;&ldquo;To create our own opportunities, we even danced and sang on the streets, handing out free concert flyers,&rdquo; but when that wasn&rsquo;t enough, they decided to go deeper and try harder.</p>

<p>He compared the very music his group makes to the traditional Korean dish bibimbap. &ldquo;K-pop embraces Western musical elements like hip-hop, R&amp;B, and EDM without rejecting them, while also fusing them with unique Korean aesthetics, emotions, and production systems. Like bibimbap, these disparate elements, while maintaining their own distinct identities, blend together to create a new result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His visionary take has left a great deal of influence on viewers, as he also asked APEC leaders to provide finances and more opportunities for others like him around the world.&nbsp;</p>

The residential complex is said to be under construction at the moment, with two buildings having five floors underground to seven floors above ground.</p>

<p>The Korean singer seems to be planning well for her future by investing in trustworthy and upscale real estate projects, which would eventually yield her high returns. On the other hand, she continues to expand her music and acting career, going on a world tour with teammates Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-10/610630225_lisa-tangled.webp"></img><p>Lisa may be eyeing her big Hollywood break next! The Thai singer, rapper, dancer, and actor has been making waves thanks to her big moves in the entertainment industry. Every week, she&rsquo;s out there pulling out new stops to make her name spread more far and wide than anyone had expected, and this time around, she may become the latest big Disney star. According to insiders, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-drop-full-length-album-in-december-not-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-reports-1397743">BLACKPINK</a> member is in talks to become Rapunzel, the beloved princess who&rsquo;s the face of the animated film Tangled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa in the race for Rapunzel&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Making her acting debut with The White Lotus Season 3, where she embodied the sly hotelier Mook, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lisa-picks-debut-korean-acting-project-blackpink-star-joins-ma-dong-seok-and-lee-jin-wook-in-extraction-tigo-1397712">Lisa</a> seems to be onto her next project. She is reportedly being considered for the role of Rapunzel in the highly awaited live-action adaptation of the Disney film Tangled. After facing trouble in finding success with their Snow White remake starring Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, the studio seems to be aiming for a high-profile lead star who would bring them the revenue and the eyeballs, and Lisa seems to be the perfect pick for it.</p>

<p>If true, acting in the Tangled adaptation would skyrocket her already sparkling career, and make the BLACKPINK singer one of the most famed stars among her peers&mdash; if she wasn&rsquo;t already. According to an update from a Hollywood casting insider, several names are being screened for the role of Rapunzel, including Sarah Catherine Hook, Aimee Lou Wood, Charlotte Le Bon, Sydney Sweeney, and Lisa. Previously, the reports about a star from The White Lotus universe were being discussed, but online users have zeroed in on it being Lisa, if not Aimee Loud Wood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, the production has not commented on the possibility and has neither confirmed the live-action after indefinitely postponing it earlier this year. Another report previously claimed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-scarlett-johansson-joining-tangled-live-action-find-out-as-film-talks-proceed-at-disney-1397606">Scarlett Johansson</a> was picked for the role of Mother Gothel, the evil woman who imprisons Rapunzel in a tower.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS plans new tour with 65 concert dates</strong><br />
Following the cancellation of their massive Map of the Soul tour due to the pandemic, and a brief Permission to Dance Tour covering only a few cities globally, RM, Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook seem to be hungry for much more. The latest reports suggest that the team is planning 65 concerts around the world next year. More than 30 of the world tour concerts will be held in North America, according to these rumors.</p>

<p>All seven BTS members have now been discharged from the military and completed all their national obligations, making it possible for them to plan bigger and better than ever. Meanwhile, responding to the reports as per TV Chosun, their management agency BIGHIT MUSIC has said, &quot;The schedule and scale of the new world tour have not been decided yet.&quot;</p>

<p>Previously, leader RM confirmed that the new album will be released in March 2026, after the group had teased a spring drop for their record. The last time all seven of them performed together was a free show titled BTS Yet to Come concert in Busan, South Korea, on October 15, 2022. It attracted about 50 million viewers worldwide, proving the impressive global scale of the team. Their last tour gig was in Las Vegas in April 2022, which is said to have amounted to a whopping 25.8 billion KRW (approximately 18 million USD).&nbsp;</p>

And while her personal life continues to be intriguing to fans and admirers, she remains private. Her latest release may, however, hint at the status of her romantic relationship. Called Good Goodbye, the song talks about a clean and acceptable break-up, speaking about which recently, Hwasa agreed with the saying that sometimes separating might be in the best interest of those involved. This has now raised suspicions that the songstress has separated from her longtime partner, a businessman 12 years her senior.</p>

<p><strong>MAMAMOO&#39;s Hwasa hints at a possible breakup</strong></p>

While the identity of the man continued to be a well-kept secret, the current condition of their relationship has seemingly been revealed by the star. Her agency denied commenting on her dating rumors, sharing that it was her private life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appearing on SBS PowerFM&rsquo;s Cultwo Show, she spoke about her latest song Good Goodbye starring Park Jung Min. &ldquo;When I first wrote the song, many people asked me, &lsquo;Can a good goodbye even exist? I&rsquo;ve never experienced one, so I don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo; But after releasing it, a lot of listeners said they could receive the message positively, even if they haven&rsquo;t personally experienced a good goodbye.&rdquo; She added that it has made her proud of her music.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On being asked whether good goodbyes exist in real life and if she had ever experienced it herself, the singer, disagreeing with the other guest, shared that, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s possible [to have clean breakups].&rdquo; When the host shared that &lsquo;breaking up might be for the best&rsquo; in cases where, despite love, there&rsquo;s stress, Hwasa reacted with a small &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and ended up laughing out loud, cheering for the response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, during her appearance on Park Na Rae&rsquo;s YouTube show Na Rae Sik with Han Hye Jin, she had added how all three of them were &lsquo;single&rsquo;, hinting at her breakup.</p>

<p>Among these, the most shocking name appears to be Mumbai, India, a country that is often ignored by K-pop companies for regular touring. But, BTS has repeatedly expressed their wish to perform in the country and even revealed that the stop was a part of their Map of the Soul Tour, which was supposed to be held from April 2020 through to the next year and was touted to be one of their biggest so far. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the tour cancellation and, thereby, no performance from BTS could be conducted.</p>

<p>Moreover, HYBE recently established its <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hybe-launches-in-india-bts-agency-expands-with-plans-to-target-1-4-billion-market-via-mumbai-office-1397122">overseas headquarters in Mumbai</a>, raising expectations for its roster to perform in the country and build its K-pop system. All these happenings and rumors combined have made it seem that a BTS India concert may not just be a pipe dream anymore. &nbsp;</p>

Having completed their plans for the day, the bunch moved on to grab a quick bite to satiate themselves after a rigorous routine. There, the OP who took the image claimed that V and Song Kang were joined by fellow actor Kim Young Dae and Jaehyun. Among these, only the NCT member is currently serving in the militar,y while the No Gain No Love star is likely to enlist sometime soon. The other two have already wrapped up their own national duties recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the identities of the two celebrities was not confirmed, we wonder how this relationship came to be. They&rsquo;re all a year apart with Song Kang being the oldest and Jaehyun being the youngest. Moreover, the NCT singer is friends with fellow 1997 liner <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-fans-for-ignoring-him-while-running-10-km-at-han-river-and-doing-bangtan-gesture-know-what-happened-1397192">Jungkook from BTS</a>, which is where their relationship may have begun. It is not known how Kim Young Dae came to join them and if it was him after all. Whatever the case, we hope to see them together more often!</p>

A giant ring made of glass was presented to the bride, who is said to have tossed a bouquet of broccoli and not flowers to add the fun element to her ceremony.</p>

<p>The two stars have been together for about 6 years now, after rumors first began in 2020. Xu Yiyang was an SM Rookie and met her agency senior, Huang Zitao, at SM Entertainment first in 2015. They continued to date secretly for a while before finally confirming their relationship in 2023. The two registered their marriage earlier this year and announced their plans to have a grandiose celebration with their fans in online attendance. The livestream covering their wedding ceremony is said to have been viewed about 17 million times on the Chinese social media platform Douyin (TikTok).</p>

CNBLUE member and Sell Your Haunted House star responds to rumors]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-10/169943843_jung-yong-hwa.webp"></img><p>Rumors and K-pop go hand in hand. It&rsquo;s no secret that marriage reports spring out from anywhere and everywhere these days, and the latest victim of this train is singer and actor Jung Yong Hwa. On October 15, an online post gained a lot of traction for being about the star&rsquo;s personal life. Not to be worried, the OP only claimed that the actor was getting married&mdash; next year! With no news of him dating out in the recent days and his apparent single status, this post left his fans reeling and demanding answers. In true Jung Yong Hwa manner, the actor revealed that it was all lies and he has no such plans as of now.</p>

<p><strong>Jung Yong Hwa reveals if he has marriage plans in 2026</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard from a friend that Jung Yong Hwa is getting married next year,&ldquo; read the post on an online community platform. Soon after, the 36-year-old revealed his plans and confirmed that it was all but a baseless rumor. During a livestream where the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/cnblue-reacts-to-surprise-appearance-of-controversial-ex-member-lee-jong-hyun-during-15th-anniversary-live-watch-1367811">CNBLUE</a> member&nbsp;was communicating with his fans on Wednesday, the singer shared, &ldquo;Usually, next year&#39;s schedule comes up by June. At this point, my calendar for next year is already packed [with work]. I don&rsquo;t see a &lsquo;wedding&rsquo; on there.&rdquo; Continuing with a laugh, he added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no wedding on the schedule―so please stop DMing me about it. It felt odd to even reply, so I stayed quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He completely shut down any questions about his nuptials and clarified that nothing of the sort was happening next year. Moreover, he reaffirmed that he was busy with his work in the coming year and would be focusing on it. It seems that he was getting a lot of fans&rsquo; messages about the same as he chose to reply to them once and for all. His lighthearted but stern response silenced any naysayers.&nbsp;</p>

YG Entertainment reacts to reports]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-10/1955674771_blackpink.webp"></img><p>BLACKPINK is dropping new music soon! Although it&rsquo;s later than fans expected. Reports have surfaced claiming that the four-piece will be dropping a studio album at the end of the year and not next month. Responding to the claims, YG Entertainment has shared that it plans on announcing the schedule to the fans of the girl group in due time. However, they have maintained the stance that the plans were not set as of now, despite there being under two months from the reported dates.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s comeback date moves ahead by a month</strong></p>

<p>According to an Xports News report on October 16, the members of BLACKPINK are preparing a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">new album</a> with the goal of releasing it in December. However, unlike what was previously believed, the group will be releasing a full-length one and not a mini-album. Earlier this year, it was announced that the K-pop stars would be releasing it in November and not at the end of the year. Now, the approximate date for the release has been revealed as mid-December, pushing it ahead by at least a month from the original plan announced by Yang Hyun Suk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing has been decided regarding the group&rsquo;s comeback,&rdquo; said YG Entertainment about the reported schedule to Maeil Kyungjae. A surprise drop is expected as Jisoo, Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa gear up for the revelation of their first group record in over three years following the release of BORN PINK in 2022. They dropped a single named <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jump-debuts-at-no-28-on-billboard-hot-100-know-ateezs-career-high-score-with-in-your-fantasy-1394262">JUMP</a> earlier this year and received a positive response from millions of fans around the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The girls of BLACKPINK were previously expected to showcase their new songs at the second half of the DEADLINE World Tour. They will resume their concerts in Kaohsiung in a couple of days, after 2 months of rest to work on their album. Recently, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-adds-2-shows-to-deadline-world-tour-across-singapore-and-hong-kong-know-new-schedule-1397004">2 dates have been added</a> to their planned show schedule, with the tour now ending on January 26, 2026. An entire Asian leg of the tour will follow the team, with fans raising expectations for more global gigs being added eventually.</p>

Making their historic debut on the runway, the girls of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/twice-to-headline-lollapalooza-2025-with-boynextdoor-xdinary-heroes-katseye-and-more-among-performers-1378106">TWICE</a> became the first-ever K-pop group to perform at the famed event in New York City. Members Jihyo, Nayeon, Momo, and Tzuyu were chosen to represent the original 9-piece team. They walked the pink carpet ahead of the show and then went in to present a fantastic performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TWICE impressed the audience with their performance of their songs Startegy and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/this-is-for-music-video-twice-drops-women-empowerment-anthem-for-latest-comeback-watch-1393449">This Is For</a>, a fun pop number and a power-up anthem for the all-female show, displaying an apt pick of tracks for their first gig on the runway. The members were dressed in intricate two looks for the night, including one carpet appropriate and another lingerie moment on the stage, complete with furry boots. The girls danced along while singing as models strutted past them in extravagant wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Performers of the evening included Missy Elliott, Karol G, and Madison Beer, alongside the four members of TWICE, making for another all-female lineup. Last year, BLACKPINK member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2024-supermodels-gigi-hadid-bella-hadid-and-blackpink-lisas-iconic-looks-decoded-1353762">Lisa became the first-ever K-pop idol</a> to take to the mic at the fashion event and slayed with her splendid performance.</p>

<p><strong>TWICE&rsquo;s Tzuyu reveals the condition of her throat leading to a shaky voice</strong><br />
This time, despite earning cheers from the crowd, member Tzuyu seemed unsatisfied with her outcome at the style show and took to personal messaging platform to apologize to her fans. She wrote, &ldquo;ONCE, I&rsquo;m sorry. Before coming to New York, I warmed up my throat with a vocal coach, but after arriving, my throat got worse. My voice was still good during the rehearsals, but it got bad during the actual performance and the voice wouldn&rsquo;t come out because I had phlegm in my throat. So even though I had honey tea and did a lot of things [it did not help] I&rsquo;ll definitely show you a better performance next time!&rdquo;</p>

Every brand that she collaborates with goes viral and gets an instant influx of dedicated followers and buyers. So it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the star releases something of her own. And it seems that the fans&rsquo; long-running demand is finally coming to light. Recently, reports of the Like JENNIE hitmaker working on launching her own makeup products have gained traction on the internet. However, the singer is yet to address any such claims or make any announcements about a personal collection.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie to take on the world of cosmetics? Here&rsquo;s what we know</strong></p>

<p>Jennie is making waves for her music and fashion alike. One of the most coveted faces in the K-pop and global marketing world, she challenges headlines with each step. With her recent collaborations with a tumbler brand going big and her move away from Gentle Monster after years of ties, many rumors have been floating around. Moreover, her latest exit from Hera, which then brought in Stray Kids&rsquo; Felix, has raised suspicions of something personal brewing.</p>

<p>Now, it seems that she may as well reveal her own makeup line following her drop from the high-quality and contemporary Seoul-based brand. It should not come as a surprise to anyone, as fans have long been demanding she do something of her own. Insiders have long speculated, especially since 2024, that the singer and actress may as well start her own cosmetics line sometime soon. Her appearances at countless fashion shows, including the latest one for Chanel, have once again solidified her presence in the style department.</p>

<p>With the rumors, fans have also shared that anything created by the Solo queen would get sold out instantly, and are expressing growing interest in the possibility. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jisoo-and-zayn-malik-promise-to-love-with-their-eyes-closed-in-new-collab-music-video-explained-1397591">BLACKPINK</a> is gearing up for a mini-album release, eyeing a November drop.</p>

The SEVEN hitmaker soon bounced off the livestream, asking him to do well and apologized to SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s fans for his sudden visit. However, his next words elicited a funny response in both fandoms, and Jungkook wrote, &ldquo;Love you dude,&rdquo; making Mingyu laugh out loud and ask to hang out whenever possible, as well as do a livestream together.</p>

<p>The two, along with GOT7&rsquo;s BamBam and Yugyeom, fellow SEVENTEEN members DK and The 8, NCT&rsquo;s Jaehyun, ASTRO&rsquo;s Cha Eun Woo, and sometimes even Stray Kids&rsquo; Bang Chan, make for the most powerful bunch of friends in K-pop, called the &lsquo;97 liners, comprising singers born in 1997.</p>

Boy group <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/enhypen-drops-seductive-digital-single-loose-ahead-of-coachella-set-leaves-fans-heart-racing-1380645">ENHYPEN</a> has been at the receiving side of this privacy breakdown on multiple occasions, and during one recent such occasion, member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/enhypens-jays-fans-wonder-if-he-was-forced-to-dance-with-katseyes-daniela-know-why-1385534">Jay</a> took matters into his own hands by calling out a person who had been troubling him by giving a call on his personal phone while the star was on a live session with ENGENE on the fan communication platform, Weverse. He advised them against continuing it and revealed what he would do if it did not stop soon.</p>

<p><strong>ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Jay gets irritated by sasaeng fan during livestream</strong></p>

<p>During a livestream on October 10, Jay from ENHYPEN was soon treated unkindly by a person who was continuously calling him. Right from the start, he was bothered because of the unrelenting calls and decided to bash them in front of the thousands watching him. He revealed that the person was targeting his own phone and that the stream was working on the company&rsquo;s device and so it was not directly interfering with his live session, but he was getting distracted by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite canceling the call many times, it continued, so he addressed it with a strict tone, directly talking to the perpetrator. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still watching this, right? I don&#39;t know who you are, and I even don&#39;t care about you, but if you keep calling me like this, it&#39;s really bothering me, and it&#39;s really annoying to do my communication with my fans, and you already waste my 10 minutes that I can communicate with my fans during my live[stream] so congratulations if you got what you want.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He warned the caller of immediate consequences in a stern tone soon after. &ldquo;But yeah, if you keep doing this, I&#39;ll pick up your call and put it on a speakerphone. Run it out in my live[stream], so if you want that, keep doing that, okay? Okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After apologizing to his fans for the strange happening right from the get-go, he added that he did not want such an unpleasant event to dissuade him and continued to speak with them.&nbsp;</p>

The fan who took revenge for the singer was lauded by others as they were also heard asking why she would do that to him, and asked her to go to the police station.

The BTS member stays true to his nature always and knows how to keep those around him happy. Two of his collaborators on his solo albums, Red Velvet&rsquo;s Wendy and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jin-to-kick-off-solo-concerts-with-choi-ye-na-as-special-guest-heres-what-to-expect-from-runseokjin_ep-tour-1392350">Choi Yena</a>, shared about their time together with the star and lauded him. On October 9, Wendy appeared on SBS PowerFM&rsquo;s 2 O&rsquo;Clock Escape Cultwo Show; meanwhile, on the same day, Choi Yena sang his praises on MBC&rsquo;s Radio Star.</p>

<p><strong>Red Velvet&rsquo;s Wendy and Choi Yena reveal Jin&rsquo;s true self away from the cameras</strong><br />
Wendy spoke about her experience working with the oldest member from BTS on their collaboration song, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/watch-bts-jin-and-red-velvets-wendy-sing-hearts-on-the-window-live-at-happy-special-stage-share-sweet-senior-junior-moment-1358683">Heart on the Window</a>, as well as his appearance on her radio show, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/echo-bts-jin-to-reunite-with-red-velvets-wendy-for-first-radio-show-appearance-since-military-discharge-1387236">Wendy&rsquo;s Youngstreet</a>. &ldquo;Jin made a promise to be loyal. He promised that if he ever appeared on a radio show, he would appear on mine. Since I participated in a song as a featured artist, he said he would definitely come. He told his company in advance and had them put it into his schedule. Before I could even ask, they said, &lsquo;Wendy, he has decided to appear.&rsquo; I was so thankful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She recalled receiving a call to join him for a feature on his solo album. &ldquo;I was wondering why they chose me [for Loser collaboration] and listened to the song. But the moment I heard the song, I realized, &lsquo;Ah! This song is totally my style.&rsquo; I felt confident that I could pull it off. So with that confidence, I told him I&#39;d definitely do it. It became a great opportunity for me having join him on the track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She revealed being invited to his solo concert as a guest. &ldquo;The part where I truly felt that [he was] a world-class figure was when, even just for breakfast, they grilled thinly sliced samgyeopsal (pork belly) so deliciously. I could also freely choose whichever Jin ramen flavor I wanted, from mild or spicy. I remember very vividly how delicious it was.&rdquo; She appreciated the fans&rsquo; reactions to their performance and how big the stage was, but the quality of food made her admit his world-class stature.</p>

On September 8, the three were suddenly spotted at the Incheon International Airport by sasaeng fans who leaked their whereabouts. Soon after landing, they were mobbed by hordes of people on their arrival in China. Unaware of the situation, the three singers were caught off guard and had to deal with the mess on their own without the security of any bodyguards. Many even stalked them to their hotel and threw phones at them.</p>

<p><strong>Soobin fights back against rude fans in China</strong><br />
After getting some days off from their busy schedules, the friend group comprising Soobin, Zhang Hao, and Keonhee headed off to China to rest a little, away from the following eyes and lenses in South Korea. However, their location was leaked to many, which resulted in them being followed around and even being swarmed at the airport. The three who were unprepared for the masses flocking around them were surprised and tried their best to evade them, walking through tens of fans. They had no bodyguards with them, as it was a private schedule meant to be enjoyed with friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, they managed to get some security who joined them at the hotel. Letting them walk into an elevator by blocking others, the three singers entered one by one, but they were treated rudely as a fan threw their phone at them. Shocked by it, the bodyguards waved their hands no and then tried to stop any more such instances. Soobin, who seemed taken aback, took hold of the phone lying in front of them and threw it back with force. Another phone came flying back in, it was thrown back out, and the surprised face of the personnel was seen in clips shared by onlookers.</p>

Previously, having been called out for his misogynistic lyrics, the rapper took time to consult female professors, apologizing for his oversight and promising to do better. He has taken it upon himself to learn and develop his opinions. Recently, during a livestream on the fan communication platform Weverse, the leader of the team shared his views on how the world forces people, especially women, to live a certain way and denounced the practice of willfully choosing their lives. His words are earning a lot of attention domestically and internationally for his progressive take.</p>

<p><strong>RM shares honest opinions on marriage and love</strong><br />
The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-cant-remember-how-he-built-k-pop-life-for-12-years-expresses-difficulty-in-fitting-back-post-military-1391346">BTS</a> member is always truthful about his idea of starting a family. He even spoke about wanting a kid in his life, a topic many K-pop stars usually avoid for fear of being cancelled. But RM&rsquo;s honesty has resonated with people who appreciate him speaking openly about something so natural. His livestream on October 5 was on the same note and has received a lot of praise for his kindness-filled choice of words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it comes to marriage, people feel rushed and pressured. There are realistic parts too. Especially for women, it seems like society and the media keep putting pressure on them. On all of us, really. I just wish people could live in their own way. There&rsquo;s no right answer.&rdquo; He added that if he gets married too early, his fans would get sad, but his living this way may just end up putting him off the concept altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing about how he grew up watching his own parents build a family. Living just 5 minutes away from each other, RM&rsquo;s mom and dad dated for a long time. At his age, they already had a kid who was 3 years old, so he views them in high regard. &ldquo;Seeing my parents&rsquo; 9 years of dating period, naturally thought I&#39;d get married, but I&#39;m already 32 now... if I get married too soon, you all might feel sad, at this rate, I most probably end up not getting married at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The singer hopes people will live the way they want, and let others do the same. He recently announced his plans to hold an <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-collaborates-with-san-francisco-museum-of-modern-art-to-exhibit-personal-art-collection-from-october-2026-1397393">exhibition at the&nbsp;San Francisco Museum of Modern Art</a> to showcase his personal art collection.</p>

Their starkly different vocal tones will be an interesting addition to their discographies, making for an exciting collaboration.</p>

<p>Recently, during a livestream, the 32-year-old spoke about his upcoming music, &#39;New music coming out soon as well, with another cool collaborator. I&#39;ll be featured on something pretty sick. So that&#39;s coming out first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BLACKPINK is also gearing up to drop a new mini-album, their first in 3 years, amid their annoying DEADLINE World Tour. Previously, Yang Hyun Suk announced that their team is working on a November release.</p>

As per an announcement on October 2, Jin will be holding two shows on October 31 at 7 pm KST and November 1 at 6:30 pm KST, at the Incheon Munhak Main Stadium in Michuhol-gu, Incheon. This has now raised the hotel prices near the stadium, raising problems for the customers who previously booked the slots.</p>

<p><strong>BTS member Jin&rsquo;s RUNSEOKJIN_EP.TOUR increases hotel prices for attendees</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jin-says-solo-tour-makes-him-think-about-bts-members-a-lot-j-hope-v-and-rm-support-with-their-wild-dancing-1394486">Jin</a>&rsquo;s last fan concert, to be held at the famed Incheon Munhak Main Stadium, across 2 days, has invited some trouble for the common non-fans who happened to have booked accommodations near the stadium, as well as the BTS ARMY members who wish to check out spots near the venue for easy commute to the Stadium. Netizens on online communities have begun sharing their experience with one person talking about a sudden cancellation from the hotel&rsquo;s end, alongside a 200% surge in prices when they tried to book it again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My confirmed booking was suddenly canceled over the phone because the site said the price was wrong,&rdquo; shared the OP. They revealed the exact differences in the price range that the customers have been subjected to. &ldquo;During holiday periods, prices usually peak at 80,000 KRW (approximately 57 USD), but they hiked it to 1,075,000 KRW (approximately 765 USD).&rdquo;</p>

<p>With short notice, it is expected that the costs for other accommodations near the stadium will rise further, especially nearer to the date. Moreover, it was announced in the notice on Weverse that the date of the concert may be moved one day further owing to the change in the sports schedule at the stadium. However, BTS&rsquo; Jin&rsquo;s fans are happy that the singer has the opportunity to showcase his talent via these encore concerts, with the star himself sharing that the availability of the venue was made known to him just 3 weeks ago.</p>

The singer has managed to break another record without releasing any new music for a year now. As of September 18, the star has managed to gather a total of 2 billion Spotify streams on his 2024 release, Who. Released on July 19, 2024, as the lead single from his second studio album MUSE, the song has been at the crossroads of many mixed reviews from listeners. An angst-filled song, it runs for 1 minute and 50 seconds with Ghstloop, Tenroc, Pdogg, Jon Bellion, and Pete Nappi stepping in as the songwriters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jimin shows explosive popularity with Who release</strong><br />
After his successful run with FACE, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jimin-makes-the-world-go-delulu-bts-members-influence-pushes-for-new-addition-to-cambride-dictionary-1395845">Jimin</a> dropped MUSE as a surprise for his fans while he was away serving in the military. It debuted at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, a small fall back from the success of his previous release, Like Crazy, which grabbed the top spot, but not much had changed for the singer himself, who still managed a fairly popular drop amid his hiatus. It also made Jimin top the Digital Song Sales chart, giving him his sixth number-one on the list. The next week, it climbed up two spots to reach No. 12, a remarkable feat for a non-promoting song.</p>

<p>Jimin&rsquo;s Who has become the fastest Korean solo artist&rsquo;s song to reach the impressive number. The track managed the feat in just over a year since its release, taking a total of 427 days to do so. Fans have taken to social media to celebrate the achievement and congratulate the singer for it, trending hashtags like &lsquo;Congratulations Jimin&rsquo; and &lsquo;Who 2 Billion&rsquo; to commemorate it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jimin was recently <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jimin-debuts-blonde-look-at-seoul-party-with-rm-amid-song-da-eun-dating-row-fans-suspect-new-song-on-the-way-1396477">spotted with blond hair color</a> during an appearance with fellow BTS member RM at a party.

However, the addition of new dates has played in favor of the possibility that the team would have encore shows to mark the end of their highly awaited return. Additionally, the quartet would also have new songs to perform, bringing a massive change to the second half of the tour, and possibly seeing another round of the West for promoting their new tracks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, no new details have been shared about BLACKPINK&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">upcoming mini-album release</a>.

<p>The song recently gave Ros&eacute; her first solo win at the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/2025-mtv-vmas-full-winners-list-lady-gaga-ariana-grande-blackpinks-rose-grab-major-trophies-1396563">2025 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, being given the prestigious <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-rose-quotes-therapist-after-apts-historic-song-of-the-year-win-at-2025-vmas-not-giving-up-1396567">Song of the Year win</a>. She is also a frontrunner in the Grammy Awards race, with many critics showing her as a strong contender for major categories, including collaboration and record of the year. If nominated, she would become the only one from her team and the first female K-pop star to do so.</p>

The alternative hip hop and pop rock power ballad was released on February 13, 2017, as the You Never Walk Alone album&#39;s lead single. Released as a part of the repackage of the septet&rsquo;s second Korean-language studio album, Wings, which was first dropped in 2016, the track has served as one of the longest-running songs on the MelOn Weekly Chart. However, on September 15, it was reported that the song had exited the list for the first time since its release in 2017.</p>

<p><strong>BTS&rsquo; 2017 track Spring Day ends an impressive stay in the MelOn Weekly Chart</strong><br />
Spring Day has managed to stay in the Top 100 of the MelOn Weekly Chart for 447 consecutive weeks and made it the longest charting song in the platform&#39;s history. It has been one of the most popular songs in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-not-most-popular-celebrity-in-south-korea-surprising-tv-star-takes-over-most-influential-list-1395810">BTS</a>&#39; discography with an impressive track record across music platforms and countries. The song has been acknowledged by the likes of Korean year-end award shows, including the 9th Melon Music Awards, held in 2017, where it was awarded Song of the Year, and at the 32nd Golden Disc Awards in 2018, where it was given the Digital Bonsang win. The latter also saw it being nominated for the Digital Daesang prize, and the 7th Gaon Chart Music Awards gave it a Song of the Year &ndash; February nod.</p>

<p>Spring Day has grabbed 4 music show wins at Show Champion, M Countdown, Music Bank, and Inkigayo, where it won during its second week of release. A remix of Spring Day was released for free via SoundCloud on June 4, 2018, thanks to the popularity of the original. Meanwhile, a Japanese version of the song was dropped on May 10, 2017, as a B-side release of a single album.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Believed to be based on the Sewol Ferry Disaster, BTS has never confirmed the nuances of its tribute to the victims of the tragedy. Leader <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/i-miss-you-bts-rm-thanks-fans-for-massive-birthday-celebrations-debuts-new-hair-color-and-shows-off-cute-cake-1396765">RM</a>&nbsp;previously addressed the rumors, claiming that many interpretations can arise from the song and left it to the discretion of the listeners.</p>

A second court hearing was held on September 11, where the executive producer behind the team stepped forward as a witness in an attempt to plead her case in the &lsquo;put option&rsquo; legal issue against the media giant. Amid many rebuttals on both sides, a report from Chosun Ilbo revealed that the alleged plan to incite music chart manipulation or sajaegi was brought up. It was noted that the idea to accuse two groups in the company was made even before the debut of ILLIT.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>HYBE declares major breach of trust with former ADOR CEO Min Hee Jin</strong><br />
During the trial, the Chief Legal Officer of HYBE, Jung Jin Soo, claimed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/min-hee-jins-plans-of-using-hybes-dirty-secret-and-media-play-to-steal-newjeans-gets-exposed-via-alleged-new-evidence-1390748">Min Hee Jin</a> planned music chart manipulation and a public opinion fight against HYBE girl groups LE SSERAFIM and ILLIT, even before the latter&rsquo;s debut. They have cited the documents of &lsquo;Project 1945&rsquo;, which was found during the audit carried out by HYBE on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ador-rejects-min-hee-jins-reinstatement-hybe-label-says-newjeans-as-employees-have-no-say-in-who-is-ceo-1394527">ADOR</a>, as their base for the argument. February 19 and March 25, which are LE SSERAFIM&rsquo;s comeback (3rd mini-album) and debut days, respectively in 2024, were dug into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, HYBE has accused Min Hee Jin and former Vice President Lee Sang Woo of ideating to get the two teams involved in sajaegi issues from the get-go, believed to have been written on March 2, 2024. Moreover, the agency has alleged that planned attacks like &lsquo;Searching for employee controversy,&rsquo; &lsquo;Investigating communities/ social media,&rsquo; &lsquo;Same concept photos, imitation of New Jeans&rsquo;, and more were their major points of dispute for the public opinion manipulation. A meeting between the ex-CEO and the parents of the girl group&rsquo;s members was held on March 29, 2024, where supposed evidence of plans to use netizens&rsquo; opinions was found.</p>

Her speech from the historic moment, becoming the first K-pop act to win it is being discussed online for the most unexpected reason. The singer gave a shout out to her therapist who keeps reminding her to thank herself for surviving difficult times.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Ros&eacute; wins Song of the Year with Bruno Mars for APT.</strong><br />
Taking the prize from Paris Hilton, Ros&eacute; steadied herself in front of the mic and took out a piece of paper to read off of. &ldquo;I feel like this is a really big moment for myself and a lot of other people. Thank you so much, Bruno [Mars]. I can&rsquo;t believe this. I&rsquo;m gonna call you after, thank you so much for believing in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking in the moment to talk about her journey so far, she added, &ldquo;Someone asked me the other day what my fear in life was and I was quite shocked at my own response. I had no idea how deeply personal this journey had been for me. I told them I feared that somewhere along this journey of pursuing my dreams I might hit a wall and disappoint my 16-year-old self who grew up always an oddball among society, who wished someday she could be herself and pursue her dreams like anyone else I saw on television.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went on to dedicate the award to her 16-year-old self who dreamed and to all those who have watched and supported her growth, allowing her to let go of the imposter syndrome she once seemingly faced. Ros&eacute; thanked her team, her label and fellow BLACKPINK members as well as her dedicated fans for believing in her. Finally she took the time to express gratitude to herself for holding on, &ldquo;As my therapist tells me to do every day, I&rsquo;d like to thank myself for not giving up even in the toughest of times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BLACKPINK, took home the Group of the Year win at the ceremony.</p>

The group and their fans have managed to grab a whopping 2 billion views on the music video for the 2021 track. As of September 4 at approximately 9:16 am KST, the music video crossed over the massive number, achieving a remarkable milestone in its legacy. It has taken Dynamite about 5 years, 13 days, and 20 hours to knock off the 2 billion views number.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamite powers years of success for BTS</strong><br />
Released on August 21, 2020, at 1 pm KST, Dynamite marked the group&rsquo;s first full-English single amid the roaring COVID-19 pandemic back then. With a positive message, the group managed to capture many hearts around the world. The song became an instant hit globally, grabbing them their first-ever Billboard Hot 100 No.1 ranking. Now, half a decade later, the song has become the septet&rsquo;s first-ever music video to cross 2 billion views.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The success of Dynamite was followed by more English-language releases from the group, including Butter and Permission to Dance, which came in May 2021 and July 2021, respectively. With repeated triumphs over Billboard charts and a breakthrough in the West, BTS&rsquo; formula was soon adapted by many.</p>

<p>Since then, the group has dropped another album, Proof, in June 2022 as their last active group release before taking a military hiatus of about 3 years when the team members all enlisted for their mandatory services. A follow-up release, Take Two, was gifted to fans in June 2023, celebrating the 10-year anniversary of their debut. BTS is said to be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/all-7-bts-members-return-to-south-korea-after-completing-album-production-work-in-us-for-2-months-1396195">working on their new album</a> at the moment after reuniting with each other following their military discharge.

The singer also reacted to his solo win at the Korean Broadcasting Awards, thanking everyone for the accolade, which marked the first in 9 years for an individual.

<p>During a recent livestream ahead of his 28th birthday, Jungkook had revealed that during their stay in the USA, the team had focused on production of new songs, rather than working on the recording process. The same is said to happen in South Korea.

March 2026 is said to be the most likely date. The team recently returned after a two-month stay in Los Angeles, where they are said to have collaborated with skilled producers and composers on the songs for their record. During a livestream, Jungkook shared that the team has yet to record and was focusing on the production of the tracks so far.</p>

<p><strong>BTS to work on recording new album and get back to US soon</strong><br />
An industry insider shared, &quot;BTS will soon be filming a music video for their new song in the US. The visual aspects of the new album, including the concept and vibe, have already been finalized, and recording is currently in progress.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is all set to be BTS&#39; first new song in more than three years since their 10th anniversary single, Take Two, released in June 2023. While the comeback seems to be gearing up for March 2026, it is possible that the team will drop a pre-release single before it, as has been the norm for the team for many years now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report also claimed that following the release of a new album next spring, the team will also begin a new world tour. If true, it will be the group&rsquo;s first concert in about four years, since their free Busan show in October 2022, and the end of their BTS PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE in April 2022.</p>

On Thursday, during the early hours of the morning, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-enjoys-rare-la-outing-with-rm-suga-j-hope-jimin-and-v-posing-play-fighting-sans-this-member-1395230">BTS</a> members RM, SUGA, J-Hope and Jungkook were snapped at the Incheon International Airport by paparazzi. The four expressed excitement on their return, thanking the photo journalists who were capturing the moments, and bowed in gratitude. The team is said to resume the rest of their album work back at home.</p>

<p><strong>BTS reunites in South Korea after 2-month-long American escapade</strong></p>

<p>Previously, member Jin was seen at TXT&rsquo;s concert last weekend and then hosting a BIGHIT MUSIC manager&rsquo;s wedding. It was followed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-strikes-for-first-pitch-at-dodger-stadium-decked-in-no-7-jersey-hugs-shohei-ohtani-in-viral-moment-1396091">V&rsquo;s appearance at Dodger Stadium</a> for throwing a fabulous ceremonial first pitch on August 25 local time and his subsequent return to his homeland. Jimin was snapped arriving solo, accompanied by his manager, who carried a Hello Kitty carry-on bag amid his <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jimin-dragged-into-dating-rumor-with-song-da-eun-after-she-shares-private-elevator-video-fans-call-for-action-1396147">ongoing dating controversy</a> linking him to reality TV star and actress Song Da Eun. Now with the return of RM, SUGA, J-Hope and Jungkook, all seven members are back and were reported to continue working on their spring 2026 comeback album in South Korea.</p>

<p>Dressed in casuals, the singers were in high spirits but did not wait to chat or offer updates and were instead seen waving to the cameras. According to reports, including RNX TV and Dispatch Korea, the group will resume their work with expectations of their first post-military comeback at an all-time high. The team stayed in Los Angeles for a couple of months, supposedly working with globally celebrated producers and musicians, including Diplo and Charlie Puth, both of whom they&rsquo;ve worked with in the past.&nbsp;</p>

Speaking to MONSTA X&rsquo;s Shownu and NCT 127&rsquo;s Jungwoo, Stray Kids&#39; <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/stray-kids-bang-chan-will-not-stop-putting-stays-in-their-place-warns-fans-against-rude-actions-you-respect-me-1394877">Bang Chan</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/stray-kids-hyunjins-live-becomes-topic-of-discussion-fans-spot-katseyes-sophia-and-manon-fangirling-1390766">Hyunjin</a> appeared on an episode of their vintage-style food variety show on YouTube, Nopogy. They shared how their latest release has been inspired by Indian music, especially Bollywood, surprising the hosts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How Indian music found its way into Stray Kids&rsquo; newest album Karma</strong><br />
Towards the end of their visit to the program, the Stray Kids members Bang Chan and Hyunjin were asked about their new album, Karma and its lead track, CEREMONY. The leader shared that he personally thinks this comeback is an intoxicating taste, &ldquo;It feels like being tipsy and having fun.&rdquo; Going into the specifics of the genre, the two agreed that it was Bollywood this time, with the screen describing it as a popular type of music in India, which is mostly seen in Hindi language films.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NCT member was taken aback by the unfamiliarity of the music to him, to which Bang Chan, as one of the producers,&nbsp;shared, &ldquo;Yeah, I took inspiration from Indian music and tried it out. Since it had a new kind of color, I really wanted to try.&rdquo; On being asked if it was a unanimous decision by the members or if it involved external push, Bang Chan clarified that, much like all of their working styles before this release, they decided among themselves and thought of trying it out.</p>

<p>They revealed that while listening to the track, they thought of Bollywood in their minds, and having never done it before, they concluded it would be good to attempt it once. Furthermore, Bang Chan spoke about how the title &lsquo;Karma&rsquo; comes to be from consequences and the idea of all efforts and hardship, resulting in good fortune returning to them, making them have a CEREMONY.</p>

On August 22, a new notice on the boy group&rsquo;s Weverse and other social media accounts confirmed the team&rsquo;s decision to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-txt-renew-its-contract-with-bighit-music-members-update-fans-ahead-of-7th-anniversary-the-five-of-us-1394176">renew their contracts with their management label</a>, BIGHIT MUSIC. The group thanked their fans for the support and expressed their wish to go further with them. This makes them the second team from the agency to continue their long-running relationship with their agency, breaking the infamous 7-year curse of the K-pop industry. The news is even more remarkable considering HYBE label ADOR&#39;s ongoing battle with girl group NewJeans for the validity of their contracts.</p>

<p><strong>TXT extends journey with BIGHIT MUSIC</strong></p>

<p>Soobin, Yeonjun, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and HueningKai have decided to stay longer with their current team, bringing joyful news on the day of their new tour, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/txt-announces-7-stop-us-leg-of-act-tomorrow-world-tour-check-out-dates-venues-and-more-1393368">ACT: TOMORROW</a>, which began today, August 22 and is all set to run for many more months. Here&rsquo;s how the news was revealed to the fans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,<br />
This is BIGHIT MUSIC<br />
We would like to announce that all five members of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/txts-soobin-wonders-if-he-can-sell-bts-j-hope-older-singer-calls-himself-pride-of-gwanju-1395522">TOMORROW X TOGETHER</a> (SOOBIN, YEONJUN, BEOMGYU, TAEHYUN, HUENINGKAI) have re-signed their contracts.<br />
With this, TOMORROW X TOGETHER has kept their promise with MOA &ldquo;to go further, for longer.&quot; We are truly thankful to MOA for staying with us, and we will continue to do our very best.<br />
BIGHIT MUSIC will continue to provide full support to the group so the members can carry out a wide variety of activities. We will also faithfully fulfill our role as a strong partner and companion, ensuring that TOMORROW X TOGETHER&#39;s story-filled music and performances can reach audiences all around the world.<br />
We kindly ask MOA for your unwavering love and support. Please look forward to the shining tomorrow we will write together with TOMORROW X TOGETHER.<br />
Thank You&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how long the contracts were renewed for. However, previous renewals by company seniors show that it could be for five years at the very least. BTS first renewed their contracts in October 2018, for 5 years, following which the members were said to have renewed them for another 5 years in September 2023. The tenure of the latest one is unknown. Their first renewal came almost one year before the contract was supposed to end. In the same way, if TXT has signed for another 5 years from their expiration period in early 2026, then the group is likely to run till 2031 minimum.</p>

Rumors swirl internet as alleged ‘insider’ spills beans]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-08/728083565_blackpink.webp"></img><p>BLACKPINK is a popular pick for music festivals, having performed domestically and globally! <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jisoo-jennie-rose-and-lisa-get-nervous-for-goyang-concerts-say-journey-has-just-begun-in-bts-clip-1395592">Jisoo, Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa</a> have also led their solo performances at international events, proving their popularity among netizens from diverse countries. Recently, a new rumor has been swirling on the internet about the girls heading to Brazil in 2026 to lead the famed Rock in Rio 2025 festival. An insider who claims to be aware of the situation has dropped the K-pop girl group&rsquo;s name alongside SZA as potential headliners.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Will BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jisoo, Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa lead Rock in Rio 2026? Here&rsquo;s all we know</strong><br />
So far, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jisoo-jennie-rose-and-lisa-celebrate-blackpinks-9th-debut-anniversary-with-heartfelt-posts-and-unseen-photos-1395291">BLACKPINK</a> has performed at many musical events, but their first major overseas festival appearance was in April 2019 when they performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, becoming the first female K-pop group to do so. Across 2 weekends, the members presented about 13 songs in a power-packed setlist that boasted member Jennie&rsquo;s Solo performance. Since then, the star has also led her individual set at the latest edition of the event, with Lisa performing on her own at a different stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BLACKPINK returned for a group show at Coachella in 2023, with all four members now having their solo tracks and a longer set list. As headliners, their performance was regarded as one of the highlights of the two weeks, with 19 songs making up for a banger gig. Their most recent group takeover of a music festival was at the BST Hyde Park in July 2023, marking their end of team activities under YG Entertainment following the BORN PINK World Tour.</p>

<p>The Rock in Rio Lisboa 2026 will be held on June 20, 21, 27 and 28, 2026, at Parque Tejo Lisboa, Lisbon. Previously, BLACKPINK was rumored to headline the show at its 2024 version, but that never became a reality. It remains to be seen how this one shapes up.</p>

<p>At the moment, the group is said to be working on a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">new mini-album</a>, eyeing a November release.</p>

In a new video shared on YG Entertainment&rsquo;s YouTube channel announcing their plans for the rest of the year, founder Yang Hyun Suk confirmed the release of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">girl group&rsquo;s new album</a>. Previously, there were reports that the quartet would be working on recording and filming new music during the two-month break that the team has from touring around the world, aiming to release it around November. It seems that the plans may as well be set in stone, all thanks to the affirmative report from the man himself.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK will be in your area again!</strong><br />
On August 18 KST, Yang Hyuk Suk answered questions about new songs for BLACKPINK, who are currently touring. &ldquo;A lot of people are curious about BLACKPINK&rsquo;s album. I know that the BLACKPINK members and producers in charge of them are working very hard preparing the album. I&rsquo;m hoping for BLACKPINK&rsquo;s album to be out by November at the latest. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m pushing for. We&rsquo;ll do our best to get BLACKPINK&rsquo;s album out soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jisoo, Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa have just wrapped up the European leg of their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-extend-deadline-tour-with-concerts-in-chinas-beijing-national-stadium-fans-predict-tickets-to-sell-like-hot-cakes-1394275">DEADLINE World Tour</a> after their South Korea and North America stops. With no confirmed schedules announced as of now, it looks like the girls will either head back home to work with their signature sound team, producing new music and recording another chart-topping album. About 2 months later, the girls are all set to re-embark on their tour, starting from Kaohsiung, then more Asian cities, and ending with the final concert in January 2026, with 2 nights in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s latest music release was the digital single <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jump-debuts-at-no-28-on-billboard-hot-100-know-ateezs-career-high-score-with-in-your-fantasy-1394262">JUMP</a>, which dropped on July 11, 2025.

The singer shared how he wished to be funny and was happy to have achieved his goal. While his playing skills are not quite there yet, he was glad people found it funny. Talking to Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar Korea about it, the star revealed that his fans who have been supporting him for many years now are his biggest driving force. The rapper also shared anecdotes from his time with the group and how they often appreciate his work but don&rsquo;t want him to get hurt or break things.</p>

<p><strong>BTS and RM&rsquo;s exchanges are for the ARMY books</strong></p>

<p>Known for being the &lsquo;Destruction King&rsquo; of the group, RM finds himself with more to learn each day. During the interview, the singer shared how his conversations with the team often don&rsquo;t go as one would expect. Revealing his most common phrase to the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-relaxes-in-disneyland-with-hybe-staff-shares-quote-about-rewriting-the-narrative-amid-working-on-new-group-album-1394818">BTS</a> members pre-military, &ldquo;It used to be, &lsquo;Guys, I have something to say, gather around.&rsquo; But since I&#39;ve been in the military recently, it&#39;s &lsquo;Hey, aren&#39;t you guys tired?&rsquo; after discharge, &#39;Are you coming today?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the flip side, he shared that the members often try to save him from breaking objects, something he has been hilariously infamous for. &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything&rsquo; like driving, cooking. When I&#39;m trying something, &lsquo;Namjoon, just stay still. Don&#39;t worry, we will do it&rsquo;. I think I hear this the most. &lsquo;Namjoon, you did well, but don&#39;t do anything.&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p>Addressing his fans, RM said, &ldquo;Your presence isn&#39;t something we take for granted, and for that, we are grateful. &nbsp;The fact that you still believe in us so much, we&#39;ve had a lot of ups and downs, too.&rdquo; He added how both sides trust each other despite the many ups and downs that have framed their relationship. &ldquo;You are the foundation we lean on. We can step out into the world once more to do something that&#39;s still our greatest strength.&rdquo;</p>

A moment from their past turns up from their kitchen where the couple exchanges sweet dialogues to each other in Korean and Japanese. She asks what he&rsquo;d like to be in his next life, and while he ponders, wonders about her own choice. &lsquo;A tree&rsquo;, she says, and right then he reveals how he&rsquo;d be the lake reflecting the very tree she grows into, symbolizing their deep running love for each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The brief moment is soon broken into the scene where she&rsquo;s rowing all alone as he&rsquo;s gone. The short film ends with her spreading his ashes into the lake as the words, &lsquo;Can we be friends at least?&rsquo; play in the back.</p>

Unfounded reports swirl internet]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-08/1400466324_bts.webp"></img><p>As BTS pursues the release of new music, it seems that a hurdle stands in their way. According to reports on August 13, Bang Si Hyuk, the founder of BIGHIT MUSIC (the group&rsquo;s agency), returned to South Korea on the afternoon of August 11, leading to a stoppage in the team&rsquo;s album production process. The septet, which recently reunited as a whole following the completion of member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/watch-bts-jin-unable-to-continue-with-moon-intro-as-fans-make-him-laugh-gets-emotional-at-pink-epiphany-project-1395239">Jin&rsquo;s solo tour</a>, has been working hard on their comeback album. Meanwhile, the HYBE chairman has been summoned for a police investigation regarding a stock fraud case, which has shaken the Korean entertainment industry.</p>

<p><strong>BTS&rsquo; album plans at a standstill amid HYBE&rsquo;s stock investigation? Rumors spread</strong><br />
A report from News Tong on the day claims that owing to the ongoing questioning in the IPO case involving the media giant, Bang Si Hyuk was &lsquo;unable to finish producing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-enjoys-rare-la-outing-with-rm-suga-j-hope-jimin-and-v-posing-play-fighting-sans-this-member-1395230">BTS</a>&#39; new album in the United States and hastily returned to South Korea via the Incheon International Airport&rsquo;. While so far, no other channels have furthered the news or provided additional information, it seems unlikely that the group would cease their music production process due to this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the group shared behind-the-scenes videos from the studio where they were spotted <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkook-collaborating-with-charlie-puth-again-j-hope-updates-as-suga-rm-and-jimin-get-cooking-in-studio-1395123">hanging out with Charlie Puth</a>. Subsequently, RM also shared how he had been mingling with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jennie-joins-diplo-on-stage-during-ibiza-set-fans-share-mixed-reactions-amid-ongoing-tour-1395535">Diplo</a>. The team had shared that they planned to work with esteemed producers and composers while working on their album. A July 1 livestream confirmed their plans to head to the US for a while, and for the past month and a half, they have been going in and out of their homeland and the States while creating new music.</p>

<p>The release of their first-ever post-military comeback album is set for spring 2026, with no exact timeline being confirmed so far. As the group reunites following the completion of Jin&rsquo;s Run SeokJin Ep World Tour, fans are expecting a live session from the seven of them.</p>

WakeOne responds to rumors of extension]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-08/786311209_zerobaseone.webp"></img><p>ZEROBASEONE, the K-pop group that emerged out of the survival show Boys Planet (season 1), officially debuted on July 10, 2023. Initially set for official promotions and activities over the span of two years and six months under the management of WakeOne, the group may soon head for disbandment if the nine members do not decide to renew their contracts. It is known that the official date for their contract expiration is in January 2026, and with under 6 months left for the possible renewals, the rumors of them continuing as one team have started to spurt.</p>

<p>Amid stemming doubts and interest, Joy News 24 reported on August 12, the group had &#39;agreed to extend their activities&#39;. They quoted &lsquo;multiple music industry sources&rsquo; saying, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/did-zerobaseone-queerbait-fans-k-pop-stars-face-mixed-reactions-over-candy-game-segment-on-inkigayo-1380967">ZEROBASEONE</a> has reached an agreement with some of their agencies and members to extend their promotions, and are currently coordinating the details. They plan to conclude discussions and make an official announcement soon.&rdquo; Their believed date of disbandment is January 10, 2026.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/zerobaseone-records-milestone-as-cinema-paradise-becomes-groups-4th-consecutive-album-with-1-million-sales-1343226">ZB1</a>&#39;s management label, WakeOne, shared in a statement to Ilgan Sports, &ldquo;We highly value ZEROBASEONE&#39;s potential and possibility for growth. Accordingly, we have been continuously discussing with each member&#39;s agency since the beginning of this year about extending the project group&#39;s activity period.&quot;</p>

<p>However, it was confirmed that the discussions are going on, and that nothing had been confirmed about the renewals.</p>

<p><strong>About ZEROBASEONE or ZB1</strong><br />
The group comprising members Sung Han Bin, Kim Ji Woong, Zhang Hao, Seok Matthew, Kim Tae Rae, Ricky, Kim Gyu Vin, Park Gun Wook, and Han Yu Jin, went viral for being the first to have a non-Korean member debut at the top spot. While the competition between Sung Han Bin and Chinese participant Zhang Hao was always at fervor pitch during the course of the show, it surpassed all expectations with the latter&rsquo;s placement on top at the end. His fame directed the program companies to consider the popularity and talents of overseas stars, spawning the possibility of a fully-Chinese K-pop group in the second edition of the show.</p>

<p>ZB1 will release their first studio album, NEVER SAY NEVER, on September 1, followed by a tour in October.</p>

Another five-piece, much like their predecessors, the team will comprise members Martin, James, Juhoon, Seonghyeon, and Keonho, ranging from 16 to 19 years old. Opening up about the help they&rsquo;ve received from their sunbaes, the boys shared how the iconic septet want them to be kind to others and build upon their experiences from rookie idols to adept ones in the future.</p>

<p><strong>BTS wants CORTIS to be humble and adaptive, much like themselves</strong><br />
Talking to Rolling Stone about their upcoming highly anticipated debut, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-and-txts-junior-group-at-bighit-music-confirms-name-cortis-to-debut-on-august-18-heres-all-we-know-1395213">CORTIS</a> shared the advice from other HYBE artists or BIGHIT MUSIC artists that has remained with them. As revealed by leader Martin, the seniors from the same label, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-reveals-he-cried-watching-jungkook-j-hope-and-jin-perform-together-too-embarrassed-1395443">BTS</a>, who have built themselves up from the bottom, showed their down-to-earth nature once again by saying, &ldquo;&lsquo;Do well by the people that you&#39;re working with, the staff.&rsquo; And I feel like that&#39;s all that matters. To hit a long run, you&#39;ve got to be good to the people around you. You&#39;ve got to show love.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
Known to have been some of the kindest artists to work with, the chart-toppers want the same habits to be inculcated in their hoobaes.</p>

<p>It seems that the younger ones have taken it in stride, as the oldest member, James, added, &ldquo;I think in the end, we make up CORTIS, but at the same time, the staff and everyone included - they&#39;re all part of CORTIS. It&#39;s all a big team and big family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t all, the 12-year professionals took a leaf out of their own growth to enlighten about the fact that debuting is not the end of their K-pop careers, considering how big and difficult that is considered to be. Kickstarting your life as singers in the industry can be the start of something great, and CORTIS needs to evolve over time without trying to attain perfection right from the get-go.</p>

<p>CORTIS is all set to debut on August 18 with an album titled COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES.</p>

Well, it also seems that the stars are not leaving the music charts anytime soon, either, with Golden, Your Idol, and Soda Pop becoming quick crowd favorites. Now, the fictional team of HUNTRIX has managed to surpass records held by K-pop industry giants <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/critic-calls-newjeans-one-year-hiatus-fatal-amid-losing-contracts-to-stray-kids-aespa-and-more-1392107">NewJeans</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-reveals-he-cried-watching-jungkook-j-hope-and-jin-perform-together-too-embarrassed-1395443">BTS</a> by grabbing the most numer of Perfect All-Kills in history.</p>

<p>Comprising members Rumi, Zoey, and Mira, the girl group in the show, centered around the half-demon half-hunter protagonist leader, HUNTRIX, has been on everyone&rsquo;s mind, especially with its song Golden and now atop charts. Following the release of the show on June 20, they&rsquo;ve become household names around the world and beaten the likes of NewJeans&rsquo; Ditto, which held the record for the maximum PAKs since the release of its song in 2022. As of August 11 at 10 AM KST, HUNTRIX&rsquo;s Golden beat the record for the most number of hourly PAKs, grabbing the 656th one and overtaking the five-member HYBE girl group.</p>

<p>The list now has the two female teams followed by BTS&rsquo; Dynamite, which wreaked havoc with 610 of its own in 2022. Other famed acts in the chart include IU&rsquo;s Celebrity with 462 PAKs in 2020, IVE&rsquo;s I AM with 359 in 2023, IU&rsquo;s Love wins all with 339 in 2024, ZICO&rsquo;s Any Song with 330 in 2020, and aespa&rsquo;s Supernova with 317 in 2024. The KPop Demon Hunters number is expected to reach a new all-time high and grow further up with the undying love for the animated film.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s a Perfect All-Kill?</strong><br />
In the world of K-pop, a PAK or Perfect All-Kill refers to the number 1 ranking of a song across all daily and real-time music charts, including Melon, Genie Music, YouTube Music, FLO, VIBE, and Bugs in South Korea, and is recorded by iChart. Fans are expecting it to cross 700 soon, with more listeners joining in the Golden fun every day!</p>

Talking about the dreamy moment, which left the fans in the audience cheering and crying, V spoke to W Korea about how the performance made him tear up. While J-Hope was joined by Jungkook for i wonder and Seven, and then by Jin for Spring Day, followed by his solo Don&rsquo;t Say You Love Me and then the trio for Jamais Vu. Observing from the sidelines, RM, SUGA, Jimin, and V, provided full support in a lovely turn of events for the fans who celebrated it with them.</p>

<p>Recalling the concert, the Layover singer said, &ldquo;Actually, I shed a few tears during Hobi hyung&rsquo;s performance, I quietly shed a tear by myself. During the duet with Jungkook&hellip; I got choked up. I was too embarrassed to say anything (It was a secret). I watched the performance confidently.&rdquo; He added how Jin and J-Hope&rsquo;s concerts were starkly different, which was a fun experience for him, sharing that he liked the oldest member&rsquo;s Rope It performance.</p>

<p>The scene has become engraved in the minds of the fans as all seven members finally united publicly in about 3 months for an official event towards the end of their military era. At the time, only member SUGA was known to be working as a public service employee while the other six had wrapped up their enlistments. In a behind-the-scenes moment from the concert, all members popped in backstage to greet J-Hope, meanwhile Jin and Jungkook expressed their nervous feelings before returning to the stage.</p>

After ending their European leg of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-extend-deadline-tour-with-concerts-in-chinas-beijing-national-stadium-fans-predict-tickets-to-sell-like-hot-cakes-1394275">DEADLINE World Tour</a> in London with two concerts on August 15 and 16, Jisoo, Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa will have a couple of months on their hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The news shared by an insider quoted their plans as, &quot;BLACKPINK will release an album within this year. Originally, they were aiming for an October release, but the schedule has changed, and they are planning to release it in November and possibly perform on music shows.&quot;</p>

<p>In a response to Newsen, the group&rsquo;s management label, YG Entertainment, said, &ldquo;We will announce details through official promotions at a later date.&rdquo; This more or less means confirmation from the agency&rsquo;s end; however, it remains to be seen how the idea pans out over the next few months. Their last record, a whopping 38 months ago, was the studio album BORN PINK, which included the title track Shut Down and managed to rip all charts to pieces to broken records.&nbsp;</p>

And while he has been mingling with members of other groups, it is unknown how his friendship with EXO&rsquo;s Chanyeol came to be. SEVENTEEN and NCT members are known to be close, so it&rsquo;s no shocker that they decided to hang out, as they&rsquo;ve previously praised each other repeatedly and appeared on variety shows together.</p>

She unilaterally filed a lawsuit to leave the group and terminate her contract with JYP Entertainment, raising concerns about her future in the industry. She blamed the staff members behind the team as the reason for her decision and claimed that subpar working conditions made her take the step. As the agency continued to deny the claims, there have been multiple narratives being spoken about on the internet. Now, it seems that the row has come to an end, and both parties have decided to part ways with mutual agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>KG Crown announces her exit from JYP Entertainment, confirming her VCHA departure as well</strong><br />
Taking to her personal Instagram account, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/former-vcha-member-kg-to-attend-first-court-hearing-against-jyp-entertainment-on-march-6-with-proceedings-open-to-the-public-1375198">KG</a> wrote on August 8, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/vchas-kg-responds-to-jyp-usa-refuting-her-false-and-exaggerated-claims-says-prepared-with-physical-evidence-1361871">JYP America</a> and KG Crown have mutually agreed to part ways as she concludes her journey with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/has-vcha-officially-disbanded-jyp-entertainment-girl-group-disappears-from-social-media-amid-fan-concerns-1395145">VCHA</a>. Both parties sincerely wish each other all the best in their future endeavors. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While it is unknown what happened to the legal case that was underway between the two sides, it can be assumed that KG Crown seems to have dropped the lawsuit or has decided to settle outside the court. It is also not known if JYP Entertainment will be pursuing further action pertaining to not fulfilling her contractual obligations. The company seems to be discussing it directly with the singer after months of denial on both ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the star claimed that unfair conditions made her receive very little pay, and as someone who wishes to continue with their songwriting and production, she would like to explore a different journey for herself. Other than her, member Kaylee of VCHA also decided to end her contract with the agency back in July and withdrew from the group as well as the company after a long hiatus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the remaining members of the team, Camila, Lexi, Kendall, and Savanna, will be promoting under a new group name GIRLSET.</p>

<p>It was previously announced that the group will comprise five members: Martin, James, Juhoon, Seonghyeon, and Keonho. They have dubbed the team a &lsquo;young creator crew&rsquo;, taking on a new challenge as a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/when-will-bts-and-txt-juniors-debut-heres-all-we-know-about-hybes-upcoming-self-produced-boy-group-and-members-1391612">self-producing group</a>, who will work on their own music, choreography, and videos. The quintet will showcase their talent in the fields of composing, writing lyrics, performance, videography, and more. Much like their seniors, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, the members will not have fixed positions but will all work together on multiple aspects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The young group members have credits in previously released K-pop music of their seniors, including TXT&rsquo;s Deja Vu, Miracle, and most recently, Beautiful Strangers, ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Outside, LE SSERAFIM&rsquo;s Pierrot, and ILLIT&rsquo;s Magnetic, where member Martin pitched in. James has contributed to the choreography of Deja Vu, Magnetic, ILLIT&rsquo;s Cherish (My Love) and Tick-Tack. The two have collaborated on Deja Vu, Miracle, and Magnetic, showing their pre-existing teamwork.</p>

<p>A lot of attention is being paid to the young team that will follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jungkook-adds-over-200k-fans-on-instagram-in-last-24-hours-all-bts-members-among-top-10-most-followed-k-pop-artists-1395204">BTS</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/txt-announces-7-stop-us-leg-of-act-tomorrow-world-tour-check-out-dates-venues-and-more-1393368">TXT</a>, as BIGHIT MUSIC&rsquo;s boy groups, who have each achieved international success.</p>

BTS has neither visited Grouse Lodge Studio in Ireland nor taken part in any recording sessions at the location for the mentioned project. The group is not involved in the tribute album in any capacity.<br />
We are continuing to take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of inaccurate information.<br />
We express our sincere gratitude to fans for continuously showing support for BTS.<br />
We remain fully committed to supporting the artists and their endeavors.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Believed to have been planned during Michael Jackson&rsquo;s stay in Ireland in 2006 in an upcycled cow shed, the said unreleased tracks sat in the archives for about 2 decades. Early last year, reports of there being a tribute album, involving countless superstars from around the world, began making the rounds. The latest update coming from the studio owner himself seems to be more of a wish than reality, bumming out the fans of the two artists. &nbsp;</p>

An impressive bunch, the three led hoards of crowds at the Chicago venue and made it their mission to make the audience go crazy. A sight to behold, the TWICE girlies had their headliner set on August 2, with an unbelievable 21-song setlist that made the crowds go wild in cheers. Interestingly, their set was not all sunshine and roses on the organizers&rsquo; end, who apparently had to cut off the mics that the members were singing into after multiple rounds of encore song performances surpassed their timeline.</p>

<p><strong>TWICE enjoys demands of more from thousands at Lollapalooza</strong></p>

<p>Attendees of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/twice-is-all-set-to-renew-their-contract-with-jyp-entertainment-for-2nd-time-ahead-of-10th-anniversary-report-1394265">TWICE</a>&rsquo;s history-making set noted that an almost concert-like situation broke through when the nine-piece took to the stage. Hit after&nbsp;hit, the members left no stone unturned to show off their charms and impress the audience. With their career-defining title tracks seemingly eyeing no end, the girl group took charge with live vocals and impressive choreography, not once appearing to be tired or laidback. With Feel Special, their run had almost come to an end, but the crowd was not ready to let them go. The members each had given their all but were not willing to give up, appeared interested in another encore, obliging with the demand for &lsquo;one more song&rsquo;.</p>

<p>However, their voices went unheard as the show makers quickly put an end to the demand with sound from the mic seemingly not being up to par anymore, as noted by the singers themselves. On enquiring if they could go longer, the answer appeared to be no. The members each had to then bid goodbye one by one as the mics would not let out any more sound, and they only managed to get a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in. This form of ending a show is pretty normal for music events, which work on pre-decided timelines. Executing a 4-day event for such a large crowd and countless artists is no small feat, and it is only with discipline and sticking to the plan that they&rsquo;re able to achieve resounding success.&nbsp;</p>

Well, it looks like it was all for a reason! According to a report from The Irish Sun, the group has been working on recording a new song, written by none other than the King of Pop himself, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/michael-jackson-biopic-michael-gets-new-release-date-after-reshoots-and-legal-changes-details-inside-1394468">Michael Jackson</a>. The news was shared during an interview&nbsp;on July 4, and with that, the mania of disbelief and praise followed for the South Korean septet that has redefined what K-pop means in the West.</p>

<p><strong>What is BTS&rsquo; contribution to Michael Jackson&rsquo;s unreleased art?</strong><br />
Said to have been written in 2006 with some of the best names in town, and meant for release in what would be the icon&rsquo;s next album, these tracks have been in the archives for close to 2 decades. Penned in a converted cow shed at Grouse Lodge, Ireland, the songs were meant to be his next major comeback, but they never got to see the light of day. Grouse Lodge studio owner Paddy Dunning spoke in an interview about the fate of this record, which was previously rumored to be a part of a tribute album. Now, &lsquo;global superstars&rsquo; are being roped in to record these songs, and who better than the hottest name in musical land, BTS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sessions started last year, and we have already had the Korean boy band <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/v-gets-cozy-on-jungkooks-lap-shares-bts-gym-session-peek-and-another-look-at-vatman-vs-ninjakook-in-new-update-1395043">BTS</a> over with us in Grouse Lodge, recording one of the songs,&rdquo; he revealed. Speaking about the other artists rumored to be on the project, without giving too much away, he added, &ldquo;There are about ten more tracks, written especially for Michael by his collaborators here in Ireland, including producer Rodney Jerkins and rapper Nephew, who are fully on board with the project.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the BTS members have been working on their own comeback album, eyeing a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jin-says-bts-members-are-prepping-hard-for-spring-2026-album-doing-well-physically-and-mentally-theyre-giggling-1394013">spring 2026 release</a>. With teamwork going down in Los Angeles, as the singers fly between South Korea and the United States, fans wait eagerly for any updates. So far, the group has not commented on their work on Michael Jackson&rsquo;s music.</p>

USD 102 million). The sharp growth was largely driven by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-j-hope-sells-off-4-billion-krw-seoul-apartment-earning-1-65-billion-profit-keeps-another-unit-in-same-complex-1394763">BTS member j-hope&rsquo;s</a> successful solo tour, Hope on the Stage, alongside performances by other HYBE America artists. According to a July 28 report by MTN News, this marks one of the biggest quarterly boosts for the company in recent years.</p>

<p>Meritz Securities attributed much of the revenue jump to j-hope&rsquo;s tour and the growing presence of HYBE&rsquo;s American roster. The rapper&rsquo;s tour drew massive crowds in the U.S. and Mexico, highlighting his individual star power post-military service.</p>

<p><strong>12 sold-out shows in the U.S. and Mexico</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hope-on-the-stage-live-viewing-review-bts-j-hope-shuts-down-fake-abs-rumors-slays-singing-and-dancing-worthy-of-ace-tag-1390282">Hope on the Stage</a> kicked off in April 2025 and included 12 shows across major cities such as Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Oakland, and Mexico City. Around 178,000 fans attended the concerts. j-hope performed songs from his albums Jack in the Box and Hope on the Street Vol.1, with each show drawing consistent demand. MTN News highlighted the steady ticket sales across cities as a sign of BTS&rsquo; ongoing fan loyalty and j-hope&rsquo;s solo appeal.</p>

<p>HYBE also gained revenue through merchandise and fan spending. Analysts estimate that fans at U.S. concerts spent an average of USD 60 on merchandise, with about 22% of attendees making purchases.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how the tour wrapped up with a special BTS moment</strong></p>

<p>The tour officially ended on June 14 at Goyang Stadium in South Korea. The first night of the finale coincided with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-festa-2025-jin-and-j-hope-kick-off-12th-anniversary-bash-all-we-know-so-far-from-theme-to-new-content-plan-1390245">BTS&rsquo; 12th anniversary</a> and turned into an unexpected OT7 reunion. All seven BTS members attended to cheer j-hope on. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jin-reveals-real-reason-why-jungkook-and-v-are-ultimate-fit-for-handsome-guys-show-can-you-guess-his-answer-1387876">Jin and Jungkook</a> even joined him onstage to perform Jamais Vu, and later shared their own solo stages, an emotional moment fans later called the &ldquo;unofficial BTS 2025 Festa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite earlier concerns about K-pop&rsquo;s slowdown, 2025 data shows a rebound. Acts like Stray Kids, ENHYPEN, ATEEZ, SEVENTEEN, and LE SSERAFIM ranked in the U.S. Top 10 CD Albums list for the first half of 2025, according to Luminate. Stray Kids&rsquo; HOP sold 149,000 copies in the U.S., placing second overall.</p>

After taking a hiatus in November 2023 over the leak of his private life before K-pop idol debut, Seunghan briefly <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/riizes-seunghan-expresses-regret-for-past-actions-in-handwritten-letter-ahead-of-return-to-group-1353075">returned in October 2024</a>, looking forward to making it with the team again. But the intense backlash had him <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/breaking-seunghan-leaves-riize-2-days-after-announcing-return-to-group-activities-1353334">withdraw from the team</a> completely within a couple of days. Since then, he has been absent from the public eye, only to return as a soloist now under a new moniker XngHan. The 21-year-old has spoken about his former team, sharing how he now roots for them.</p>

<p><strong>Seunghan cheers for RIIZE and wishes for their good health</strong><br />
Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter on the release of his first solo record, Waste No Time, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/seunghan-reveals-why-he-decided-to-leave-riize-in-new-letter-addressing-fans-1353344">Seunghan</a> added that he wishes it would be a new beginning in his musical career. A handsome young lad, he has a bright future ahead of him and replying to a question about &lsquo;what he wishes for his former team RIIZE,&rsquo; he revealed, &ldquo;I know that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/are-riizes-wonbin-and-aespas-giselle-dating-fans-connect-dots-based-on-their-eye-rolls-1393351">RIIZE</a> is doing so well, [and] I&rsquo;m rooting for them as a fellow artist.&rdquo; Adding that he hopes everything would go well for his ex-teammates and now labelmates, he hopes they would stay &lsquo;healthy and well&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This marks the first time in about a year that he has spoken up about the team, after being at the end of a lot of flak online for thinking about returning to them. In his last letting before leaving the team, Seunghan shared how he wished no harm to the members of RIIZE and looked forward to their future. Now, returning to the stage as two separate acts, fans are curious how they will react to each other&rsquo;s music. Excitement is also heightened when the former groupmates talk about his debut as XngHan and react to his new single album.</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>KANG YUCHAN:&nbsp;</strong>Both A.C.E and UNB were meaningful and special experiences for me. The teamwork with the A.C.E members whom I have known for a long time is impeccable. UNB was a new challenge for all members, since we all came from different teams, but we created harmony within the group. Both of these teams made me grow as a person in different ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As someone who has participated in a survival show, what are the 3 things you&rsquo;d like a newbie to know before going on one? Would you ever try it one more time?</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>KANG YUCHAN:&nbsp;</strong>If I were to give to a newbie who is going to go on a survival show, it would be:<br />
First: protect your own color, your identity.<br />
Second: Don&rsquo;t be swayed by the feedback too much - let it nourish your growth, but never lose sight of your essence.<br />
Third: taking care of your physical strength is essential.&nbsp;<br />
If such an opportunity arises for me&hellip; I would have to think about it, but I&rsquo;m sure I would be able to show a more mature side of myself if I were to do it!</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve done it all, singing, acting, and musicals. What&rsquo;s next for YUCHAN? What was the toughest of them all to ace?</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>KANG YUCHAN:&nbsp;</strong>In the future, I&rsquo;d like to try songs that capture deeper, more heartfelt emotions. When it comes to acting, I want to take on more serious, grounded roles as well.<br />
As for what was the toughest challenge to ace&hellip; I think it would be musicals. It&rsquo;s a complex art that requires excellent concentration, since it involves singing live, acting, as well as performing choreography.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your message for your fans as they continue to cheer for your new journey?</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>KANG YUCHAN:&nbsp;</strong>Thank you so much to all of my fans who have believed in me and supported me.&nbsp;This solo debut was made possible because of you.&nbsp; Moving forward, I will show you diverse sides of me while growing as an artist and challenging myself. I want to repay you for your love with good music and amazing performances.&nbsp;</p>

After releasing on June 20, 2025, the animated Netflix film has quickly become one of the most viral releases this year. With the storyline, animation, and especially the songs grabbing global attention, it&rsquo;s no surprise that there&rsquo;s talk about the many inspirations for the film, and the animators of the film have finally spoken up about their inspirations stemming from many real-life K-pop stars, including IT boy EXO member Kai.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how KPop Demon Hunters brings Jinu to life with the help of Kai</strong><br />
Korean designers Wi Hyun Song and Min Hong spoke to Korean media outlet Hankyung about the creation of one of the most spoken-about characters from the animation- Jinu. Voiced by Ahn Hyo Seop, the male lead is the start of the exciting bits in the film. As a demon, he catches the attention of the demon hunter, Rumi, voiced by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kpop-demon-hunterss-arden-cho-equates-bts-to-epitome-of-k-pop-fame-recalls-escaping-to-watch-concert-during-filming-1393853">Arden Cho</a>.</p>

<p>Recalling how director Maggie Kang spoke about checking out a never-before-seen demon, Wi Hyun Song, who became a designer for the project. And thus began the creation of Gwi Ma, which was eventually voiced by Squid Game star Lee Byung Hun. Meanwhile, Min Hong revealed, referencing the dance videos of popular K-pop boy groups MONSTA X and SHINee for the animation of the Saja Boys&rsquo; dance during for debut track, Soda Pop. He added how &ldquo;natural movements referencing the choreography of domestic idol groups&rdquo; helped him immensely during the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was not where the similarities ended, however, as he added how, &ldquo;in order to bring to life the facial expressions of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/cha-eun-woo-embodies-real-life-jinu-from-kpop-demon-hunters-with-arden-chos-rumi-for-free-cover-fans-left-mesmerized-1394643">Jinu</a>&rdquo;, he turned to EXO member Kai.

According to a report from Wow TV Korea, the singer let go of his one unit at the luxurious venue earlier this year to avoid more tax burden. With the initial purchase price believed to be around 4 billion KRW, he is said to have pocketed a whopping 2.7 billion KRW over the nine years since his buying it initially in July 2016. Taking away the approximate 1 billion KRW tax paid by the star for the gains on his properties, his overall profits amount to an estimated 1.65 billion KRW.</p>

<p><strong>Inside J-Hope&rsquo;s luxury real estate</strong><br />
As per real estate industry sources and the Supreme Court Registry, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/j-hope-confirms-bts-2-month-absence-from-south-korea-en-route-to-lollapalooza-gets-ready-to-work-in-la-1393356">J-Hope</a> sold an 84 square meter unit in Trimage in Seongsu-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, which he is believed to have purchased in March of this year. Another unit of 152 square meter in the same complex is said to be under his name as of now. It was purchased in October 2018 for 3.7 billion KRW. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-debuts-permission-to-dance-on-stage-live-on-billboard-200-jungkooks-seven-reigns-on-global-200-global-excl-us-1394711">BTS</a> rapper&rsquo;s luxury home collection does not end here, as he is known to have 2 more apartments in the swanky neighborhood of Aper Hangang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 273 square meter home at 12 billion KRW and another 232 square meter unit for approximately 10 billion KRW were bought in June 2020. Five years on, the total value of the four properties owned by J-Hope amounts to around 27 billion KRW. Interestingly, all these are known to have been purchased in cash and without any loan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having a knack for owning luxurious items, including watches, bags, jewellery, and more, J-Hope is believed to be one of the richest in the team, if not the richest. With his and fellow BTS teammates&rsquo; shares in their company HYBE, the singers have maintained a high status when it comes to their real estate which largely contributes to their net worth.</p>

RIVR, mostly quiet throughout so far, perked up on being asked about their fans and recalled how the support made him appreciate them more each time, and work hard to release good content.</p>

<p>DOY mentioned how maintaining their thoughts of why the members first began their careers as K-pop stars has been the biggest driving force for the group&rsquo;s unity. Giving a shoutout to some of their most-cherished inspirations, the group dropped some big names, including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-and-park-hyo-shin-melt-hearts-in-new-photos-playing-in-the-snow-see-1360696">Park Hyo Shin</a>, as their reason to pursue music. Summing it up, the team added that wanting to make the world a better place to live and provide strength to their listeners via their music is the purpose of dreaming about the idol life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The members reminisced about their debut day of February 28, 2024, when their families and friends cheered for their future, in hopes of seeing the team grow further. Much like their name, NOMAD, they wish to set their unique identity in the musical scene and leave a mark with their actions, much like graffiti. The group continues to live with that thought while working to get better each day.</p>
