Helmed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyadarshan-wants-to-save-rajpal-yadav-says-poor-guy-erred-due-to-less-education-i-knew-about-his-problem-1400737">Priyadarshan</a>, the film is produced by Shobha Kapoor, Ektaa R Kapoor, and Akshay Kumar.</p>

<p><strong>Akshay Kumar&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a known fact that Akshay&nbsp;delivers multiple movies in a year. Hence, after Bhooth Bangla, he will be seen in another family entertainer, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/welcome-to-the-jungle-akshay-kumar-suniel-shetty-raveena-tandons-film-to-hit-cinemas-on-june-26-1400237">Welcome to the Jungle</a>.

<p>While speaking to Pinkvilla, Khan revealed that it&rsquo;s not a comedy film, but rather one with dark and situational humor. &ldquo;Of course, it&#39;s serious cinema, not a comedy or slapstick,&rdquo; Ahmed added. The movie is set to hit theatres on June 26, 2026.</p>

She set up dual homes, one in Mumbai and one in the US, for global prospects, which have now paid off. There have always been <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-didnt-want-to-leave-bollywood-says-she-was-pushed-because-of-limitations-in-hindi-films-1400919">questions about her exit</a> and recent decision to return, and in a recent chat with Jay Shetty, the actress has opened up on feeling &lsquo;cornered&rsquo; in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p><strong>Priyanka Chopra recalls feeling the difficulty of survival in Bollywood</strong></p>

<p>Sharing how &lsquo;fleeting&rsquo; the connections can be in the business, she said, &quot;Surviving in the movie industry is tough for everyone; it is not an easy place. It is political, networky, it is about the moment.&quot; She opened up about being at a point where things were not the best, &quot;I did feel like I was in a place where I was cornered...work was limited...in order to survive emotionally... I just needed to move.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, deciding to move was the only option she had, and she felt that shifting to a different country would provide her with solutions. Being in Bollywood only would stagnate her options, which is not what she wanted, and&nbsp;she shared, &quot;I was in this place where I was doing good work, but didn&#39;t see the longevity that I wanted.&quot;</p>

<p>However, working abroad was different as meeting up with foreign musicians felt transformative for the star, making her feel &lsquo;blown away&rsquo;. She added, &ldquo;By being in the studio with will.i.am, Pitbull... It was such a welcome change. It was a breath of fresh air.&quot; And that allowed her to come out of the box of only acting and try something new. She added, &quot;I was feeling like I was drowning, and I was suddenly pulled out, and I could breathe.&quot;</p>

Appearing on the Jay Shetty Podcast, Priyanka described the period as a &ldquo;personally traumatic time,&rdquo; recalling the emotional strain she and husband <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/nick-jonas-is-beyond-proud-of-wife-priyanka-chopra-for-leading-and-producing-the-bluff-more-in-awe-of-you-1400879">Nick Jonas</a> experienced while their newborn was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The actress revealed that the initial days were filled with uncertainty, fear, and helplessness as they navigated hospital protocols and fragile hope.<br />
<br />
<strong>Priyanka Chopra recalls daughter Malt&#39;s birth</strong><br />
<br />
Sharing a deeply personal memory, Priyanka said, &ldquo;We went with her to the NICU. One of us was allowed at a time, and she cried the first time. It was like a cat (makes a sound like a kitten). That&#39;s all we got. My mom and in-laws flew down, but we were in the hospital. It was such a personally traumatic time. But somehow, because we were in and out of the hospital, I remember it leaked and we got a text saying that her birth is gonna be put out by the papers, that if we don&#39;t, they are going to in three hours. So we were kind of forced into announcing her birth. We wanted to hold onto our own narrative of it; we weren&#39;t ready because we didn&#39;t know what would happen with her or how she would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For nearly three months, the couple paused all professional commitments to remain by Malti&rsquo;s side. Priyanka revealed, &ldquo;Nick would sing to her on his guitar. I used to have this little iPod which played all my mantras, my Mahamrityunjay Mantra, my Gayatri Mantra, my Om Namah Shiv mantra, all of it would play all day inside her crib softly. There were a lot of people praying for her. She was very very desired, very coveted, and treasured. It was so hard, her journey to get to this planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Priyanka and Nick got married in 2018 in Rajasthan in both Hindu and Christian ceremonies. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-calls-nick-jonas-best-decision-i-ever-made-in-romantic-update-shares-unseen-early-relationship-pics-1400530">The couple</a>&nbsp;welcomed Malti in January 2022. Since then, they have largely maintained privacy around her life, occasionally sharing glimpses.</p>

But since the veteran writer was in the ICU, Aamir couldn&rsquo;t meet him personally. But he has been constantly in touch with the Khans and taking and update about their father&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>While talking to the media recently, the Dangal actor revealed, &ldquo;Main Salim sahab se milne gaya tha, hum sab dua kar rahe hai ke woh jaldi se achche hojaye.

He was in the ICU, so I couldn&#39;t meet him in person, but I sat with his family).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aamir further added that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khan-and-family-displeased-by-health-update-on-salim-khan-they-want-to-avoid-1400909">Salman Khan</a>&rsquo;s sister Alvira Khan Agnihotri informed him, &ldquo;Har roz ke unki health improve ho rahi hai (Every day, his health is improving.)&rdquo; Aamir concluded that they are praying that Salim Khan&nbsp;gets well soon and returns home as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>About Salim Khan&rsquo;s hospitalisation</strong></p>

<p>The day he was hospitalized, the doctors saw him in the casualty department, after which he was taken to the ICU. A doctor later informed the media that Salim Khan was having jerks, and his blood pressure was high. Since they wanted to do certain investigations on him, they put him on the ventilator. Later, a Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) procedure was performed by a neurosurgeon on the veteran writer, after which his health was stable,&nbsp;and he was on the road to recovery.</p>

During an Instagram Live on February 14, Kapoor stated that the movie is now eyeing a December 2026 or early 2027 release window.</p>

<p>In January 2026, Pinkvilla exclusively reported that the movie had been pushed to an undisclosed date in 2027. An insider told us that a significant portion of the shoot is still pending. Therefore, the makers had to rework the film&rsquo;s timeline. The current plan is to wrap principal photography by June, after which the film will enter an extensive post-production phase. Since SLB strives for perfection, he is taking enough time in post-production until the VFX and other key elements of the movie come out right.</p>

<p>The BAFTA was an awaited event of 2026. At the 79th edition of the&nbsp;British Academy Film Awards, the Indian contingent shined bright. While Alia Bhatt presented an award, the Indian film Boong won an award. In the In Memoriam segment, the academy remembered the late legend, Bollywood actor Dharmendra, alongside many big names from the entertainment industry across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>BAFTA 2026 pays tribute to Dharmendra</strong></p>

<p>Indian actor and Bollywood icon, 89-year-old <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/dharmendra-passes-away-amitabh-bachchan-abhishek-arrive-at-legendary-actors-residence-1398681">Dharmendra</a>, left for his heavenly abode in November 2025, leaving a huge void.

Photographers at the site noted that the star arrived in his car at the healthcare facility to get an update on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khans-father-salim-khan-admitted-to-hospital-heres-what-we-know-1400816">Salim Khan&rsquo;s health</a>, who has been admitted there since the morning of February 17.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SRK gets an update on Salim Khan&rsquo;s health with a hospital visit</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday evening, Shah Rukh Khan made his way to Lilavati Hospital to check on Salim Khan. He was spotted arriving in his car shortly after Salman Khan was recorded visiting the hospital. After being inside for close to an hour, King Khan was noted to have exited the premises of the facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subsequently, Malaika Arora, the ex-wife of Salim Khan&rsquo;s son, Arbaaz Khan, was also sighted visiting the hospital today. Zeeshan Ziauddin Siddique, the son of Baba Siddique, also arrived to check on the 90-year-old&rsquo;s health, as well as Avinash Gowariker.</p>

<p>The Khan family, including the kids, their in-laws, and the grandchildren of Salim Khan, have regularly been paying a visit to be by his side as he recovers. After being admitted early morning on Tuesday, the veteran writer was known to have had a brain haemorrhage. As shared by the concerned health professional, after keeping him on ventilator support as a precautionary measure and not because he was critical, a procedure called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khans-father-salim-khan-undergoes-angiography-doctor-hopeful-about-taking-him-off-ventilator-on-february-19-1400848">Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) was performed</a> the following day.&nbsp;</p>

Following his update, as per Variety India, the Khan family expressed displeasure with confidential details being revealed to the public without their consent and denounced any similar acts in the future.&nbsp;</p>

While the earnings for both films have been highly anticipated, it seems that their inevitable tussle at the cinemas might affect them, or so Sanjay Gupta believes. Speaking to Variety India, the director spoke about how the two films will just end up eating each other&rsquo;s business in the unfortunate meeting at the box office.</p>

<p><strong>Sanjay Gupta shares disappointment over Dhurandhar 2 and Toxic&rsquo;s clash</strong></p>

<p>Giving the example of his film Kaabil, which clashed with Raees, he believes both would have been better off without the clash and has attributed it to the financial status of the country. He said, &ldquo;Our people don&rsquo;t have money flowing that they can just go and watch two films back-to-back. There are many people who can&rsquo;t watch two films in one month. It&rsquo;s unnecessary, but again, the makers probably have their reasons.&quot; And while he himself would be turning up for both projects, that seems less likely for the masses, according to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He predicted that both films would be able to perform; however, achieving their maximum potential is where he sees the problem,&nbsp;&ldquo;Both films will do well, but neither will accomplish their individual capacity. So, it&rsquo;s unfortunate.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He lavished praise on the Aditya Dhar directorial and hinted at the future of Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s character. He shared, &ldquo;I have a vague idea of where the story is going to go and all of that. We&rsquo;re going to have Hamza&rsquo;s backstory, why he became who he is, and all of that. See, Dhurandhar is a phenomenon.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Toxic has gained many eyeballs due to its star cast, including Yash, Nayanthara, Kiara Advani, Tara Sutaria, and more.</p>

<p>Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Yash starrer Toxic: A Fairytale For Adults are all for a March 19 premiere.</p>

Giving an insight as to what may have brought the change and how her decision was based on opportunities back home, she shared her opinions on choosing what felt &lsquo;exciting&rsquo; for her at the time, and wanting to explore other options.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Priyanka Chopra talks about moving away from Bollywood due to its limitations</strong></p>

<p>After working in the Hindi film industry for many years, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/vin-diesel-praises-priyanka-chopra-jonas-incredible-talent-at-the-bluff-premiere-shes-amazing-in-the-film-1400850">Priyanka Chopra</a> moved abroad and took on English-language projects. Opening up about how the plan was to seek more chances that would break away from the limited possibilities being presented to her in Bollywood and how she felt being &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; into doing so, the actress shared to Firstpost how the journey has been. She said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever wanted to leave Bollywood. I felt limited for many reasons when I was working in Hindi films. I was being pushed into&hellip; I was looking for opportunities that felt exciting to me as an artist and I landed up working in America.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shift has not been easy as the actress juggles between India and Los Angeles, shooting for a SS Rajamouli project while promoting her latest work, The Bluff. However, the 43-year-old is finding momentum in having the choice and loves to be back to her country at the same time. &ldquo;I am really excited to be doing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-priyanka-chopra-jonas-calls-mahesh-babu-starrer-a-career-defining-film-says-ss-rajamouli-is-the-best-in-india-1400872">Varanasi</a> in India again. I would hate to have to choose between the two. I straddle both the worlds and I enjoy working in both the industries. They are both different in many ways just as cultures,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>The actress moved to the West over a decade ago and started off her career there with projects like Quantico, and has continued to maintain double bases in India and the US. Following her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-recalls-hurtful-scrutiny-around-marriage-to-nick-jonas-rubbed-people-the-wrong-way-1400668">marriage to Nick Jonas</a>, the couple has welcomed daughter Malti Marie, whom they&rsquo;re raising together in California.</p>

While many speculated that a wedding is on the cards for the celebs, the Do Deewane Seher Mein actress was quick to state that she hasn&rsquo;t found the right person yet. Now, Mrunal shared her opinions on arranged marriage, stating that she&rsquo;s open to it. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Mrunal Thakur on arranged marriage</strong></h3>

<p>Do Deewane Seher Mein co-stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/mrunal-thakur-says-marriage-is-on-the-cards-after-denying-feb-14-wedding-to-dhanush-do-it-with-right-person-1400736">Mrunal Thakur</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/amid-dating-rumors-with-dhanush-mrunal-thakur-gets-teased-by-siddhant-chaturvedi-for-a-chennai-question-1400474">Siddhant Chaturvedi</a> were in a conversation with Showshaa India. During the chat, the actress revealed that she is open to arranged marriage. She divulged that plans for her wedding are like daydreaming in her parents&rsquo; minds, and the wedding bells are always ringing.</p>

<p>Sharing a personal anecdote, Thakur said that her father recently told her to settle down. In response, she requested him to call his sister and ask if she knows a good guy for his daughter. &ldquo;He asked, &lsquo;Where is the guy?&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;Exactly, where is the guy?&rsquo; If you&rsquo;re asking me this, what should I say then? This is every household&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; she shared with the publication.</p>

<p>During the candid conversation about marriage and life partners, the Jersey actress mentioned that she is not scared of arranged marriage at all. But it&rsquo;s that there simply aren&rsquo;t any matches for her. She thinks marriage isn&rsquo;t something one should do just for the sake of it. Unlike earlier, now even friends set people up. No matter what form of arrangement it is, love or arranged, if two people connect and click, that&rsquo;s what counts; otherwise, nothing works for her.</p>

<p>While the two prospective partners need to connect, it&rsquo;s also important for the families to agree too. &ldquo;Because marriage is not just between a man and a woman, it&rsquo;s between two families. If everyone is on board, then why not?&rdquo; concluded Mrunal.</p>

<p>On the work front, Mrunal&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/do-deewane-seher-mein-teaser-out-siddhant-chaturvedi-mrunal-thakurs-imperfectly-perfect-love-story-to-release-on-valentines-day-1400032">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a> hit cinemas today.

Having said that, the unnamed source acknowledged the fact that, owing to the screenwriter and the Khan family&rsquo;s popularity, the public is curious to know about his well-being.</p>

<p>However, &ldquo;medical information is a confidential matter. The family wants to avoid any unnecessary speculation or media scrutiny surrounding Salim Khan&rsquo;s condition,&rdquo; the source added.</p>

<p><strong>Doctor&rsquo;s update on Salim Khan&rsquo;s health</strong></p>

<p>The doctor from Lilavati Hospital shared that a Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) procedure was performed by a neurosurgeon on Salim Khan. He also informed, &ldquo;The procedure has been accomplished, he is fine, he is stable, he is being shifted to the ICU, and by tomorrow (February 19), I think we will get him off the ventilator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The healthcare provider underlined that the senior star has been doing quite well. &ldquo;Age is a factor we understand, that is why the process of recovery takes a little time,&rdquo; he divulged.</p>

<p>On the day of his hospitalization, the doctors saw him in the casualty. They later took him to the ICU. According to the hospital authorities, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salim-khan-hospitalised-salman-khan-alvira-agnihotri-aayush-sharma-and-other-family-members-visit-him-1400817">Salman Khan</a>&rsquo;s father was having jerks, and his blood pressure was high. Since they wanted to do certain investigations on him, they put him on the ventilator.</p>

<p>Since then, Salman, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salim-khan-hospitalised-sohail-khan-arrives-with-seema-nirvaan-to-see-father-salma-khan-helen-sshura-join-1400855">Sohail Khan</a>, Arpita Khan Sharma, Alvira Agnihotri, Nirvaan Khan, Aayush Sharma, Helen, Salma Khan, and other family members have arrived at the hospital to meet him.

Over the years, he has spoken openly about his son&rsquo;s personality, career choices, and life decisions, highlighting both his strengths and vulnerabilities. Through his words, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/is-salim-khan-admitted-to-the-icu-heres-what-we-know-about-salman-khans-father-1400823">legendary writer</a> has spoken of his pride, concern, and affection he holds for his eldest son Salman, reflecting a bond built on tough love, guidance, and unwavering care. Here are his top five statements about the superstar.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. On their relationship and father-son bond</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;If he does something I don&#39;t like or I feel that he has done something wrong, then I don&#39;t talk to him... <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khans-father-salim-khan-admitted-to-hospital-heres-what-we-know-1400816">Salman</a> has had it the worst from me, particularly since he is the eldest among them&quot;.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Salman Khan&rsquo;s unchanged nature and stardom after Maine Pyar Kiya</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;When I saw his first film, I knew that he had all the qualities of a star, 100 percent. But I also knew his nature; he never took anything seriously. I knew he would become a star 100 percent, but I also knew that if anyone can harm him, it is Salman himself&quot;.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Why Salman Khan remains unmarried</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;He desires a life partner like his mother, someone deeply devoted to family, who manages the household and cooks for everyone&mdash;an expectation I admit is difficult in today&#39;s times&quot;. He further noted that when Salman commits, &quot;he tries to convert them and looks for his mother in them. That is not possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Helping others before himself</strong><br />
<br />
&quot;All his scripts that go wrong are because he tries to accommodate his friends, who have no work. He helps selflessly. He doesn&#39;t expect loyalty. He believes God is the giver&quot;.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Controversies</strong><br />
<br />
&ldquo;He is not a criminal. He may be impulsive, but he is not a bad human being.&rdquo;</p>

Over the past decades, the actor with no film background, has worked with many B-town biggies and is now in their close friends&rsquo; group. In an interview, John expressed that he gets along with his male co-stars be it Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar or Abhishek Bachchan.</p>

<h3><strong>John Abraham on his equation with male co-stars</strong></h3>

<p>From his 2003 debut film Jism to his recent outing Tehran, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-john-abraham-admits-wasting-time-in-school-claims-hrithik-roshan-was-fantastic-dancer-even-then-i-did-nothing-1378495">John Abraham</a> has proved his mettle as an ace actor. Over the past decades, he has created a strong bond, especially with his male co-stars because he has trained his mind to think that he is not competing but complementing them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I get along way better with my male co-stars,&rdquo; John told SCREEN, adding that he has shared the screen with many big names including Akshay Kumar, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shah-rukh-khan-responsible-where-i-am-says-pathaan-co-star-john-abraham-1058948">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Varun Dhawan, and Abhishek Bachchan. &ldquo;I have even kissed Abhishek,&rdquo; the Dhoom actor humorously revealed.</p>

<p>While he looks at his contemporaries as people who complement&nbsp;his process, they also look at him the same way. Hence, he is not competitive in that space. &ldquo;I am very comfortable around guys, and that beauty shows in the film,&rdquo; expressed the National Award-winning actor.</p>

<p>With so many hit movies to his credit, John has made it clear that he belongs in Bollywood. However, when he started in 2003, he&rsquo;s probably been criticized the most in this industry. In the same interview, Abraham spilled, &ldquo;The amount of criticism I have gone through, nobody else has faced that in my time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the hate, scrutiny and negativity didn&rsquo;t impact him or his work because John adopted a very simple method, to behave like a horse with blinkers. This way, he could only see in front. Unlike many Bollywood actors, he refrained from having a publicist. While he assumes this routine could make him vulnerable &ldquo;but I think people know my integrity and where I come from,&rdquo; the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-john-abraham-drops-major-hint-about-prequel-to-shah-rukh-khans-pathaan-with-jims-backstory-it-looks-interesting-1378603">Pathaan</a> actor concluded.</p>

The actor has been granted short-term release till March 18, 2026. While talking to the media, his brother Chandrapal Yadav took a sigh of relief stating that the good days are in the offing.

<h3><strong>Rajpal Yadav gets relief</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyadarshan-wants-to-save-rajpal-yadav-says-poor-guy-erred-due-to-less-education-i-knew-about-his-problem-1400737">Rajpal Yadav</a> has been finally granted short-term relief on Monday. This means, the actor will be released for a month and he will be staying out till March 18, 2026. After the news came out, his brother Chandrapal Yadav expressed happiness to the media.</p>

<p>Hindustan Times quoted him saying, “Hume kisi se koi shikayat nahi nahi hai. Jo bhi din the woh humare din the, ab humare achhe din aane wale hai. Abhi bas yehi kahenge. (We have no complaints from anyone. Whatever days we had, our good days are yet to come. That is all we will say for now.)”</p>

<p>According to reports, the relief came after the Chup Chup Ke actor deposited a sum against the amount that he is supposed to pay. He will now be able to attend the wedding of his niece on February 19, 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Celebs lend their helping hands to Rajpal Yadav</strong></p>

<p>Many Bollywood celebs came forward to help him. Among the first was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sonu-sood-gurmeet-choudhary-offer-financial-help-to-rajpal-yadav-urge-producers-to-come-forward-1400619">Sonu Sood</a> who promised to offer work to Rajpal and pay him the signing amount when needed. Next up was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-salman-khan-in-talks-with-the-family-man-makers-raj-and-dk-for-action-comedy-film-1399659">Salman Khan</a> who came forward to offer financial help to Yadav. However, the exact amount has not been publicly disclosed.</p>

<p>Ajay Devgn, Varun Dhawan, Gurmeet Choudhary and Mika Singh and Guru Randhawa were among the others who pledged to help the Phir Hera Pheri actor.</p>

<p>For the unaware, Yadav had taken a loan in 2010 to produce a film. But sadly, it didn’t do well, leading to him losing money. Even though he issued multiple cheques to pay the amount, most of them bounced. Hence, the matter further escalated.</p>

What initially appeared to be a potential mega collaboration has now been linked to a behind-the-scenes effort to address the ongoing dispute between actor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/from-7-vanity-vans-to-no-bound-scripts-is-this-why-ranveer-singh-and-farhan-akhtar-had-a-fallout-over-don-3-1400610">Ranveer Singh</a> and Farhan Akhtar&rsquo;s production house. According to HT City, Aamir took the initiative to help both sides find common ground amid escalating tensions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Aamir Khan steps in to ease Don 3 clash</strong><br />
<br />
Among those spotted at the gathering were Karan Johar, Sajid Nadiadwala, Ektaa Kapoor, Ritesh Sidhwani, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-farhan-akhtar-decides-to-move-on-from-don-3-plans-to-bring-back-jee-le-zara-with-priyanka-chopra-katrina-kaif-and-alia-bhatt-1400284">Farhan Akhtar</a>, Zoya Akhtar, and Punit Goenka. While the agenda remained confidential at first, reports suggest that one of the primary discussions centered on resolving the high-profile fallout linked to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/don-3-hrithik-roshan-puts-an-end-to-rumors-of-him-replacing-ranveer-singh-says-i-was-never-approached-1400706">Don 3</a>. According to Hindustan Times, &ldquo;Aamir is trying to resolve the issues between Ranveer Singh and Excel Entertainment. The two have had some unresolved issues, which have caught the eye. The meetings at his place are for the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to several reports, the conflict began after Ranveer Singh exited from Don 3, after putting forward a demand of Rs. 40 crore from the production company. The production house claims substantial pre-production expenses, scheduling disruptions, and related financial setbacks were incurred with the actor&rsquo;s approval. The matter was then taken to the Producers Guild of India for them to step in as the mediator.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s Stand</strong><br />
<br />
Ranveer had reportedly mentioned that he neither accepted an advance nor was provided with a finalized bound script, citing creative dissatisfaction and concerns about project management. He has also pointed out that he was not compensated for time lost when other films were shelved. With Aamir now reportedly attempting to act as the peacemaker, the industry waits to see whether this intervention can bring closure to one of the Hindi film industry&rsquo;s most talked-about standoffs.</p>

During a recent interview with Zoom, the actress opened up about her decision to reject the role of Tina Malhotra, which first came to her before going to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-reveals-how-mrs-chatterjee-vs-norway-helped-her-after-miscarriage-my-sense-of-loss-1400312">Rani Mukerji</a> and becoming a career hit. alongside <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/throwback-when-shah-rukh-khans-fans-sneaked-in-and-stayed-in-superstars-bungalow-for-8-hours-1400233">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and Kajol. She has spoken about not wanting to restart her acting career while already being successful with other films.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ranveena Tandon clarifies her decision not to accept Kuch Kuch Hota Hai with SRK</strong></p>

<p>Recalling how her close friend Karan Johar was upset due to her call to decline the role, she shared, &ldquo;I had my reasons to reject certain films. For example, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Karan always says that you didn&rsquo;t do my first film, but I tell him that I would have loved to do it, and you are my friend, but unfortunately, during that time in my career, I couldn&rsquo;t have restarted my career by playing second lead after leaving at a point which was Mohra.&quot;</p>

<p>She further explained that she eyed a different career path for herself, one which allowed her to do more films as a solo star that plays the second fiddle in someone else&rsquo;s story, &ldquo;It was very necessary for me to start off, even if I have five scenes and five songs, but as a solo heroine. I had to restart my career like that, which was very difficult, but I was like &lsquo;you have to do this&rsquo;.&rdquo; She also noted that Kuch Kuch Hota Hai worked for Rani Mukerji because she was a &lsquo;fresh face&rsquo; and so was not the case for her.&nbsp;</p>

During the time, she worked with male co-stars like Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Anil Kapoor, Arbaaz Khan, and Sanjay Kapoor, who became her buddies. But back in the day, the actress was s**t shamed for befriending male actors. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Raveena Tandon on being shamed for befriending male actors</strong></h3>

<p>In an interview with Zoom, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/raveena-tandon-movies-1303912">Raveena Tandon</a> shared that she has been authentic throughout her career. From sending birthday cakes to her female co-stars like Juhi Chawla to sharing a friendly bond with her male co-stars, she has always shared a comfortable space with her buddies and never saw any difference between men and women.</p>

<p>But there was a time when she was s**t shamed for having male actors as her pals. In the interview, the Patthar Ke Phool debutant expressed that most of her heroes were her buddies, and she never saw that difference. But according to her, some magazines and publications were narrow-minded. &ldquo;Because when you befriended a boy, you were s**t shamed, just because a boy is your friend,&rdquo; stated the senior actress.</p>

<p>Having said that, Tandon underscored that even today, all those boys are still her best friends, whether it be Sanjay Kapoor, Arbaaz Khan, or anyone else. But the judgement and the shaming sent her into a shell, after which she stopped socializing, meeting people, or even leaving her house.</p>

<p><strong>Raveena Tandon&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Raveena is a part of Ahmad Khan&rsquo;s upcoming multi-starrer movie, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ahmad-khan-calls-welcome-to-the-jungle-dark-situational-humor-confirms-release-date-1398449">Welcome to the Jungle</a>.

The movie will also feature actors like Suniel Shetty, Arshad Warsi, Paresh Rawal, Disha Patani, Tusshar Kapoor, Johnny Lever, Puneet Issar, and several others.</p>

<p>She will also be returning to Tamil cinema after 24 years with Vijay Antony&rsquo;s upcoming film, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/lawyer-raveena-tandon-makes-powerful-return-to-kollywood-alongside-vijay-antony-after-24-years-1389111">Lawyer</a>.&nbsp;The film&rsquo;s director, Joshua Sethuraman, told TOI that he reached Raveena through his Bollywood friends. &ldquo;I told her that she&rsquo;d get an idea of my work once she sees Gentlewoman, my debut film. After she saw it, I immediately narrated this film&rsquo;s story, and she was also interested,&rdquo; expressed the filmmaker.</p>

Reflecting on Singh&rsquo;s decision, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap says he was tired of singing the same thing again and again. Read on!</p>

<p>Kennedy filmmaker <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/anurag-kashyap-says-hindi-film-industry-thinks-of-him-as-bad-news-finds-acceptance-and-non-judgemental-love-in-the-south-1395977">Anurag Kashyap</a> recently spoke about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/arijit-singh-announces-retirement-from-playback-singing-i-am-calling-it-off-it-was-a-wonderful-journey-1400254">Arijit Singh</a>&rsquo;s decision to step away from playback singing. While talking to Tried &amp; Refused Productions, the actor-director stated that he announced his retirement because &ldquo;he was tired of singing the same thing again and again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anurag said that playback isn&rsquo;t the only thing Singh has been doing. The singer recently debuted as a music composer with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-mrs-star-sanya-malhotra-recalls-seeing-shah-rukh-khan-for-1st-time-and-its-not-on-jawan-sets-mujhey-ek-mahina-1372404">Sanya Malhotra</a>&rsquo;s film, Pagglait.

Vo bahot kuch karna chahta hai (He wants to do a lot of things),&quot; added the Bombay Velvet director.</p>

<p>In the same interview, Kashyap spoke about the pressures that singers face in the industry. According to him, when the musicians are given the freedom and time, they will come out with something else. &ldquo;But if you restrict them by saying that the song must be a hit, every musician gets bound,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Talking about Arijit Singh&rsquo;s retirement, the ace singer took to his social media and made the official announcement. In his post, the singer who has lent his voice to movies like Ikkis, Border 2, O&rsquo;Romeo, and more expressed, &ldquo;Hello, Happy New Year to all. I want to thank you all for giving me so much of love all these years as listeners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added, &ldquo;I am happy to announce that I am not gonna be taking any new assignments as a playback vocalist from now on. I am calling it off. It was a wonderful journey.&rdquo; Apart from Bollywood, Singh also worked in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, and many other languages.</p>

But currently, the actor is in dire need of help, owing to the financial problems he is currently dealing with. So director Priyadarshan requested the producers of their next film to pay the actor more than he charges.</p>

<h3><strong>Priyadarshan extends his helping hand to Rajpal Yadav</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sonu-sood-gurmeet-choudhary-offer-financial-help-to-rajpal-yadav-urge-producers-to-come-forward-1400619">Rajpal Yadav</a> and filmmaker <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyadarshan-lauds-his-disciple-aditya-dhar-for-dhurandhars-mega-success-latter-bows-down-to-his-master-1399761">Priyadarshan</a> have collaborated in multiple movies together. Hence, over the past decades, they have created a special bond with each other. Looking at Yadav&nbsp;struggling&nbsp;with finances and spending his days behind bars, the director has decided to lend a helping hand to the actor. While talking to Mid-Day, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/paresh-rawal-on-hera-pheri-3-controversy-with-akshay-kumar-and-makers-the-film-without-babu-rao-will-be-a-disaster-1400275">Hera Pheri</a> helmer stated that he has known the actor for 20 years.</p>

<p>Hence, to save him from money trouble, he told the producers of their next film to pay him more. &ldquo;I told the producers [Jubilee Films] of my next to pay Rajpal more than what he charges because of his situation. We want to save him,&rdquo; stated Priyadarshan, adding that the producers have accepted his request. According to the director, Rajpal plays the villain in their next project.</p>

<p>Apparently, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bhooth-bangla-new-release-date-akshay-kumar-starrer-prepones-premiere-to-april-10-2026-1400547">Bhooth Bangla</a> maker knew about the Bhool Bhulaiyaa actor&rsquo;s problem. Hence, he kept signing Rajpal for every film and even pushed him in ad films too. &ldquo;The poor guy made a blunder because of his poor education. Rajpal is a good soul,&rdquo; expressed the ace Indian filmmaker.</p>

<p>The first time they worked together was in the 2000 film Jungle. Priyadarshan was surprised by his performance. Their first film together was Malamaal Weekly, and after that, Rajpal starred in most of his films. According to reports, Priyadarshan&rsquo;s next movie is a comic caper starring Pankaj Tripathi and Rajpal Yadav.</p>

<p>Currently, Priyadarshan is busy with the post-production of his upcoming film, Bhooth Bangla. The comedy horror film stars Akshay Kumar, Paresh Rawal, Rajpal Yadav, Tabu, and Wamiqa Gabbi. Bankrolled by Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor,&nbsp;and Akshay Kumar, the movie is scheduled for a theatrical release on April 10, 2026.</p>

The duo that has been rumored to be dating for a while now has a new update to excite their fans, as the actress was recently asked about her plans to get married and shared that it is indeed something she looks forward to in life. However, she added that she has yet to meet the right person for the same, essentially shutting down the speculations.</p>

<p><strong>Mrunal Thakur opens up on wanting to marry for love amid Dhanush dating rumors</strong></p>

<p>She told PTI, &quot;Yes, wedding is on the cards, and whenever the right day, the right time, and the right person walks into my life, I will be the first one to announce it on my social networking sites.&rdquo; The 33-year-old wishes to get married for love and nothing else, which she hinted at while adding, &ldquo;Earlier, people might have had certain reasons to get married, but today, people marry because they want to, and they want to do it with the right person.&quot;</p>

<p>This remark follows a day after the actress shared her stance on the ongoing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/mrunal-thakur-dismisses-marriage-rumors-with-dhanush-i-think-14th-feb-is-going-to-be-april-fools-day-1400694">February 14 wedding rumors</a>. Previously, she was asked to comment on the possible Valentine&rsquo;s Day plans for her nuptials, and the actress was quick to rest the doubts during a chat with Galatta Plus by poking fun at the possibility, &ldquo;Me? No. I think&hellip;14th Feb is going to be the 1st April. April Fools&#39; Day. Because I don&rsquo;t know who started&hellip;First of all. I&rsquo;ve been quoted, but I never said anything. And they just said, Mrunal said so. I was like, wow, how beautiful. It&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the two stars have never admitted to being in a relationship, their sightings together have only encouraged the onlookers to believe that they&rsquo;re dating. However, the two have remained tight-lipped and low-key.</p>

Each time, he dips out of view, building anticipation with every beat. Then comes the pause. A knowing smile. And the line: &ldquo;Main sirf ek cheez chahta hun&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
Early chatter online suggests fans are already in guessing mode, speculating about what the &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; could be &nbsp;and whether the date is more than a coincidence.<br />
Is it something heartfelt? Something playful? Or something entirely unexpected?<br />
For now, the mystery remains sealed. But if there&rsquo;s one date that now carries extra curiosity, it&rsquo;s February 14, 2026.</p>

<br />
Aruna Irani is today a known face in the entertainment industry. But when she decided to step into the acting realm, she had to knock on every possible door to get any kind of work to pay her bills. At that time, she met Mehmood, who helped her get a much-deserved break. However, the veteran actress alleges she was exploited by the legendary comedian.</p>

<p><strong>Aruna Irani says Mehmood exploited her</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/meet-actor-arun-irani-whose-affair-with-mehmood-ruined-her-career-secretly-married-a-filmmaker-and-said-no-to-adult-scene-with-rishi-kapoor-1393128">Aruna Irani</a> is a positive and happy-go-lucky woman who takes life as it comes. While she comes across as a carefree bird, there was a time in her life when all she wanted was to make money and support her family. During the inception of her career, she met with ace Bollywood actor and comedian Mehmood, who helped her, a struggling newcomer, get work in the film industry.</p>

<p>However, during an interview with Zoom, the Suhaag actress revealed that the relationship sustained for a while because she was burdened by his favors. &ldquo;Vo relationship ek alag tareeke se ban gayi. Main ehsaan ke neeche dabi hui thina (That relationship bloomed because I was indebted to him),&rdquo; the actress expressed, adding that before him, she had never seen a man in her life.</p>

<p><strong>Aruna Irani on career setback</strong></p>

<p>After working with the Padosan actor and with his support, she finally started getting work. As she got busy with work commitments, she realized that she was exploited by the late actor. &ldquo;Mujhe&nbsp;lagne laga Mehmood sahab mujhe&nbsp;openly exploit kar rahe hai. (I felt that Mehmood was openly exploiting me),&rdquo; she divulged.</p>

<p>Having said that, the veteran actress doesn&rsquo;t want to put the entire blame on him, as she also started her association with him when she was in dire need of help and support. However, during their relationship, he promised to get married to her. But now she thinks &ldquo;mere naseeb achhe&nbsp;the&nbsp;(I was lucky)&rdquo; to have not married him. In fact, Mehmood would tell people that they were already in wedlock.</p>

<p>This added to her misery as no one gave her work. People thought that if they had a child, their movies would get stalled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I had a lot of setbacks,&rdquo; she opined. But when this story ended, and she started working outside, people found out that there was no truth to the rumors. This brought all the focus from her personal life to her professional life.<br />

He also patted Shanaya&rsquo;s back for convincingly playing Miss Vanity. Next up, he appreciated Adarsh for brilliantly portraying the gully boy and the traumatised victim of the reptile&rsquo;s attack. Towards the end, Karan gave &ldquo;badhai&rdquo; to film producer Anand L. Rai and Vinod Bhanushali for bankrolling Tu Yaa Main, calling it a &ldquo;cracker of a clutter breaker.&rdquo;</p>

After Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s exit from the upcoming actioner, rumors of Hrithik Roshan replacing him spread like wildfire. Now, Hrithik has finally cleared the air, confirming that he was never approached for Don 3.</p>

<h3><strong>Hrithik Roshan is not replacing Ranveer Singh in Don 3</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/hrithik-roshan-spills-the-beans-about-his-first-production-venture-storm-with-hrx-films-calls-it-a-great-exercise-to-judge-his-worth-as-an-actor-1400520">Hrithik Roshan</a> got dragged into the Don 3 and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-walks-out-of-don-3-amidst-dhurandhar-success-hunt-for-a-new-don-begins-1399363">Ranveer Singh</a> controversy. Some reports mentioned that after Singh parted ways from the project, Roshan might be replacing him in Farhan Khan&rsquo;s actioner. When the rumors reached the Krrish&nbsp;actor, he decided to break his silence on the matter.</p>

<p>While talking to Variety India, Hrithik clarified that, unlike what&rsquo;s speculated, he is not replacing Ranveer in Don 3. The Fighter star expressed that what started off as just a rumour has now taken on&nbsp;a life of its own. Hence, it was important for him to set the record straight.</p>

<p>The actor told the publication, &ldquo;I would like to categorically clarify that I was never approached for Don 3 at any given time. I request the media to steer clear of any such unverified reports.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>About Don 3</strong></p>

<p>After the massive success of Don (2006) and Don 2 with Shah Rukh Khan, the makers announced Don 3 with Ranveer Singh. But after the record-breaking success of Dhurandhar, Singh reportedly parted ways from the project to focus on his upcoming movie, Pralay, with director Jai Mehta.</p>

<p><strong>Hrithik Roshan&#39;s work front</strong></p>

<p>As for Hrithik Roshan, the actor is all set to star in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-hrithik-roshan-turns-director-for-indias-biggest-superhero-franchise-krrish-4-to-be-produced-by-aditya-chopra-1379545">Krrish 4</a>, which will also mark his directorial debut. Rakesh Roshan exclusively informed Pinkvilla that he is passing the baton of directing Krrish 4 to his son. Hrithik has lived, breathed, and dreamt about this franchise since its inception with Rakesh. Hence, he couldn&rsquo;t be prouder to see his actor son wear the director&rsquo;s hat for a film that means the world to their family.</p>

<p>After acting and direction, Hrithik will also be stepping into production with his company, HRX Films. The actor has already announced <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/hrithik-roshan-spills-the-beans-about-his-first-production-venture-storm-with-hrx-films-calls-it-a-great-exercise-to-judge-his-worth-as-an-actor-1400520">Storm</a> as his first project.

A perfect blend of beauty and brains, she found her calling in books and has authored a bestseller. Read on to know more about Soha Ali Khan.</p>

<h3><strong>Meet actor Soha Ali Khan</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/soha-ali-khan-admits-being-replaced-in-paheli-after-shah-rukh-khan-came-on-board-how-do-i-pay-my-rent-1396923">Soha Ali Khan</a> is the daughter of former Indian cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan and actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/chhorii-2-actor-soha-ali-khan-reveals-mom-sharmila-tagore-was-familys-breadwinner-dad-mansoor-played-cricket-for-enjoyment-there-was-no-money-1381730">Sharmila Tagore</a>. Since her dad was the 9th Nawab of Pataudi, she would have been a princess if the royal titles had not been abolished. Before stepping into the acting realm, she graduated from Oxford and holds a master&#39;s degree in International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p>

<p>Upon her return, Soha took a bank job and was reportedly receiving an INR 2,20,000 per annum salary. According to Enrichest, her family&#39;s&nbsp;total wealth and assets are worth more than Rs 5000 crore.</p>

<p>But soon she left her bank job and stepped into the Indian film industry with a Bengali film, Iti Srikanta, back in 2004. The same year, she made her Hindi film debut with Shahid Kapoor in Dil Maange More.<em>&nbsp;</em>Despite doing multiple movies in Bollywood, her breakthrough came with the action-drama film Rang De Basanti, co-starring Aamir Khan, Siddharth, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor, R. Madhavan, and others.</p>

<p>She was next seen in movies like Tum Mile, Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns, Ghayal: Once Again, Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster 3, and an award-winning short film, Soundproof. Last year, Soha made the audience scream with her scary performance in Vishal Furia&rsquo;s Chhorii 2, along with Nushrratt Bharuccha.</p>

<p>Amid starring in films, hosting TV shows, and featuring in web shows, she also put pen to paper and came out with her debut novel, The Perils of Being Moderately Famous, in 2017. Categorized as a biography, the book was well accepted by readers. On the personal front, Soha is the sister of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/saif-ali-khan-confesses-to-being-jealous-of-kareena-kapoor-working-with-other-men-while-dating-naturally-insecure-1399167">Saif Ali Khan</a>, who was crowned the 10<sup>th</sup> Nawab of Pataudi at his birth.

<h3><strong>Salman Khan called Varun Dhawan amid Border 2 trolling</strong></h3>

<p>&ldquo;He (Salman Khan) was just laughing, and he said, &lsquo;Good things are about to come.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s all he told me,&rdquo; revealed Varun, adding that the superstar&rsquo;s advice and his belief meant a lot to him. Not just this, when the film became a hit, Salman called again to congratulate Varun. At that time, the Sultan actor told Dhawan that he was happy for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I am proud of you, beta&rsquo;. That was a defining moment because he doesn&rsquo;t praise people. He didn&rsquo;t need to do that, but he did, and it gave me confidence,&rdquo; stated the Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania actor. While addressing the audience, Varun underscored that it&rsquo;s important for him to talk about the incident and the generosity of Salman because the people who stand for him and support him are very important.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-calls-nick-jonas-best-decision-i-ever-made-in-romantic-update-shares-unseen-early-relationship-pics-1400530">Priyanka Chopra</a> is opening up about the unending questions around her marriage to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/nick-jonas-shares-first-reaction-to-priyanka-chopra-starrer-varanasi-with-mahesh-babu-calls-rajamoulis-next-big-film-1400607">Nick Jonas</a> and how many thought they were a performative couple. Having said their I dos back in 2018, the couple remains dedicated to their relationship, &quot;We&#39;re eight years in. If people want to keep waiting for it to implode, that&#39;s their choice. I stopped thinking about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, recalling the sheer number of comments they received, the actress remains unsure why the world did not accept them wholeheartedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what was it about us that rubbed people the wrong way,&rdquo; she said. Making a guess of the many possibilities, she added, &ldquo;I think there was the intercultural nature of it &mdash; different countries, different religions, age gap.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It did not affect her in the bigger scene of things, but it did start off as a painful thing to witness. &ldquo;It was very hurtful. And we both, instead of looking out, just sort of looked at each other, and we were like, &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; So it&rsquo;s like water off a duck&rsquo;s back now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The couple held two different ceremonies, honoring both their cultures, and welcomed their daughter <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-looks-back-at-beautiful-memories-as-she-hit-milestones-with-nick-jonas-and-maltie-marie-in-2025-video-1399575">Malti Marie</a>, via surrogacy, back in January 2022.</p>

While acknowledging that Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan have ruled the Bollywood space for many years now, he has admitted that many interesting actors have managed to give tough competition to the oldies. While calling everyone dispensable, he shared with Variety India, &ldquo;There will always be people who are better than you, more hardworking than you, more talented than you, who will come in and take your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Aamir Khan talks about new-gen actors who can replace the 3 Khans</strong></p>

<p>Recalling the moment he wanted Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan on screen during the former&rsquo;s cameo in the latter&rsquo;s film Pathaan, the 3 Idiots star shared how he understood the nuances of their scene and is sure many people did. However, he has emphasized that many young actors have what it takes to surpass the big three. &ldquo;Those same young actors have shown us that not only are they there [in the industry], they can give us a run for our money &mdash; Chhaava Vicky Kaushal, Animal Ranbir Kapoor, Dhurandhar Ranveer. They&rsquo;re there. They&rsquo;re very capable of taking over from us,&rdquo; he shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calling them talented actors, perhaps even more than the 3 Khans, he said that they&rsquo;re aiming for their rightful place in the industry. The new kids have proven their worth, says the 60-year-old. &ldquo;So they have answered without saying anything, they&rsquo;ve answered with their work. Which is fantastic. I really appreciate that. It&rsquo;s wonderful to see that.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, recently, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/aamir-khan-visits-arijit-singhs-home-whats-cooking-1400407">Aamir Khan</a>&rsquo;s nephew, actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/imran-khan-reveals-unhealthy-relationship-with-avantika-malik-led-to-divorce-separation-is-unpleasant-and-hurtful-1400428">Imran Khan</a>, shared that he thinks the 3 Khans should take on more <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/imran-khan-says-shah-rukh-khan-salman-khan-and-aamir-khan-can-not-play-leads-at-60-younger-generation-might-not-want-1400540">age-appropriate roles</a> and give way to younger stars who can be more relatable to the audience. &ldquo;The younger generation might not want to watch the story of a 70-year-old man,&rdquo; claimed the 43-year-old.</p>

Now, the director has revealed to Variety India that the stories for both projects are in progress; however, that&rsquo;s about it so far. He has not shared a detailed plan for the Sanjay Dutt-led comedy drama&#39;s plans to go on floors next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajkumar Hirani has revealed where the sequels for 3 Idiots and Munna Bhai 3 stand as of now. In a recent interview, he shared that the two films are being worked on at the moment. The Sanjay Dutt film already has two instalments, which were released in 2003 (Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.) and 2006 (Lage Raho Munna Bhai) respectively. As to where the third part stands, the director revealed, &ldquo;For Munna Bhai, I had an idea which is done to a larger level, but still, I haven&rsquo;t found the right end for it.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for the 3 Idiots sequel, which Pinkvilla was first to report about, the filmmaker has shared that an idea &lsquo;sparked up&rsquo; to him very recently. We also reported that the director had already locked the script and was set to bring in&nbsp;Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, R Madhavan, and Sharman Joshi after 15 years from the original. The director shared an update, &ldquo;I have three or four scripts with me at the moment, and I&rsquo;ll have to pretty quickly take a call on which way to walk now.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>About Rajkumar Hirani&rsquo;s upcoming projects</strong></p>

<p>Following their collaboration in blockbusters 3 Idiots (2009) and PK (2014), the two are set to join hands for a biographical film on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-aamir-khan-is-honoured-to-do-dadasaheb-phalke-with-rajkumar-hirani-says-its-drama-with-comedy-1392413">Dadasaheb Phalke</a>. The latest update remains that the film is yet to go on floors as the scripting work is still ongoing, post which they will plan the rest of the schedule. He will also reconvene with Ranbir Kapoor following the release of Sanju in 2018 for a biopic of an athlete; the project is on hold as of now, with reports suggesting it is being pushed to 2027.</p>

Actor eyes physically challenging role post SLB film]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1125951756_vicky-kaushal.webp"></img><p>Everyone has their eyes on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/vicky-kaushal-says-better-at-changing-diapers-than-acting-adds-it-was-tough-to-leave-son-for-outstation-gig-1399289">Vicky Kaushal</a>&rsquo;s next steps. Following the success of Chhava, the star has confirmed his appearance in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/will-vicky-kaushals-mahavatar-not-release-in-2026-due-to-love-and-war-real-reason-inside-1393396">Love &amp; War</a>, for which he&rsquo;s been filming alongside real-life couple Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt. As for his project after that, the 37-year-old will be working on Mahavatar, which is reportedly eyeing a release next year. The latest update from Mid-Day has revealed that the star would hop onto the pre-production prep for the film following the completion of his filming on the Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial.</p>

<p><strong>Vicky Kaushal gears up for Parshurama role, going on floors in October 2026</strong></p>

<p>It is known that Stree fame Amar Kaushik&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/mahavatar-vicky-kaushals-period-drama-on-chiranjeevi-parashurama-is-largest-film-we-have-ever-made-says-producer-dinesh-vijan-1385521">Mahavatar</a> will star Vicky Kaushal in the lead role of Chiranjeevi Parashurama, the sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu. While the excitement for the release has only just begun, the filming is still many months away. An insider has revealed that the delay may be because of his ongoing work, &ldquo;The actor cannot begin his physical prep as he is currently shooting Sanjay Leela Bhansali&rsquo;s Love &amp; War, in which he sports an athletic look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to where it goes from here, the source also shared the plans to set into the mythological portrayal by working on his physique, and here&rsquo;s the schedule known so far: &ldquo;For Mahavatar, he will need to build a heavy frame like that of a wrestler, complete with a rugged look and long, matted hair. After Love &amp; War reaches the finish line in April, the actor will adopt a new diet plan and workout regime to attain the required look.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Director Amar Kaushik searches for a female lead in Mahavatar</strong></p>

<p>Right now, it seems that the producer Dinesh Vijan and the filmmaker are focusing on the set building and other aspects of the story while awaiting the lead actor to join filming. Previously, it was rumored that Deepika Padukone would step in as the female star of the film, which has since been termed &lsquo;baseless&rsquo;. Hence, the hunt for the actor&rsquo;s counterpart continues.</p>

Recently, the Bollywood actor sat down for an interview and shared his side of the story. He dismissed infidelity allegations and claimed that he helped his son Yashvardhan&rsquo;s career. The actor also targeted Karan Johar for making Govinda Naam Mera on his name. Here are 5 internet-breaking statements that the actor made.</p>

<p><strong>Govinda dismisses cheating allegations</strong></p>

<p>In a recent interview with ANI, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/govinda-reacts-to-extramarital-affair-allegations-thanks-a-newcomer-for-staying-silent-amid-controversy-1400608">Govinda</a> opened up a can of worms as he spoke about all the controversies surrounding him. First up, he broke his silence about being accused of cheating by his wife, Sunita Ahuja. The Hero No. 1 actor stated that he is being accused by his childhood sweetheart, who is now taking names, alleging he is having an affair with a newcomer named Komal.</p>

<p>Dismissing the rumors, he thanked the unidentified woman (Komal) for staying silent on the matter and protecting his dignity. He also apologized to the newcomers, fearing they wouldn&rsquo;t want to work with him amid the raging controversy around his marital life.</p>

<p><strong>Govinda says he asked Sajid Nadiadwala to help his son Yashvardhan</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-interview-sunita-ahuja-breaks-silence-on-family-fight-between-govinda-and-krushna-abhishek-1398321">Sunita Ahuja</a> also accused her husband, Govinda for not helping with their son <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/govinda-breaks-silence-on-sunitas-claim-he-didnt-help-son-yashvardhans-career-i-asked-nadiadwala-he-gave-his-1400604">Yashvaradhan Ahuja</a>&rsquo;s career. However, Govinda was quick to call this statement baseless. The Partner star revealed to ANI that he asked Sajid Nadiadwala to guide their son and help him learn different aspects of filmmaking, which the producer did.</p>

<p><strong>Govinda slams Karan Johar</strong></p>

<p>In the same interview, Govinda spoke about the 2022 film, Govinda Naam Mera, directed by Shashank Khaitan and produced by Karan Johar. The senior actor claimed that Karan used his name in the film that showcases cheating among spouses.</p>

<p>Warning the filmmaker, Govinda said, &ldquo;Personal life mein kabhi kabhi kisi ki story ghusane ka prayaas karte hai. Kahin mere haath lag gaye toh Rajinikanth ke tarah itna prasaad dunga. Mazak har jagah par har tarah se achha nahi lagta hai. (They try to feed such stories into personal lives. If I ever meet him, I will give him Rajinikanth-style treatment.) I promise, no misbehave. I request with folded hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Govinda on the 23 intruders</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to ANI, the actor recalled watching a group of 23 people arriving. At first, he thought they belonged to his political party. But when he realized they were intruders, he captured their video and tried contacting the Mumbai Police, but in vain.</p>

<p>But soon, the situation got out of hand, and one of them climbed onto the terrace. Upon consulting his team, the actor&nbsp;confronted them. On being unsatisfied with their answer, Govinda pointed his weapon at them and asked them to leave his premises.</p>

<p><strong>Govinda responds to allegations of being late on sets</strong></p>

<p>In the same interview, Govinda clarified that he is being defamed by people who want to throw him out of the industry. The actor alleged some hero from the Hindi film industry is framing him, and many are pulling him down. He also recalled his assistant inquiring why everyone is bothered about him being late when many Bollywood stars, including Salman Khan and Sanjay Dutt, arrive late on sets.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;the entire development has come as a shock to his fans, netizens are also curious about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/rajpal-yadav-snatches-journalists-phone-on-being-asked-about-his-apology-for-diwali-firecracker-comment-watch-1356584">Rajpal Yadav</a>&#39;s financial condition and net worth.

Talking about his fees in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, he reportedly earned Rs 1.25 crore and received Rs 2 crore for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/chandu-champion-review-kartik-aaryan-goes-to-sarfira-heights-to-celebrate-great-murlikant-petkar-1316555">Chandu Champion</a>. Going by the reports circulating online, his net worth ranges from Rs 50 crore to Rs 80-85 crore. Publicly available information suggests that he usually charges Rs 1-2 crore per project.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/818535151_tamannaah-ragini-3-webp.webp"></img><p>Tamannaah Bhatia is reportedly set to star in the lead role in the upcoming film Ragini MMS 3. As the popular franchise gears up for a return, reports suggest that the film may be delayed and released later than initially expected.</p>

<p><strong>Tamannaah Bhatia starrer Ragini MMS 3 to get delayed?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Variety India, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-tamannaah-bhatia-to-spearhead-ragini-mms-3-for-ekta-kapoor-1395955">Ragini MMS 3</a> has been delayed and is currently on hold until further notice. Earlier, Sahir Raza, who has previously directed web series such as The Married Woman, Illegal - Justice, Out of Order, and more, was expected to helm the project.</p>

<p>However, the director has reportedly been removed from the film due to a scheduling conflict arising from his other professional commitments.</p>

<p>As per the report, Raza is currently serving as a showrunner on a Netflix series. A recent mandate from the streaming platform requires the showrunner&rsquo;s daily presence on set, making it difficult for him to juggle both projects.</p>

<p>With this development, producer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/ekta-kapoor-urges-content-creators-to-put-their-own-money-into-filmmaking-discusses-superboys-of-malegaon-and-the-buckingham-murders-box-office-failure-1378650">Ektaa Kapoor</a> is reportedly looking for a replacement director. However, this remains speculative for now, as no official confirmation has been made.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the upcoming instalment is expected to differ from the previous films in the franchise and explore stronger supernatural elements in its narrative.</p>

Two decades later, the Priyadarshan comedy thriller has become a cult classic. Well, the good news is that a sequel to the film is in the making. According to a news update, Paresh Rawal will be seen in a double role in Bhagam Bhag 2.</p>

<h3><strong>Paresh Rawal to play double role in Bhagam Bhag 2</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-hera-pheri-3-producers-sue-paresh-rawal-for-rs-25-crore-for-unprofessional-attitude-1388504">Paresh Rawal</a> was among the impressive ensemble cast of Bhagam Bhag, who made the audience laugh out loud. The makers of Bhagam Bhag 2 have roped him in to play a key character. But recently, Bollywood Hungama reported that the senior star will be playing not one, but two characters in the upcoming comedy flick. While talking to the publications, Rawal confirmed the same, &ldquo;Yes, I do. I am excited. Maza aayega. Dhamaal hoga!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Back in 2024, a source exclusively informed Pinkvilla, &ldquo;Hera Pheri, Bhagam Bhag and&nbsp;Garam Masala are three of the most special films for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/akshay-kumar-and-akshaye-khanna-to-reunite-onscreen-for-bhagam-bhag-2-heres-what-we-know-1399115">Akshay Kumar</a>, and he has already sorted out the franchise rights for Hera Pheri and Bhagam Bhag.&rdquo; While Akshay and Paresh are positively part of the sequel, Govinda is reportedly not in the movie. Apparently, he has been replaced by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/manoj-bajpayee-and-neeraj-pandey-take-down-promotional-material-of-ghooskhor-pandat-following-backlash-i-respect-the-emotions-and-concerns-1400509">Manoj Bajpayee</a>.</p>

<p>Talking about the casting change, Paresh stated that it will make for a different and unique combination. Having said that, he admitted missing Govinda. BB 2 will also star Meenakshi Chaudhary. If reports are to be believed, the upcoming comedy movie will be directed by Raaj Shaadilyaa, and the makers will be kickstarting filming from next month in Mumbai.</p>

<p><strong>Paresh Rawal&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>On the work front, Paresh Rawal is set to share screen with Akshay Kumar in multiple movies, starting with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bhooth-bangla-new-release-date-akshay-kumar-starrer-prepones-premiere-to-april-10-2026-1400547">Bhooth Bangla</a>, scheduled for a theatrical release on April 10, 2026. Next up, the stars will be seen together in Welcome to the Jungle.

<p>Recently, Rawal revealed that due to differences between the producers and Akshay, the film is getting delayed. The Padma Shri recipient told The Comedy Factory that if the issue between them gets resolved, he will sign the papers. &ldquo;Nothing to do with me, but it will happen 100 percent,&rdquo; confirmed the actor.</p>

While speculation about the film and its production has been ongoing, it appears a clash may have occurred between the lead actor and director-producer Farhan Akhtar.</p>

<p><strong>Did Ranveer Singh and Farhan Akhtar clash over Don 3?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Bollywood Hungama, the fallout between <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-dhurandhar-2-locks-a-massive-deal-ranveer-singh-and-aditya-dhar-film-gets-rs-245-crore-non-theatrical-deal-1400521">Ranveer Singh</a> and Farhan Akhtar led to meetings held in the presence of the Producers Guild of India (GUILD), involving several influential industry figures.</p>

<p>The second meeting reportedly took place on February 7, with Aamir Khan, Siddharth Roy Kapur, Ramesh Taurani, Kumar Taurani, and other key industry stakeholders in attendance.</p>

<p>At the meeting, an anonymous producer reportedly stated that Ranveer had blamed Excel Entertainment for unprofessionalism and for not being serious about beginning <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-walks-out-of-don-3-amidst-dhurandhar-success-hunt-for-a-new-don-begins-1399363">Don 3</a>. He said that Ranveer claimed Farhan never had a bound script in place and that, as an actor, he preferred to work only with fully developed material.</p>

<p>The producer added that Ranveer had also pointed out that Akhtar was never open to feedback on the script and had difficulty incorporating certain subplots. The actor further alleged that Excel had been exploring the possibility of bringing Hrithik Roshan on board and had reapproached him only after the success of Dhurandhar to capitalise on the momentum.</p>

<p>Moreover, the report indicated that Ranveer&rsquo;s team claimed the actor had endured nearly three years of indecision, alleging that Farhan was focused on multiple commitments, including his acting career, while Don 3 remained creatively underdeveloped. They also added that the script did not match Ranveer&rsquo;s stature.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-farhan-akhtar-decides-to-move-on-from-don-3-plans-to-bring-back-jee-le-zara-with-priyanka-chopra-katrina-kaif-and-alia-bhatt-1400284">Farhan Akhtar</a> apparently highlighted issues with Ranveer&rsquo;s temperament and demands. He reportedly presented documents to counter claims of script dissatisfaction. He maintained that Ranveer had never flagged any issues with the script and, in fact, had been enthusiastic about portraying the third generation of Don after Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan. He claimed that the script had been shared at regular intervals and approved by the Lootera actor at every stage.</p>

<p>Apparently, due to Singh&rsquo;s departure from the project, the makers incurred losses of Rs 40 crore, despite the producers having agreed to several of his demands. Farhan and Ritesh are now reportedly seeking reimbursement and have urged producers&rsquo; bodies to frame resolutions against what they describe as &ldquo;unreasonable star demands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, Ranveer was upset with how a mega film like Don 3 was treated by the stakeholders and left the project due to what he perceived as the incompetence of the production team. He added that if there were issues even before the film went on floors, he could not imagine the extent of unprofessionalism that might have occurred on set, choosing sanity over a compromised project.</p>

The biggest highlight was the wife alleging that the veteran superstar is having an extramarital affair with a young girl. Dismissing the allegations, Govinda thanked a newcomer for staying silent amid the burning controversy. Read on for more details.</p>

<h3><strong>Govinda dismisses allegations of extramarital affair</strong></h3>

<p>In multiple interviews, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ssunita-ahuja-reacts-to-govindas-alleged-affair-with-a-marathi-actress-this-is-not-the-age-to-do-all-of-this-1398181">Sunita Ahuja</a> claimed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sunita-ahuja-reveals-how-govindas-affair-rumors-affected-children-tina-and-yash-yeh-tumhari-umar-nahi-hai-1400007">Govinda</a> is involved with another woman, reportedly an upcoming actress. She has accused the Hero no. 1 actor of cheating and infidelity. The actor has finally opened up about the allegations, and during a chat with ANI, the Indian artist stated that he has often been accused. But this time, the person who is accusing him is his childhood sweetheart.</p>

<p>Defending himself, the Partner star noted that in the past decades, he worked with superstars and Miss Universe heroines. But no one can claim that he disturbed them or used foul language. Having said that, he quickly pointed at Sunita taking the names of women she thinks he is in a relationship with.</p>

<p>Govinda expressed, &ldquo;Now she is taking the name. I don&#39;t like such words. Isiliye mai shama maangta hu meri jo newcomers hai taki mai sabke saath kaam karu. Kahi dar na jaaye ki iske saath kaise kaam karna hai iske production mein kaam hi nahi karenge (I apologize to my newcomers because I want to work with them. I don&#39;t want them to be afraid of working with me or in my production.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further thanked a person named Komal for staying silent and saving him. &ldquo;Ye jo naam le rahi Komal main dhanyavad deta hu ki jo main aaj saved hu vo ek bhi shabd bahi bolti hai vo chup hai. (The name she is taking is Komal. I am thankful that she is not saying a word.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>For context, Sunit Ahuja was in an interview with Miss Malini, wherein she took a dig at interviewer Komal, alleging that the name is problematic and she doesn&rsquo;t like it. In the same chat, the Bollywood wife also alleged that Govinda hasn&rsquo;t helped their son, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/govinda-breaks-silence-on-sunitas-claim-he-didnt-help-son-yashvardhans-career-i-asked-nadiadwala-he-gave-his-1400604">Yashvardhan Ahuja</a>, with his career.</p>

The famed actor, born in the acting-heavy Kapoor family, is the son of Neetu Kapoor and the late <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/5-times-rishi-kapoor-spoke-about-son-ranbir-kapoor-from-calling-him-better-actor-to-admitting-they-are-poles-apart-1396443">Rishi Kapoor</a>. Speaking about his bond with his father, the star opened up about having a distant relationship, which is unlike what he wishes to build with his and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/pic-alia-bhatt-welcomes-2026-with-ranbir-kapoor-and-raha-on-a-serene-beach-getaway-1399639">Alia Bhatt</a>&rsquo;s own child, daughter Raha.</p>

<p><strong>Ranbir Kapoor is unlike father, Rishi Kapoor, while parenting Raha</strong></p>

<p>Bollywood actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranbir-kapoor-alia-bhatt-and-vicky-kaushals-love-and-war-pushed-to-2027-sanjay-leela-bhansali-to-wrap-shoot-in-june-1400028">Ranbir Kapoor</a> is changing the narrative for his family with a closer bond built with his daughter Raha. In a recent chat about legacies and bringing change, the actor shared, &ldquo;You know, my father&rsquo;s relationship with me, there was a little bit of a distance. There was not like a, friendship. That&rsquo;s how that generation was.&ldquo; (sic) As his fellow chair agreed that there was indeed a little bit of a difference between the two generations, the actor called it a &lsquo;glass wall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>However, the actor does not want to let the trend continue with his and Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s child, Raha Kapoor. &ldquo;With my child, I definitely want to break that glass wall. I want to be a friend to her&hellip;and give her the wings to fly, in whichever direction she likes,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same conversation, the 43-year-old opened up about the pressure of leading the legacy left by his ancestors, and shared that while the predecessors&#39; laurels exist, they have to be built upon with an individualistic approach for anyone new trying to follow the path.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Rishi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor</strong></p>

<p>Rishi Kapoor, a popular actor from the 1970s onwards, has had multiple hits under his name. With a successful career and marriage to Neetu Singh, he welcomed Ranbir Kapoor and Riddhima Kapoor. The son went on to become a known name in the industry before the star passed away at the age of 67. Now, Ranbir continues his father&rsquo;s heritage with bold roles and big films.&nbsp;</p>

He revealed how a production goof-up led to an explosive confrontation with late legendary choreographer Saroj Khan. Speaking in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter India, Karan admitted that his experience working with Saroj Khan left him deeply shaken, confessing that he was &ldquo;traumatized&rdquo; by her reaction and firmly believed that she never liked him.<br />
<br />
<strong>When Karan Johar faced Saroj Khan&#39;s anger</strong><br />
<br />
At the time, Karan was working as an assistant to director Aditya Chopra on the iconic Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol starrer. The incident occurred during the filming of the song Mehendi Laga Ke Rakhna, when the production team suddenly realized they were short of red scarves meant for background dancers. With more dancers than available fabric, he attempted a quick fix to avoid delaying the shoot. He recalled, &ldquo;I, to save the situation, went to Jojo, Saroj ji&rsquo;s assistant, and very cleverly said, you know, Jojo, I think achha lagega (it will look good), unko bolo, apna ek haath pocket mein rakho (tell them to keep one hand in their pocket), stylish lagega, cool lagega (it will look cool, it will look stylish). Because I didn&rsquo;t have any more cloth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The workaround appeared successful until Saroj Khan arrived on set. Karan said she immediately sensed something was wrong. Recounting the moment, Karan said, &ldquo;She literally pushed me. She said, &lsquo;Tu jahaan jana chahe, ja, Goregaon ja, laal kapda la, warna main shoot nahi karungi&rsquo; (Go wherever you need to go, go to Goregaon, bring the red cloth, otherwise I will not shoot).&rdquo; Karan recalled, &ldquo;I still remember the visual of us running on the streets of Goregaon saying, &lsquo;Laal kapda! Laal kapda! (Red cloth! Red cloth!). I was scared for my life. I was traumatized, traumatized, you know, and she was really scary. Like, she was the best. She somehow did not like me. She never liked me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saroj Khan passed away at the age of 71 on July 3, 2020, following a cardiac arrest, leaving behind a towering legacy in Indian cinema.<br />

The Bollywood wife alleged that her husband might be having an affair with a young woman who is interested in his money and is also blackmailing her. In an interview, she also claimed that Govinda never helped their son Yashvardhan Ahuja&rsquo;s career. Now, the Hero No. 1 actor has responded to the accusations.</p>

<h3><strong>Govinda says he asked Sajid Nadiadwala to help Yashvardhan&#39;s career</strong></h3>

<p>While talking to ANI, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-interview-sunita-ahuja-breaks-silence-on-family-fight-between-govinda-and-krushna-abhishek-1398321">Govinda</a> expressed that he didn&rsquo;t want his political career to affect his family or have an adverse effect on his kids. Hence, he left politics for them. The veteran Bollywood actor also revealed asking O&#39;Romeo producer Sajid Nadiadwala to help kickstart his son&rsquo;s career. Apparently, Nadiadwala obliged his request and offered Yash his cabin to guide him, and further helped him learn different aspects of filmmaking.</p>

<p>Having said that, Govinda admitted that he wasn&rsquo;t asked for anything else. The Partner star divulged, &ldquo;Aur mujhse jada pucha nahi gaya (And no one consulted me much.) Aur aise ek mahol ghar mein taiyaar tha, ki jisme ki main rishtey mai na kaamyaab hun. (The environment at home was such that I am unsuccessful in the relationship.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>To refresh your memory, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ssunita-ahuja-reacts-to-govindas-alleged-affair-with-a-marathi-actress-this-is-not-the-age-to-do-all-of-this-1398181">Sunita Ahuja</a> spoke about Govinda not helping son Yash during an interview with Miss Malini. She claimed that her son is a self-made boy who hasn&rsquo;t taken help from his father. Despite being Govinda&rsquo;s son, he gave 90 auditions. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ask Govinda to call anyone. Govinda also never helped Yash,&rdquo; the celebrity claimed.</p>

<p>Sunita also recalled reprimanding Govinda for not helping their kids. &ldquo;I told Govinda that he has to support his son, but I don&rsquo;t understand his thinking. The company that he keeps is so bad, I don&rsquo;t know what they teach him. His own career is ruined,&rdquo; Sunita Ahuja told the publication.</p>

<p>As for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-govindas-son-yashvardhan-ahuja-set-for-acting-debut-in-a-love-story-directed-by-national-award-winner-sai-rajesh-1363450">Yashvardhan Ahuja</a>, he is expected to make his acting debut in a love story directed by Sai Rajesh and produced by Madhu Mantena with Allu Aravind and SKN Films.</p>

While the Sitaare Zameen Par actor is bankrolling the project, Deol&#39;s regular collaborator, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rajkumar-santoshi-in-talks-to-direct-sunny-deol-in-jaat-2-1398042">Rajkumar Santoshi </a>has directed this film. For the record, Sunny and Rajkumar Santoshi have previously worked in Ghayal, Ghatak, and Damini. Lahore 1947 will be their fourth collaboration. Speculations are rife that Santoshi is working on Ghatak 2 now. If it gets materialised, the iconic actor-director combo will reunite for the 5th film too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lahore 1947 is&nbsp;a Thursday release, which means it will have a benefit of 4-day long weekend. The film should aim to repeat the kind of hysteria Sunny Deol&#39;s 2023 Independence Day weekend release, Gadar 2, saw in its dream theatrical run. However, Lahore 1947 will not get a clean run at the box office, as multiple other players are also toying up to release their projects during the same weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Lahore 1947 is based on a popular Punjabi play, Jis Lahore Nai Vekhya, O Jamya E Nai, written by Asghar Wajahat. The movie has an ensemble star cast that includes, Preity Zinta, Shabana Azmi, Abhimanyu Singh, Karan Deol, and Ali Fazal. AR Rahman has composed the music while Javed Akhtar has penned the lyrics.&nbsp;</p>

Directed by Balu Mahendra, Sadma is among the finest Indian films that not only portrayed human emotions in a realistic way but also highlighted some of the hard-hitting topics of loneliness and mental health, which are now a part of mainstream cinema.</p>

<p>As the title says, the romantic drama is nothing less than a &lsquo;Sadma&rsquo; for the audience as its ending instantly makes you teary-eyed. You won&#39;t be able to walk away from the heightened emotions easily after watching what happens with the film&#39;s characters, Somu (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanth-x-kamal-haasan-film-to-be-slice-of-life-project-about-friendship-all-we-know-about-its-plot-1400548">Kamal Haasan</a>) and Nehalata/Reshmi (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/boney-kapoor-blames-baahubali-producers-for-the-rift-between-sridevi-and-ss-rajamouli-she-is-not-a-struggling-actor-1396548">Sridevi</a>), in the climax. Here&#39;s a look at one of the greatest endings of all time.</p>

<p>When Reshmi is cured of amnesia, she forgets everything that happened between her accident and her treatment. As she returns to her old life as Nehalata, she forgets how Somu took care of her and the moments they shared together when she was a patient. In that moment when Somu tries everything to remind her of their beautiful past, breaks you in tears, courtesy of the remarkable performances.</p>

<p>​In the heartwrenching climax scene of Sadma, when Nehalata (Reshmi) boards the train to return to her home, she sees a wounded man outside her window making faces, crying, calling her &lsquo;Reshmi&hellip; Reshmi&hellip;&rsquo; and doing weird actions. The wounded man wearing rotten clothes was none other than Somu, who was trying to remind her of him by making her favourite &lsquo;monkey&rsquo; faces, only to get disappointed. What further hurt was Nehalata thinking of him as some &lsquo;pagal&rsquo; (mad) beggar. She throws off some food outside and says, &lsquo;Le Kha le.&rsquo; Nehlata then says to her friend sitting next to her, &lsquo;Koi paagal lagta hai&hellip;&rsquo;. This was an ironic statement with respect to their past lives.</p>

<p>Though Somu doesn&#39;t lose his focus, he keeps making faces, does everything he can to remind her of the beautiful bond they once shared, only to fall down after hitting a pole at the railway station.</p>

<p>​While both Kamal Haasan and Sridevi performed well throughout the movie, its the climax performance of the Tamil actor which made it one of the most memorable endings of Indian cinema.</p>

<p>​If you haven&#39;t watched this film yet, it&#39;s time to experience this classic tale, which is a gold standard in itself of how a true tragic love story should be made.</p>

Shahid Kapoor, the one who played the former, shared how the famed director dropped the idea to have him appear in the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/anil-kapoor-reveals-how-ranbir-kapoor-felt-on-animal-sets-after-shamshera-tanked-sab-mujhe-dekh-rahe-hai-itni-badi-flop-1397565">Ranbir Kapoor</a> starrer. In a chat with Dainik Bhaskar, the actor revealed why it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet and if there&rsquo;s a possibility in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kabir Singh by Shahid Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor&rsquo;s Vijay Singh, almost appeared in the same frame; here&rsquo;s why it didn&rsquo;t happen</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shahid-kapoor-reveals-mira-rajput-asked-him-to-do-kabir-singh-said-people-love-to-see-you-in-messed-up-1248795">Shahid Kapoor</a> is opening up on the details of the almost-crossover that happened between the two titular stars of Vanga&rsquo;s most-talked-about characters. Sharing what was planned regarding his character <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/throwback-dyk-shahid-kapoors-kabir-singh-was-first-offered-to-ranveer-singh-who-rejected-it-because-it-was-too-dark-1399600">Kabir Singh</a>&rsquo;s cameo in the Ranbir Singh-led film in 2023, he said, &ldquo;Jab Animal bhi ban rahi thi (when Animal was being made), actually Sandeep had come to meet me. He wanted one scene of Kabir to be there in that, but woh ho nahi paaya (it couldn&rsquo;t happen). Toh unke mann mein ye thought tha. But wo ho nahi paaya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to why the plan never came to fruition, the 44-year-old claimed that each of their busy schedules and unavailability of dates, alongside other reasons, never made it possible. &ldquo;Wo dono characters unke hain, wo duniya unki hai. Toh unke saath unko jo man mein aayega karne ke liye, wo karenge. (Both those characters belong to him; that world is his. So whatever he feels like doing with them, he&rsquo;ll do),&quot; he added.</p>

<p>Previously, Sandeep Reddy Vanga shared on the Game Changers podcast that he did not wish to get into a zone of &lsquo;cameo desperacy.&rsquo; He was looking at the realistic impact of such a scene in Animal and realized that the entry of Kabir Singh would not keep it natural&nbsp;anymore. Hence, after being convinced about the cameo for a couple of days, he dropped the idea.</p>

Neither the actor nor the makers have officially addressed the development. Prakash Raj was earlier announced as an important part of the cast, and his association with the Prabhas-starrer had generated considerable excitement among fans.<br />
<br />
<strong>Did Prakash Raj exit from the film Spirit? Actor dismisses rumors</strong><br />
<br />
According to OTTplay, tensions reportedly arose during filming after disagreements over the interpretation and execution of a particular scene. Sources claim the exchange escalated into friction between Prakash Raj and director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/sandeep-reddy-vanga-continues-animal-tradition-drops-chilling-spirit-first-look-ft-prabhas-and-triptii-dimri-on-new-year-1399547">Sandeep Reddy Vanga</a>, eventually leading to the actor stepping away from the project. Additional speculation suggests that on-set issues and differences in working approach may have contributed to the fallout.</p>

<p>However now, Hindustan Times has reported that Prakash Raj is still very much a part of the Prabhas starrer. The actor said in an official statement,&nbsp;&ldquo;Some nonsense speculations these are. I am not aware of it.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<strong>Deepika Padukone&#39;s exit from Spirit</strong><br />
<br />
Spirit has already seen multiple casting changes prior to this development. The makers had initially considered <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/spirit-what-is-deepika-padukones-exit-controversy-from-prabhas-sandeep-reddy-vangas-film-and-how-did-triptii-dimri-bag-it-1389547">Deepika Padukone</a> for the female lead, but she reportedly exited the project following disagreements over remuneration and work schedules. Triptii Dimri was later brought on board opposite Prabhas.<br />
<br />
<strong>About the film Spirit</strong><br />
<br />
Produced by T-Series and Bhadrakali Pictures, Spirit remains one of the most talked-about pan-world projects, promising scale, intensity, and bold storytelling despite the ongoing speculation surrounding its cast. The film is slated for a theatrical release on March 5, 2027, and its first-look poster, unveiled on the new year&nbsp;drew massive attention for its intense visuals. The cast also includes Vivek Oberoi and Kanchana in supporting roles.<br />
<br />
<strong>Prakash Raj&#39;s work front</strong><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Prakash Raj will next be seen in Dacoit, starring Adivi Sesh and Mrunal Thakur, and is also part of Thalapathy Vijay&rsquo;s last film, Jana Nayagan. Reports further suggest that he may play a significant role in SS Rajamouli&rsquo;s upcoming film Varanasi, headlined by Mahesh Babu, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, and Prithviraj Sukumaran.</p>

I request everyone not to fall prey to misinformation,&rdquo; he wrote, urging people not to fall prey to misinformation.</p>

<p>Agni Dev played Indian domestic cricket until 2025 and featured in major tournaments such as the Ranji Trophy, Vijay Hazare Trophy, and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Representing Mizoram in the Ranji Trophy Plate division during the 2023-24 season, he emerged as the tournament&rsquo;s highest run-scorer. In a historic feat, he became the first cricketer in first-class history to score centuries in each of his first four matches. He has earned significant recognition for his exploits in the domestic cricket before shifting his focus to the United States.</p>

<p>Born in Detroit, Michigan, Agni Dev is eligible to represent USA cricket, which explains why his name may have been mistakenly linked to the PSL as an overseas associate player. By categorically denying the reports, he has reiterated that his immediate priority lies in building his career within the American cricket system and staying focused on his long-term professional ambitions.</p>

You kept me together when I had just lost my dad. You loved me and helped me through many tough days without even realizing. Your warm hugs and your laugh will always be part of my memories.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/513970472_raghav.webp"></img><p>Ramayana has become a&nbsp;topic of discussion among cinema lovers. It&rsquo;s already known that Ranbir Kapoor, Sai Pallavi, Yash, and Sunny Deol are a part of Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s upcoming epic saga. Now, reports suggest that Raghav Juyal has replaced Vikrant Massey to play the role of Meghanad. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Raghav Juyal replaces Vikrant Massey in Ramayana</strong></h3>

<p>Everyone has their eyes on Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ramayana-is-a-two-part-saga-with-a-simultaneous-shoot-of-350-days-with-ranbir-yash-sai-and-sunny-1307595">Ramayana</a>. The multi-starrer movie is expected to be a magnum opus owing to its promising cast. Now, Variety India has reported that 12th Fail actor Vikrant Massey has been replaced by The Ba***ds of Bollywood actor Raghav Juyal to play a key character in the upcoming mythological saga. According to the publication, Raghav has been brought on board to play the role of Meghanad, the eldest son of Ravana.</p>

<p>Having said that, his character will feature in Ramayana Part 2. For context, Ramayana is a two-part film. An insider exclusively informed Pinkvilla that, given the scale and magnitude of the film, the makers have opted for a two-part approach to tell the story. &ldquo;While most in the business await the results of part one before taking the second one on floors, Ramayana will be shot simultaneously,&rdquo; said the source close to the development.</p>

<p>Moreover, the team has chalked out a 350-day shoot schedule for the two Ramayana films, which will be released in one year span. Hence, Raghav has been roped in to play a key character in the second part of the film, which is expected to release around Diwali 2027. Since a major portion of Ramayana Part 2 will be shot even before the release of Part 1, Juyal could be joining the star cast on the sets soon.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Ranbir Kapoor will be leading the show by playing a character inspired by Lord Ram. He is joined by Sai Pallavi (as Sita), <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sunny-deol-on-ramayana-with-ranbir-kapoor-yash-we-are-aiming-for-perfection-1381210">Sunny Deol</a> (as Hanuman), and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-yash-starts-shooting-for-ramayana-in-mumbai-ready-for-a-month-long-journey-with-nitesh-tiwari-and-co-1385233">Yash </a>(as Raavan). A report by Movies Singapore recently suggested that actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/is-vijay-sethupathi-in-talks-to-play-vibhishana-in-ranbir-kapoor-and-yash-starrer-ramayana-heres-what-we-know-1400496">Vijay Sethupathi</a> is being considered for the role of Vibhishana. However, no official confirmation has been made by the makers yet. The cast also includes Ravie Dubey, Kajal Aggarwal, Rakul Preet Singh, Arun Govil, Kunal Kapoor, and others.</p>

However, Imran Khan, the nephew of the Dangal star, seems to be thinking that they are well out of their zones in recent years and need to take a back seat. In a chat with SHOWSHA, he spoke about how the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-says-salman-khan-got-heart-of-gold-credits-khan-trio-for-her-bollywood-journey-1400317">three Khans</a> may need to move to more age-appropriate roles rather than trying to be the leading men.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan need to step back from lead roles? Imran Khan comments</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/where-is-imran-khans-ex-wife-avantika-malik-now-know-about-the-celebrity-mixologist-1399939">Imran Khan</a> has made his awaited return to the entertainment industry with the release of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/happy-patel-lifetime-box-office-vir-das-starrer-emerges-a-disaster-with-closing-of-rs-5-25-crore-in-india-1400274">Happy Patel: Khatarnak Jasoos</a>, a project also starring his mama (maternal uncle) Aamir in a cameo, and has been produced under his banner. Speaking about how today&rsquo;s crowd is looking for stories that are more relatable and palatable based on their age, he spoke about the three Khans, possibly considering non-lead roles. &ldquo;As a leading man, actors also start to age out. There are certain years where you can work as a leading man, and then there comes an age where you are not able to play those roles,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Adding about how turning 60 and enjoying 30 years of stardom, they may &lsquo;start to transition the kind of roles&rsquo; they play as they turn older. Suggesting that more age-fitting roles need to be in place while resonating with the audience, he shared, &ldquo;There is a whole new younger generation that begins to attach itself to people closer to them in age and experience. When we watch films or shows, first and foremost, we are trying to see ourselves in those stories and characters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 43-year-old added how many people may find the current stories difficult to connect with: &ldquo;The younger generation might not want to watch the story of a 70-year-old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan have each had more than a few hits and&nbsp;misses at the box office in recent years, while also continuing to maintain a stronghold on their fans.&nbsp;</p>

Tu Yaa Main star recalls effects of 'hurtful' trolling]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/257599832_sk.webp"></img><p>Shanaya Kapoor might be a budding name in the Indian film industry, but she has always been known on the internet, thanks to her actor parents, Sanjay Kapoor and Maheep Kapoor. While she is showered with love by many, the 27-year-old is sometimes on the receiving end of negativity. Recently, she spoke about facing online body shaming and revealed how it affects her. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Shanaya Kapoor opens up about online body shaming</strong></h3>

<p>Staying in the limelight sometimes means living under the trolls&#39; microscope. Bollywood youngster <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/meet-actor-who-started-as-an-assistant-director-debut-movie-got-shelved-returned-with-vikrant-massey-and-is-set-to-star-in-a-survival-thriller-1400503">Shanaya Kapoor</a> is also someone who tries&nbsp;to keep her mind away from all the negativity. But when comments are made about her looks, it does hurt her a little.</p>

<p>While talking to Zoom, the Aankhon Ki Gustaakhiyan debutant stated that she seeks the audience&#39;s approval by engaging with their remarks frequently. She also tries&nbsp;to disregard comments on her looks or the negative remarks about her jawline. &ldquo;Yet, it&#39;s crucial to acknowledge that such comments can be hurtful at times; when I try to escape from that, it becomes a bit challenging for me personally,&rdquo; the actress expressed.</p>

<p>On days when the trolling is overwhelming, she turns to her mother, Maheep, and confides in her. Having said that, the actress admitted that there are all kinds of comments online. If there&nbsp;is feedback on her&nbsp;dancing or acting, then she treats them as constructive criticism, even if the remarks are expressed harshly. Shanaya thinks she owes it to the audience. &ldquo;It might not be phrased nicely, and it can sting a bit, but it serves as a reality check,&rdquo; the actress expressed.</p>

<p>On the work front, Shanaya will be next seen in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/tu-yaa-main-teaser-shanaya-kapoors-rich-social-butterfly-meets-adarsh-gouravs-small-town-rapper-in-bejoy-nambiars-romantic-thriller-1399773">Tu Yaa Main</a>. The Bejoy Nambiar survival thriller film also stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-adarsh-gourav-recalls-his-my-name-is-khan-audition-and-it-has-a-strong-shah-rukh-khan-connection-1274198">Adarsh Gaurav</a> playing the male lead, while being&nbsp;bankrolled by Aanand L. Rai and Himanshu Sharma. The upcoming drama is an official remake of the 2018 Thai film, The Pool.</p>

<p>In the movie, Shanaya and Adarsh play social media influencers who cross paths during a retreat. One thing leads to another, and they find themselves knocking horns with a deadly crocodile. Tu Yaa Main is set to release in cinemas on February 13, 2026.</p>

Earlier, Pinkvilla exclusively reported that he will be making his directorial debut with Krrish 4. Now, he&rsquo;s turning to production to bankroll his first project&nbsp;titled Storm, under his banner, HRX Films.</p>

<h3><strong>Hrithik Roshan talks about his production venture, Storm</strong></h3>

<p>Ace Bollywood actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-hrithik-roshan-turns-director-for-indias-biggest-superhero-franchise-krrish-4-to-be-produced-by-aditya-chopra-1379545">Hrithik Roshan</a> has stepped into production with his company, HRX Films. The actor has already announced <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-hrithik-roshan-and-prime-video-team-up-for-thrilling-new-original-series-storm-1397592">Storm</a> as his first project, which has gone on the floors. Talking about the upcoming entertainer, the Fighter actor told Economic Times that Storm has been a fulfilling journey.</p>

<p>The actor recalled that when his cousin and co-producer Eshaan Roshan pitched Ajitpal Singh as the director of their first project, he wasn&rsquo;t aware of his work. Since the script was &ldquo;incredibly beautiful and impactful,&rdquo; Hrithik decided to meet with Singh. After their meeting, the Jodhaa Akbar actor fell in love with Ajit&rsquo;s creative mind and assured the filmmaker that he would be with him, whatever he creates.</p>

<p>While Storm is Roshan&rsquo;s first project under his banner, they have many in the pipeline. Having said that, Hrithik admitted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a great exercise in judging my worth as an actor myself. I see so much talent around me now; it makes me rethink my own skills and reminds me that I need to get better to match up to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unaware, Prime Video officially announced Storm in October 2025 as an&nbsp;original drama series. The upcoming entertainer features an impressive ensemble cast, including Parvathy Thiruvothu, Alaya F, Srishti Shrivastava, Rrama Sharma, Rajit Kapur, Ashish Vidyarthi, and Hrithik&rsquo;s lady love, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/hrithik-roshan-shares-inside-pics-with-gf-saba-azad-sussanne-khan-as-he-welcomes-eshaans-wife-aishwarya-into-family-1399585">Saba Azad</a>.</p>

<p>In the same interview with ET, the Dhoom 2 star divulged about his production house, HRX Films is&nbsp;a division of Filmkraft Productions Pvt. Ltd. With his banner, the actor intends to hit the sweet spot between commercial production and content that is high on emotions and nuances. He also credited his brother Eshaan for supporting him in his journey as an actor in films they made under FilmKraft since Krrish.</p>

Debuting in 2012 with Karan Johar directorial Student of the Year, Varun entered Bollywood as a classic commercial hero, charming, energetic, and clearly positioned for mainstream success. While the film made him instantly popular, it also labelled him as a &ldquo;naive&rdquo; actor in the eyes of critics, someone still finding his footing in terms of depth and range.</p>

<p>A turning point came when <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/hai-jawani-toh-ishq-hona-hai-did-varun-dhawan-mrunal-thakur-film-a-pregnancy-scene-on-mumbai-streets-watch-video-1400479">Varun Dhawan</a> began experimenting with characters that demanded emotional vulnerability and restraint with film such as Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania rather than loud heroism. Then came Badlapur which marked his transition from a star kid with promise to an actor capable of anchoring complex narratives.</p>

<p>What stands out in Varun&rsquo;s filmography is his adaptability. He has moved comfortably from romance in Main Tera Hero, intense thriller Badlapur to slice-of-life drama such as Sui Dhaaga, and large-scale action films like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/border-2-box-office-collections-2nd-week-sunny-deol-varun-dhawan-diljit-dosanjh-ahan-shetty-starrer-crosses-rs-270-crore-mark-in-14-days-1400487">Border 2</a>, Baby John, and Dishoom. With each genre shift, his confidence as a performer has grown ten-fold, and so has his command over subtle expressions, body language, and silence, which clearly reflected in his work.</p>

<p><strong>Varun Dhawan&rsquo;s films that have defined his filmography</strong></p>

<p><strong>Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania</strong></p>

<p>Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania which came out in 2014, was directed by Shashank Khaitan, and starred Varun Dhawan and Alia Bhatt in lead roles. Varun played Rakesh &ldquo;Humpty&rdquo; Sharma, a carefree Delhi boy whose journey from flirtatious charm to emotional maturity highlighted his ease in romance and heartfelt performance in a mainstream entertainer.</p>

<p><strong>Badlapur</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Badlapur marked a major shift, revealing a darker, more intense side of the actor. The 2015 film was directed by Sriram Raghavan, featured Varun Dhawan alongside Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Huma Qureshi, and Yami Gautam. Varun portrayed Raghu, a grief-stricken man consumed by vengeance, delivering a raw, brooding performance that dismantled his romantic-hero image and showcased his dramatic range.</p>

<p><strong>October</strong></p>

<p>October further cemented his growth with a deeply understated performance. Helmed by Shoojit Sircar, October starred Varun Dhawan alongside Banita Sandhu. Varun played Dan, a quiet hotel intern whose emotional restraint and silent devotion marked a career-defining, understated performance, firmly establishing his growth as a mature and sensitive actor.</p>

<p><strong>Baby John</strong></p>

<p>Baby John saw him return to mass cinema with maturity. The intense action film marked Varun Dhawan&rsquo;s return to mass cinema. Directed by Kalees, the film stars Varun Dhawan alongside Keerthy Suresh and Wamiqa Gabbi. Varun plays a tough, emotionally layered man with a violent past, blending action-hero swagger with restrained intensity.</p>

<p><strong>Border 2</strong></p>

<p>Border 2 signals his entry into large-scale, patriotic storytelling with gravitas. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/border-2-find-out-which-courageous-war-hero-varun-dhawan-will-portray-in-sunny-deol-led-movie-report-1387073">war film</a> marks Varun Dhawan&rsquo;s entry into large-scale patriotic cinema. Directed by Anurag Singh, Border 2 features Sunny Deol, Diljit Dosanjh, Varun Dhawan, and Ahan Shetty. Varun plays the real-life Param Vir Chakra recipient Major Hoshiar Singh Dahiya, bringing emotional depth and seriousness to a high-stakes war narrative rooted in duty and sacrifice. Border 2 added Rs. 3.25 crore to the tally on its second Thursday, bringing the total collection slightly over the Rs. 278 crore net mark at the Indian box office. It is now on the way to cross Rs. 300 crore mark.</p>

<p>From the glossy corridors of Student of the Year to emotionally demanding and physically intense roles, Varun&rsquo;s evolution reflects an actor who has grown up on screen and continues to push himself with every project.</p>

After his debut movie, Tadap, it took five years for Ahan Shetty to return to the big screen. Rumors have it that the actor&rsquo;s high entourage cost was the reason producers were reluctant to move forward with him. In a recent interview, Ahan&rsquo;s father, Suniel Shetty, shared his two cents on the matter.</p>

<h3><strong>Suniel Shetty reacts to son Ahan&rsquo;s high entourage cost</strong></h3>

<p>After <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/border-2s-ahan-shetty-recalls-being-unable-to-sign-films-after-tadap-says-he-was-very-low-on-confidence-1400362">Ahan Shetty</a> made his debut with Tadap in 2021, he was rumored to be starring in Sanki, bankrolled by Sajid Nadiadwala. But later, the film was shelved. A report by Bollywood Hungama stated that the producer had second thoughts about making the movie after he saw Ahan&rsquo;s high entourage costs, that was billed to production.</p>

<p>Now, while talking to Lehren Retro, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/welcome-to-the-jungle-akshay-kumar-suniel-shetty-raveena-tandons-film-to-hit-cinemas-on-june-26-1400237">Suniel Shetty</a> dismissed the claims, stating that his son has never gone overboard with his entourage. Calling the reports mere rumors, the senior Bollywood actor expressed that this gossip was circulated at the producer&rsquo;s convenience. Challenging the claims, senior Shetty stated that if the producer says that he can show a bill, then I will admit it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, the father steps in and will step in, very, very clearly. Don&rsquo;t spread lies to hide your weaknesses, because it&rsquo;s not fair to Ahan,&rdquo; stated Suniel. The Border actor further expressed that his son is very careful with his entourage, and even if he needs them, he can bear the expenses himself. He further underscored that Ahan has just arrived, and this is his time to settle into the industry. &ldquo;So, there are no tantrums. Ho hi nahi sakta (It&rsquo;s not possible),&rdquo; expressed Ahan&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>Earlier, while talking to Mid-Day, Ahan expressed that it took him five years to return to the big screen with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-ahan-shetty-says-border-2-trailer-response-has-him-speechless-promises-to-carry-legacy-with-immense-respect-1399996">Border 2</a> because he was bound by a contract. The 30-year-old actor divulged that he was tied down to a contract with Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment. Hence, he wasn&#39;t allowed to sign any other movie for four years, even though many projects came his way.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/668853041_vijay-sethupathi-ramayana-webp.webp"></img><p>Ramayana, starring Ranbir Kapoor and Yash in the lead roles, is slated to be released as a two-part venture on Diwali 2026 and 2027. Now, it appears that Vijay Sethupathi is in talks to portray the role of Vibhishana.</p>

<p><strong>Is Vijay Sethupathi set to play Vibhishana?</strong></p>

<p>According to an online report by Movies Singapore, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/what-made-vijay-sethupathi-break-down-thrice-during-filming-a-scene-for-maharaj-throwback-1394069">Vijay Sethupathi</a> is reportedly in discussions with the makers of Ramayana. The actor is being considered for the role of Vibhishana, Ravana&rsquo;s brother, who chooses the path of truth and justice and supports Rama in winning the war.</p>

<p>The character is said to be an important and integral part of the film, making it a significant role for the actor. However, as of now, no official confirmation has been made by the makers.</p>

<p>Ramayana is an upcoming magnum opus that retells the Hindu mythological epic. The multistarrer features <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/animal-park-ranbir-kapoor-starrer-to-begin-shoot-from-mid-2027-sandeep-reddy-vanga-calls-it-a-war-between-two-look-alikes-1400462">Ranbir Kapoor</a>&nbsp;as Lord Rama, with Toxic star Yash portraying Ravana.</p>

<p>Sai Pallavi essays the role of Goddess Sita, while the cast also includes Sunny Deol, Ravie Dubey, Kajal Aggarwal, Rakul Preet Singh, Arun Govil, Kunal Kapoor, and several others in key roles.</p>

<p>The much-awaited cinematic venture is directed by Nitesh Tiwari, with songs and background score composed by AR Rahman and Hans Zimmer.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Sethupathi&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Vijay Sethupathi was last seen in a lead role in Gandhi Talks. Directed by Kishor Pandurang Belekar, the silent film featured Aravind Swamy as the co-lead, along with Aditi Rao Hydari, Siddharth Jadhav, Mahesh Manjrekar, Usha Nadkarni, and others in key roles.</p>

<p>The film, which was released on January 30, 2026, focused on the collision of three lives in Mumbai: an unemployed man desperate for a job, a fallen wealthy businessman, and a thief, and how their lives change after crossing paths.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the actor has wrapped up shooting for his next lead film, titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/puri-sethupathi-is-titled-slumdog-vijay-sethupathis-birthday-special-first-look-is-raw-and-ruthless-1399954">Slum Dog: 33 Temple Road</a>. Directed by Puri Jagannadh, the movie features Tabu and Samyuktha in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>Additionally, Vijay Sethupathi will also make a cameo appearance in the Rajinikanth-starrer Jailer 2. Directed by Nelson Dilipkumar, the sequel is expected to arrive in theatres by mid-2026.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Jawan actor is also part of the Silambarasan TR starrer Arasan, directed by Vetrimaaran.</p>

Just two weeks before the shoot was scheduled to begin, the filmmaker found herself without a heroine, triggering a frantic last-minute casting scramble.<br />
<br />
<strong>When Ayesha Takia walked out of&nbsp;Main Hoon Na</strong><br />
<br />
Revisiting the incident in a recent vlog, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/shah-rukh-khan-and-farah-khan-set-for-a-film-reunion-director-says-if-i-do-it-will-be-with-shah-rukh-1400056">Farah Khan</a> recalled that the time, everything was in place. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-king-main-hoon-na-2-front-runner-to-be-shah-rukh-khans-next-farah-khan-cracks-double-role-idea-for-srk-1400476">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Zayed Khan and Sushmita Sen were locked in, Darjeeling locations had been booked, costumes were ready, and preparations were complete. Newcomer Ayesha Takia had been finalised for the role of Sanjana. At the last minute weeks before filming, Ayesha backed out unexpectedly, leaving Farah panicked as it was her first film. Ayesha had taken up another project, Socha Na Tha. What was initially communicated as a four-day commitment stretched into months. With rehearsals incomplete and no time to wait, Farah was left scrambling.<br />
<br />
<strong>Amrita Rao was cast last minute</strong><br />
<br />
The turning point came thanks to Gauri Khan, who stepped in with a suggestion that would ultimately change the film&rsquo;s fate. Gauri recommended a young actress she had seen in a coffee commercial, who turned out to be Amrita Rao. Farah was hesitant at first. Amrita&rsquo;s simple appearance did not align with her vision for Sanjana. Still, she agreed to meet her.</p>

<p>What followed was an instant transformation. Farah asked Amrita to perform an emotional confrontation scene opposite Shah Rukh Khan. Watching her through the camera lens, Farah was stunned. The decision was made on the spot. Years later, Farah fondly recalled that Amrita was already juggling several films at the time and still made it work. Against all odds, Main Hoon Na not only went on floors but it became a massive success, with Amrita Rao&rsquo;s Sanjana remaining etched in Bollywood&rsquo;s memory.</p>

Ya Jaane Na in 2008. A few more hits and misses later, the star stepped back from the acting world and took a break for over a decade before returning with Happy Patel: Khatarnak Jasoos in 2026. Between his debut and break, the actor dated and got married to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/where-is-imran-khans-ex-wife-avantika-malik-now-know-about-the-celebrity-mixologist-1399939">Avantika Malik</a>, and they separated after eight years of marriage. Now, the star is finally opening up on how growing up made him realize the importance of being in a &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Imran Khan reveals how dating as youngsters put his and Avantika Malik&rsquo;s relationship under strain</strong></p>

<p>In an interview with Etimes, Imran Khan has spoken about his widely talked about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-reason-behind-imran-khan-and-avantika-maliks-separation-476279">marriage and divorce</a> to Avantika Malik. The actor revealed he first decided to dig through his thoughts back in 2016, which led him to undergo an analysis in the following years. Being unemployed and parenting their daughter Imara, he began focusing on his own health, during which he realized that his dynamic with his partner was &lsquo;unhealthy&rsquo;. Imran recalled, &quot;It was a relationship that started at a very young age and when you are 18-19 years old you don&#39;t have nearly enough life experience to have an understanding of what are healthy interpersonal dynamics and what are unhealthy dynamics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After growing up, he was able to analyse that they were not in a healthy patterned relationship, instead the two were in &lsquo;a cycle that we are unable to fix or change.&rsquo; He wished to remove himself from the marriage to be healthy and clarified that, despite what was believed, his mental health crisis was not triggered by his separation, and he does not blame anyone for the split. &ldquo;It is my making the choice to end my marriage that was the turning point in my personal mental health journey, that allowed me to actually heal and get better. It is because we were not in sync. We were not able to support each other being the best version of self,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>The I Hate Luv Storys star has doubled down on the idea that separation is a better path than being in despair. He said, &quot;While a partner&#39;s separation is unpleasant and hurtful to all, from the two individuals involved, the family, the child, it is still preferable over remaining in an unhealthy dynamic because to perpetuate an unhealthy pattern is madness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actor has since moved on and is known to have been dating actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/who-is-lekha-washington-imran-khans-girlfriend-who-helped-him-heal-from-depression-and-find-his-way-back-to-movies-1399942">Lekha Washington</a> for a while, with the two publicly confirming it in 2024.&nbsp;</p>

The film focuses on the story of Jaskirat Singh Rangi, a spy recruited by IB chief Ajay Sanyal for Project Dhurandhar.</p>

<p>The undercover mission sees Jaskirat infiltrating Pakistan&rsquo;s Karachi underworld to dismantle terror networks. He becomes a gangster himself to gain trust and gather intelligence, culminating in a major revenge operation against an ISI mastermind. How he manages to complete the mission, along with the exploration of his origins, is expected to be revealed in the sequel.</p>

<p><strong>Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s upcoming film</strong></p>

<p>Following the success of Dhurandhar, Ranveer Singh was expected to appear next in Don 3. However, Pinkvilla reported that the actor has stepped away from the project.

<p>Additionally, it has been learned that Singh has fast-tracked his zombie project, tentatively titled Pralay, with director Jai Mehta.</p>

Here's what we know ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/48632823_img_20260202_174156_592.webp"></img><p style="text-align:justify">Golmaal is among the most successful Hindi comedy franchises. Ajay Devgn and director Rohit Shetty had announced the fifth installment of the much-loved franchise back then during the lockdown. Though the movie took a backfoot due to Shetty&#39;s other commitments- Indian Police Force, Singham Again and IPS Maria. Finally, the movie is now getting on the floors very soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As per Variety India, Rohit Shetty pulled off a big casting coup for his upcoming directorial, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-rakesh-maria-biopic-with-john-abraham-rohit-shetty-to-reunite-with-ajay-devgn-for-golmaal-five-in-2026-1391562">Golmaal 5</a>. Reportedly, Akshay Kumar has joined the comedy franchise, who will be seen playing the main antagonist opposite Ajay Devgn and his gang in the film. It will mark the sixth film of Akshay Kumar and Ajay Devgn together, after Suhaag, Khakee, Insan, Sooryavanshi, and Singham Again.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It will be back-to-back negative characters for Akshay Kumar, as he is also playing a villain opposite Saif Ali Khan in Priyadarshan-directed <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-priyadarshan-confirms-mohanlals-cameo-in-haiwaan-with-akshay-kumar-and-saif-ali-khan-1397061">Haiwaan</a>. However, the tone and the antagonistic arcs in both the films is said to be poles apart.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Besides the two superstars, the movie will feature an ensemble star cast that includes, Arshad Warsi, Tusshar Kapoor, Shreyas Talpade, and Kunal Kemmu, along with Johnny Lever, Sanjay Mishra, Mukesh Tiwari and Ashwini Kalsekar. Sharman Joshi and Kareena Kapoor Khan are also likely to return to the franchise; however, there is no confirmation on the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The shoot is expected to begin by the end of February 2026 in Film City, Mumbai, for a grand theatrical release next year. Before moving onto Golmaal 5, Rohit Shetty is expected to wrap IPS Maria, led by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-john-abraham-reboots-force-teams-up-with-bhav-dhulia-for-force-3-1396355">John Abraham</a>. The filmmaker will return to the comic space after a gap of around 9 years. If Golmaal 5 turns out to be a well made film, it will set the box office on fire as the franchise holds immense popularity among the audience.&nbsp;</p>

For the day out, Sonam got dressed up in a crisp white shirt. She left half of her shirt unbuttoned to flaunt her bump. The Veere Di Wedding actress paired it with a floor-length pleated skirt and matching footwear. She kept her makeup minimal to let her mommy glow do the talking. With her hair tied in a high, stylish bun, dark eyewear, silver hoops, and a cute white bucket bag, she finished off her look for the day.</p>

<p>After marrying Anand, Sonam became a mother for the first time in August 2022 and gave birth to their son, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/sonam-kapoor-says-her-child-her-priority-acting-will-take-backseat-wont-stop-working-completely-1180121">Vayu Kapoor Ahuja</a>.

However, she&rsquo;s a desi girl at heart whose favorite job right now is watching her daughter grow. Recently, the actress admitted that she&rsquo;s obsessed with her daughter and can often be found saying &ldquo;I Love You&rdquo; to her baby girl.</p>

<h3><strong>Deepika Padukone admits to being obsessed with Dua</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/not-alia-bhatt-but-sai-pallavi-to-replace-deepika-padukone-as-sumathi-in-prabhas-kalki-2898-ad-part-2-find-out-1400287">Deepika Padukone</a> has finally returned to the limelight after giving birth to her daughter, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/first-pics-deepika-padukone-and-ranveer-singh-reveal-daughter-duas-face-on-diwali-and-internet-cant-keep-calm-1397873">Dua Padukone Singh</a>, in September 2024. In a recent chit-chat with Harper&#39;s Bazaar India, the actress spoke about her obsession with the baby girl. When the Om Shanti Om debutant was asked about her recent obsession, she admitted, &ldquo;Not current, I&rsquo;m going to remove &lsquo;current&rsquo; from it. My obsession is my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Further on, DP was asked to reveal the weirdest thing she had in her bag. This is when the diva went back and recalled that there was a piece of thepla that Dua was eating, and it was in her bag, which she found after two days. While music keeps the actress sane, ever since she became a mom, Deepika&rsquo;s playlist has changed. Unlike earlier, she now vibes to nursery rhymes, and the Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes song has taken over her favorite karaoke track.</p>

<p>Prior to being an actress, Deepika used to play badminton. Hence, one would think that if not an actor, she would have become an award-winning badminton player. But, according to the global icon, she would have become an interior designer. Having said that, she did divulge that her husband, actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ranveer-singh-to-join-game-changer-director-shankar-in-dream-project-velpari-all-we-know-so-far-1400349">Ranveer Singh</a>, thinks that being a lawyer should have been an alternative career option. When asked which phrase she often finds herself using, the happy mom was quick to state that she says I love you a lot to her baby.</p>

<p>Well, Deepika is all set to return to the big screen. She will be next seen in Siddharth Anand&rsquo;s upcoming actioner, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/king-release-date-teaser-shah-rukh-khan-is-ready-to-roar-with-siddharth-anands-actioner-on-december-24-1400186">King</a>, co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Suhana Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, and others.

But since the film, depicting major clashes between India and Pakistan, came at a time of the Indian elections, many labelled it as propaganda. Later, while promoting Article 370 in 2024, Dhar reacted to it. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>When Aditya Dhar reacted to Uri being called a propaganda movie</strong></h3>

<p>During a promotional event, a media professional underscored that since <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/movies-like-uri-1339202">Uri: The Surgical Strike</a> (2019) and Article 370 (2024) are coming around Indian elections, some assumed that they&rsquo;re propaganda films. Sharing his two cents on the matter, filmmaker Aditya Dhar stated that he doesn&rsquo;t care about people who label the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/dhurandhar-2-vicky-kaushal-to-join-ranveer-singh-in-aditya-dhars-upcoming-actioner-heres-what-we-know-1400083">Vicky Kaushal</a>-led movie a propaganda film.</p>

<p>He further stated that all he cares about is when the film is coming. Calling the Indian audience &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, Dhar continued that after watching the movies, the viewers know which one is propaganda and which one is well-intended. Dhar was quick to state that till the time he&rsquo;s in the industry, the intention of his films will always be right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day the intention is wrong, I will stop making films. I don&#39;t care what people say, especially those people who were agenda-driven critics,&rdquo; added the Dhoom Dhaam producer. Aditya also took the opportunity to highlight his observation. According to him, the downfall of &ldquo;agenda-driven critics&rdquo; happened from his debut film, Uri: The Surgical Strike. All the people who said bad things about the 2019 movie were wronged when the audience thronged to the theatre and made the National Award-winning film a blockbuster.</p>

<p>Dhar concluded his argument by opining that the audience doesn&rsquo;t care what a filmmaker&rsquo;s political agenda is and how they&rsquo;re presenting their reviews. All they care about is the intention of the director.</p>

<p>Last year, Aditya Dhar dropped another bomb, his second directorial venture titled Dhurandhar, which made history. This year, he is all set to serve the audience a massive entertainer, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/aditya-dhar-drops-major-hint-about-teaser-of-ranveer-singhs-dhurandhar-2-teaser-will-be-out-1400148">Dhurandhar Part 2</a>, for which the audience is super excited. The sequel, tentatively titled Dhurandhar: The Revenge, is set to hit cinemas on March 19, 2026.</p>

Here's what happened]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/1350116476_kat.webp"></img><p>Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif share a very close and special bond with each other. When the actress stepped foot in Bollywood, Khan proved to be her guiding light. Decades after meeting each other, the celebs continue to stay affectionate with each other. But did you know that once Salman impressed an angry Katrina by dancing with a rose in his mouth? Read on to know what actually happened.</p>

<h3><strong>How Salman Khan impressed angry Katrina Kaif</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/378048/exclusive-salman-khan-dines-katrina-kaif-and-family">Salman Khan</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-katrina-kaif-on-her-equation-with-salman-khan-i-think-we-have-just-both-grown-along-the-way-1259432">Katrina Kaif</a> first worked together in the 2005 film, Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? Since then, the celebs share a special bond. Rumors had it that the stars dated each other, too. Restaurateur AD Singh recently recalled how Salman once charmed an angry Katrina with his peculiar antics.</p>

<p>While talking to Outlook Traveller, Singh shared that Salman and Katrina&rsquo;s romance played out in the early days of his restaurant. One night, when Singh was at his restaurant, he spotted Kaif with her group, lounging outside. Then there was Khan at the bar with his brothers, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sohail-khan-opens-up-on-his-relationship-with-ex-wife-seema-sajdeh-and-why-they-got-divorced-when-husband-and-wife-start-fighting-1395893">Sohail Khan</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-malaika-arora-on-her-broken-marriage-with-arbaaz-khan-it-came-to-a-point-where-we-decided-1395664">Arbaaz Khan</a>. After sensing the vibes between Katrina and Salman, Singh speculated that there&rsquo;s a cold war going on between them.</p>

<p>Later that night, the Dabangg star put a rose in his mouth and smilingly danced by her table while going to the bathroom and coming back. Calling Khan&rsquo;s action &ldquo;adorable&rdquo;, the restaurant owner further shared that Salman was able to charm the Merry Christmas actress with his sweet gesture, leading to them resolving their issue. &ldquo;They got back together. It was a very charming, memorable moment with Salman and Katrina,&rdquo; stated AD Singh.</p>

<p>This incident takes us back to the time when Katrina spoke about her relationship with Salman. In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, the Welcome actress stated that over the past decades, both of them have grown up. &ldquo;That&#39;s been a wonderful journey for us right from Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? to Tiger 3,&rdquo; the actress underscored, adding that their on-set equation has also changed.</p>

<p>Since Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?, Salman and Katrina have worked in multiple films, including Partner, Hello, Yuvvraaj, Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai, Bharat, and Tiger 3.</p>

The iconic character played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/producer-says-salman-khan-ensured-vivek-oberoi-doesnt-work-in-bollywood-post-aishwarya-rai-breakup-and-2003-press-con-1400332">Salman Khan</a> in the 2003 film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/tere-naam-dialogues-1314313">Tere Naam</a> is making its way back to the audience with a theatrical re-release, as reported on January 31. Gearing up to hit the fans in the feels, the film will be made available to watch in cinema houses from February 27, 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Tere Naam re-release details</strong></p>

<p>Joining the lineup of Bollywood films coming across newfound fame with re-releases, the 2003 release, Tere Naam, will be selling tickets once again for new shows starting February 27, 2026. As reported by News18, the Satish Kaushik directorial, which grabbed attention 23 years ago for the dramatic portrayal of a lover by Salman Khan, has eventually developed a cult following since then, and is expected to make a strong comeback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the most iconic songs were voiced by Himesh Reshammiya in the film and have found a massive fan base in the years to come. Sajid-Wajid worked on some of the composition of the tracks with a background score by Bikram Vicckey Goswami. It targeted the Independence Day audience with its release more than two decades ago and made over twice its production costs at the box office, being called an average hit. More than its immediate effect, the movie has been praised for a long time, thanks to the angst presented on screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Tere Naam</strong></p>

<p>The story follows Radhe Mohan, played by Salman Khan, and Nirjara Bharadwaj, portrayed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-bhumika-chawla-reveals-reason-her-absence-bollywood-says-she-s-open-good-hindi-projects-899435">Bhumika Chawla</a>, whose sad and dramatic love story surprises viewers with multiple twists. As he chases after her despite her family&rsquo;s intervention and tries his hardest to win her over, his anger and society&rsquo;s expectations keep them away from each other. The film&rsquo;s tragic end has had a stronghold on fans for years now, with another chance to experience it on the big screen this time, following its August 15, 2003, initial drop.</p>

The Anurag Singh war film marks Shetty&rsquo;s second feature in five years. While talking to Mid-Day, Ahan revealed that even though a lot of offers came his way after his film debut, he had to ignore them all as he was tied by a contract with the producer of his first film, Tadap. Read on!</p>

<h2 id="697dc61a08d48"><strong>Ahan Shetty recalls being unable to sign films after Tadap</strong></h2>

<p>The 2021 romantic action movie Tadap marked <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-ahan-shetty-says-border-2-trailer-response-has-him-speechless-promises-to-carry-legacy-with-immense-respect-1399996">Ahan Shetty</a>&rsquo;s big screen debut. After five years, the 30-year-old actor returned with Border 2. Talking about the five-year hiatus, the actor said it was because of a binding contract he signed with producer Sajid Nadiawala. Ahan told the publication that he was tied down to a contract with Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, I wasn&#39;t allowed to sign any other movie for four years. A lot of offers came my way, but you can&#39;t [breach] a contract,&rdquo; added the actor. Talking about his debut movie, Ahan stated that even though some stated that Tadap did bad business at the box office, they actually made profits. &ldquo;Tadap made Rs 40 crore at a time when films weren&#39;t crossing Rs 10 crore,&rdquo; he stated. Having said that, he also admitted that the film came with expectations. &ldquo;After that, it was difficult. I was very low on confidence during that period,&rdquo; revealed <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/welcome-to-the-jungle-akshay-kumar-suniel-shetty-raveena-tandons-film-to-hit-cinemas-on-june-26-1400237">Suniel Shetty</a>&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>Recently, Ahan was seen as Lt Cdr Mahendra Singh Rawat in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/border-2-movie-review-sunny-deol-varun-dhawan-diljit-dosanjh-ahan-shettys-war-saga-grips-with-emotion-and-nostalgia-1400153">Border 2</a>. Sharing how he ended up landing the role of an officer of the Indian Navy, junior Shetty recalled that producer JP Dutta and his daughter Nidhi Dutta were home for dinner when she asked if he would want to be part of the epic saga.</p>

<p>For a couple of days, Shetty didn&rsquo;t really believe that the makers wanted him, a newcomer, to be part of such a huge film. He reasoned that he had not been able to do anything for four years after Tadap and was fighting certain battles in his head. Hence, being a part of the movie with Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan, and Diljit Dosanjh meant a lot to him.</p>

New details from the two actors&rsquo; alleged feud over the actress&rsquo;s affection have surfaced. Producer Shailendra Singh has shared that the Sultan actor was furious when he witnessed the press conference held by the Prince actor, accusing the former of warning him over his relationship with the Miss World 1994.</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan&rsquo;s alleged reaction to Vivek Oberoi&rsquo;s press conference revealed</strong></p>

<p>As fans remain curious about what went down between the two Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam co-stars, producer Shailendra Singh has shed some light on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-says-salman-khan-got-heart-of-gold-credits-khan-trio-for-her-bollywood-journey-1400317">Salman Khan</a>&rsquo;s reaction to the meeting with the media. During a chat with Siddharth Kannan, he revealed that Khan was at his residence when he watched the press conference and reacted with fury. &ldquo;He (Salman) was very angry. He was like, &lsquo;What the h-ll?&rsquo; Earlier, he would openly show his emotions. Now, he has much more control. My only reaction to Vivek&rsquo;s press conference was to tell Salman that in life, we should act, not react. Whatever needs to be done can be done later,&rdquo; he shared.</p>

<p>As for his advice to the Tere Naam star? The producer wanted to wait for time to take its course before doing anything. &ldquo;I asked him not to act on impulse, to wait and fight the battle silently. I think he did that. He made sure Vivek doesn&rsquo;t work in Bollywood anymore. I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but that&rsquo;s how it looks,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the Kyun!

Starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/what-is-parineeti-chopras-net-worth-from-rs-22-crore-lavish-bungalow-in-mumbai-to-3-high-end-cars-everything-about-mom-to-bes-luxurious-lifestyle-1396090">Parineeti Chopra</a> in the titular role of the sportswoman whose rise to the top of the game was chronicled in the story, it was a major project for her. Following a theatrical release on March 26, 2021, the film found its way to the smaller screens via an OTT release on Prime Video. Now, the 35-year-old has shared her thoughts on the Indian actress unfollowing her on social media, sharing how their meetings were only related to work, and they never had the chance to develop it into something more.</p>

<p><strong>Saina Nehwal opens up on Parineeti Chopra unfollowing her on Instagram</strong></p>

<p>During the making of the movie, Saina, Parineeti Chopra was spotted hanging out with the subject of the film, player <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/who-is-saina-nehwals-husband-timeline-of-badminton-players-love-story-with-parupalli-kashyap-and-split-after-7-years-1393663">Saina Nehwal</a>; however, she has since unfollowed the badminton star. The surprising action on social media was noticed by fans, and during the sportswoman&rsquo;s appearance on Subhojit Ghosh&rsquo;s YouTube interview, she lightly touched on the topic, claiming that she never became friends with the actress and they stuck to only work, where she narrated her life to the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Keeping her reaction mostly neutral, she shared, &ldquo;Actually, I did not notice this and na kabhi dhyan gaya hain ispe. Kyuki life has been so busy with my training and tournaments and events ki is&nbsp;cheez pe dhyan nahi gaya. Jitni&nbsp;bhi baatein hui hain humari, it&rsquo;s not like ki friends ban gaye the kuch&hellip; in a few sessions I was also like a professional, telling her ki maine life mein kya-kya kiya, maine kuch bola hi nahi ki maine friendship kari thi ya kuch (I never paid any attention to this fact. Whatever we talked about, it wasn&rsquo;t as if we became friends. I told her what my life has looked like so far. I never said we developed a friendship).&quot;</p>

<p>Saina Nehwal was firm to note that their meetings were only for &lsquo;professional work,&rsquo; a fact both parties were well aware of. They kept their sessions to a couple of hours, once every few weeks, in the presence of the film&rsquo;s director, Amole Gupte, and that was about it. They never went far enough in their relationship to have dinners or lunches together, as per the player.</p>

<p>She concluded saying, &ldquo;Aisa kuch bhi nahi tha ki humne bohot time spend kiya taki hum friends ban sake, it was mostly about the work (film) which she was about to do&hellip; But humne kuch zyada friendship nahi banayi thi, to follow or unfollow.&rdquo; (It was never that we spent a lot of time together so that we could become pals. We did not become close friends to check about following or unfollowing each other.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Saina Nehwal announced her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/saina-nehwal-steps-down-from-competitive-badminton-citing-knee-injury-internet-reacts-1400059">retirement from competitive badminton</a> on January 19, 2026.</p>

<h3><strong>Mona Singh calls out women&rsquo;s expiry date in Bollywood</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/meet-the-actor-who-won-dance-show-landed-an-iconic-tv-role-froze-her-eggs-to-focus-on-acting-played-kareena-kapoors-sister-in-her-debut-film-1400268">Mona Singh</a>&rsquo;s impressive filmography boasts of some popular characters like Mona Sahastrabuddhe from 3 Idiots, Gurpreet Kaur Chaddha from Laal Singh Chaddha, and Simi Kaler from Border 2. But in some of them, the actress in her 40s played characters who are older than her.</p>

<p>While talking to PTI, Singh opined that she hasn&rsquo;t cared about her on-screen age because she is very confident and knows who she is. For her, there&rsquo;s nothing to prove, which is why she keeps taking risks. Having said that, the Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin star is often asked, &lsquo;Why are you so old on screen?&rsquo; To this, she responds that it doesn&#39;t matter. &ldquo;It&#39;s the character that I&#39;m playing, and it really excites me,&rdquo; Mona expressed.</p>

<p>Having said that, she highlighted that it&rsquo;s sad that Bollywood is the only industry where women come with an expiry date. &ldquo;Whereas men in their 60s can still play the romantic leads, women can&#39;t,&rdquo; expressed the actress, adding that she has never really cared about that because she didn&rsquo;t want to be that.</p>

<p>Talking about her work front, Mona started the year by playing a don in Vir Das&rsquo;s directorial debut film, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/happy-patel-khatarnak-jasoos-movie-review-aamir-khan-and-vir-das-film-is-all-about-read-between-the-lines-1399948">Happy Patel: Khatarnak Jasoos</a>. Backed by Aamir Khan&rsquo;s production house, the movie also stars Das along with Mithila Palkar, Sharib Hashmi, and others. Actor Imran Khan also made his comeback to the big screen with the comedy-drama.</p>

<p>Recently, the audience saw Mona playing wife to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sunny-deol-embraces-and-poses-with-half-sisters-esha-and-ahana-at-border-2-screening-watch-1400201">Sunny Deol</a>&rsquo;s character, Lt Col Fateh Singh Kaler, in the epic war film, Border 2.

<p>He said, as quoted by Hindustan Times, &ldquo;I think me and Shah Rukh sir will work on definitely something. But Jawan 2, I personally feel, maybe some years later. Not the immediate next. But definitely me and Shah Rukh sir will look into something when it comes in its flow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Recently, another rumor was rife about the Bigil hitmaker being Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s one conditional addition for the progress of Don 3. Many wondered if the Don franchise would be their next collaboration, but the filmmaker was quick to shut down the claims, &ldquo;Oh oh! That&rsquo;s a rumour. I also read it. No no, nothing like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, following Jawan, he is once again working with Deepika Padukone for Allu Arjun&rsquo;s next. The highly-awaited project, tentatively titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/deepika-padukone-is-my-lucky-charm-fans-will-see-her-completely-different-side-atlee-on-working-with-actor-in-aa22xa6-1400259">AA22xA6</a>, has him calling the actress his &lsquo;lucky charm&rsquo; and &lsquo;wonderful&rsquo; to work with.</p>

The National Award-winning actor was quick to put all speculations to rest and stated that the film will definitely be made.

<p>Having said that, he stated that Hera Pheri 3, with his iconic character Babu Rao, would be the same. &ldquo;But even at the cost of modesty, I am saying that if they&rsquo;re going with the idea of doing Hera Pheri without Babu Rao, then it will be a disaster,&rdquo; quipped the senior actor.</p>

<p>Giving his final comments, Rawal expressed, &ldquo;So, it&#39;s simple, if this gets resolved between the two, I will sign the papers. Nothing to do with me, but it will happen 100%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-priyadarshan-breaks-silence-on-hera-pheri-3-with-akshay-kumar-paresh-rawal-and-suniel-shetty-it-has-to-do-justice-1397060">Priyadarshan</a> said that he can&rsquo;t tamper with the legacy of the franchise. Hence, unless he cracks the full film, he will never attempt part three. &ldquo;I cannot tell if I am doing the third part, unless and until I can crack a film which has to do justice to the first instalment. The first part was born, but the third one shouldn&rsquo;t let it die,&rdquo; stated the filmmaker.</p>

<p>In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, the director revealed that the film is a black dark situational comedy. He further added, “It’s not a comedy. The producer always says we should not make comedy films. Firoz Nadiadwala believes in dark humor and situational humor. And of course, it's serious cinema not a comedy or slapstick.”</p>

There’s a lot of action as well, and the scale is huge,” Ahmed added.</p>

<p>The filmmaker also shared the reason behind the movie facing multiple delays. According to him, the delay happened because the team couldn’t shoot in Kashmir in June 2025. Apparently, finding a new location that looks similar to Kashmir was tough, and coordinating the schedules of 36 actors was a huge challenge.</p>

On one side, he enjoys the love from the sea of fans waiting outside his bungalow, Mannat. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s always a risk of someone breaching his privacy. This is exactly what happened, back in 2023, when two young SRK fans sneaked in and stayed in the superstar&rsquo;s bungalow for 8 hours. Read on for more details.</p>

<h3><strong>When Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s fans sneaked into his Mumbai home</strong></h3>

<p>Back in March 2023, two young <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/shah-rukh-khan-makes-stylish-entry-in-mumbai-with-wife-gauri-and-suhana-khan-after-celebrating-new-year-video-1399607">Shah Rukh Khan</a> fans hailing from&nbsp;Bharuch,&nbsp;Gujarat were adamant on meeting the actor. But looking at the tight security at his Mumbai home, Mannat, they decided to scale the high exterior walls of the luxurious property and trespass into the actor&rsquo;s bungalow.</p>

<p>According to PTI, the Bandra Police Officials informed that the youngsters between the ages of 19 and 21 were nabbed by the security personnel guarding SRK&rsquo;s home. When inquired, they spilled that they had come to meet the actor. They were booked under the necessary sections of the IPC (Indian Penal Code).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The two men, who claimed to be fans of Shah Rukh Khan, somehow managed to get inside the premises around 3-4 am. A case was registered on Thursday evening, following which the two young men in their early twenties were detained,&rdquo; said a senior police officer.</p>

<p>Reports also suggest that the intruder managed to stay inside the property for nearly eight hours before held in the actor&rsquo;s makeup room. Soon after, the guards alerted the family members, and the cops were informed.</p>

<p>Well, this isn&rsquo;t the first time that someone entered Khan&rsquo;s property without permission. During his appearance on Aap Ki Adalat in 2016, the Pathaan actor recalled how one admirer invaded his privacy just to swim in his pool. Shah Rukh divulged that during an event, some journalists came to interview him at his house.</p>

<p>This is when a man entered Mannat, took off his clothes, jumped into his swimming pool, and swam one full length. &ldquo;I was completely shocked when this happened,&rdquo; stated SRK. When the man was caught, he told the security that all he wanted to do was bathe in Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s swimming pool. &ldquo;Now I have taken a&nbsp;bath in the water with which Shah Rukh bathes, now I&rsquo;ll leave,&rdquo; the intruder told SRK&rsquo;s security.</p>

<p>On the work front, Khan will be seen in Siddharth Anand&rsquo;s upcoming actioner, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/king-release-date-teaser-shah-rukh-khan-is-ready-to-roar-with-siddharth-anands-actioner-on-december-24-1400186">King</a>, co-starring Suhana Khan, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/king-siddharth-anand-drops-big-update-on-shah-rukh-khans-film-with-suhana-deepika-padukone-good-things-1398094">Deepika Padukone</a>, Abhishek Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Rani Mukerji, and others.

<p><strong>About the Dhamaal franchise</strong></p>

<p>The first film was released in 2007 and was received well at the box office, with fans enjoying the hilarious nature of the lead stars. The original was then rebooted for a sequel in 2011, called Double Dhamaal. An unrelated third film was released in 2019 with not many returning stars and the addition of Ajay Devgn to the bunch.

He further revealed that the movie doesn&#39;t start from where Part 1 ended. Having said that, he divulged, &ldquo;It&#39;s more of a thematic sequel, and we haven&#39;t basically touched the grain of the film. The grain is the same, the strata are the same. They&#39;re different characters, but their ideology is the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to director Jaspal Singh Sandhu, the thriller is narrative-driven by well-defined characters. This time, they have taken storytelling a notch higher to give the audience a layered thriller mystery. Through the trailer, they have offered a glimpse into the morally complex world of Vadh 2, with an undefined truth.</p>

<p>Adding to this, producer Ankur Garg stated that the positive response to Vadh 2 at IFFI assured them that the audiences continue to seek out meaningful, character-driven stories. &ldquo;Vadh 2 builds on what resonated earlier while offering something fresh and impactful,&rdquo; he added.</p>

The soulful track marks Salman Khan&rsquo;s first musical collaboration with composer Himesh Reshammiya. The track has been sung by Arijit Singh and Shreya Ghoshal, while the lyrics have been penned by Sameer Anjaan.</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan in the song Maatrubhumi</strong><br />
<br />
The visuals offer glimpses into the emotional core of the film, showcasing Salman Khan who plays a soldier, and his moments with on-screen wife Chitrangada Singh, and, notably, his first-ever portrayal of a father. Designed to evoke pride and sacrifice, Maatrubhumi sets a powerful tone for the war drama.</p>

<p><strong>About the song Maatrubhumi</strong><br />
<br />
In Maatrubhumi, the first song from Salman Khan&rsquo;s much-anticipated Battle of Galwan, Chitrangada Singh delivers a portrayal that is both visually arresting and the one that emotionally connects. With quiet confidence and understated elegance, she embodies the grace and inner strength of an Indian woman whose resilience speaks louder than words. Draped in timeless sarees and styled with simplicity, Chitrangada&rsquo;s presence feels deeply rooted in culture, tradition, and authenticity, lending the narrative a grounded emotional texture.</p>

<p>True to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/superhuman-salman-khan-gets-adorable-birthday-wish-from-katrina-kaif-ajay-devgn-raises-a-toast-1399450">Salman Khan</a>&rsquo;s storytelling sensibility, Maatrubhumi treats its female character with dignity and narrative weight. Chitrangada Singh is not positioned as a decorative presence but as an integral force that drives the emotional core of the story. Her performance complements the film&rsquo;s patriotic undertones by highlighting the quieter, often overlooked sacrifices made at home.</p>

<p>The song, and Chitrangada&rsquo;s portrayal within it, reinforces the idea that patriotism is not only found in acts of valor on the border but also in the steadfast strength of those who wait, hope, and endure.</p>

In an interview with Deadline Hollywood, when asked if Animal Park is in production, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sanjay-leela-bhansali-sets-up-love-and-war-as-ranbir-kapoor-vs-vicky-kaushal-1378239">Ranbir Kapoor</a> said, &ldquo;The director is right now making another film. We should start that film in 2027. It&#39;s a bit away.&rdquo; Upon asking if he has seen the script and how much more will his character go through, Ranbir said, &ldquo;He (Reddy Vanga) just kind of flirted with what he really wants to do with the movie. He wants to make it in three parts. The second part is called Animal Park.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sanjay-leela-bhansali-takes-ranbir-kapoor-alia-bhatt-vicky-kaushal-to-sicily-for-love-wars-climax-1396399">Love and War</a> actor said, &ldquo;We have been sharing ideas from the first film itself. How he wants to take the story forward. It&#39;s very exciting because now I get to play two characters, the antagonist and the protagonist. So extremely exciting project and an extremely original director and I&#39;m very excited to be a part of it.&rdquo; Ranbir was asked if he could explain why he playing two characters in the film to those who haven&#39;t seen Animal. He explained that the antagonist gets plastic surgery, becomes like a body double, and starts looking like the protagonist.</p>

He also explained the reasons behind his decision to go ahead with an ‘A’ certificate despite the commercial implications. Speaking at a press interaction on January 26, the director addressed the issue, offering insight into his discussions with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC).</p>

<p><strong>Lokesh Kanagaraj on opting for ‘A’ Certificate for Coolie</strong><br />
<br />
According to Lokesh, the Censor Board initially suggested as many as 35 cuts for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/coolie-movie-review-rajinikanth-starrer-is-a-stylish-action-entertainer-but-fails-to-live-up-to-the-hype-1395576">Coolie</a>, prompting the team to apply for a re-censoring. However, the second review saw the same recommendation, with no reduction in the number of proposed edits. The director chose to retain the original version and accept an adults-only classification instead. Kanagaraj said, “I opted for an A certificate because the CBFC suggested 35 cuts for Coolie. We applied for re-censoring, but they once again recommended the same 35 cuts.”</p>

<p><strong>On suffering heavy revenue loss</strong><br />
<br />
Lokesh further revealed that the CBFC felt the film’s core themes warranted an ‘A’ certificate. In particular, the depiction of electric cremation was cited as a significant factor in the board’s decision, as it was deemed unsuitable for a universal or parental guidance rating. The decision, however, came at a steep financial cost. The filmmaker said, “The board also stated that the film thematically falls under an A certificate due to the depiction of electric cremation. As a result of the A certificate, Coolie incurred an estimated loss of Rs. 40-50 crore.”</p>

<p><strong>About the film Coolie</strong><br />
<br />
To refresh your memory, Coolie featured an impressive star cast including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanths-coolie-director-lokesh-kanagaraj-takes-responsibility-for-films-criticism-promises-to-rectify-flaws-in-next-project-1399446">Rajinikanth</a>, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Soubin Shahir, Upendra, Shruti Haasan, Sathyaraj, and Rachita Ram.
