The Aamir Khan, Urmila Matondkar, and Jackie Shroff starrer hit the theatres on November 28, 2025, i.e., three decades. The film&#39;s leading lady spoke about what makes Rangeela a special film and whether the cult classic film can ever have a remake.</p>

<p><strong>Urmila Matondkar on what makes Rangeela special</strong><br />
In an interview with Hindustan Times, Urmila Matondkar mentioned how the film almost made time stand still at the point when it was released, and that very few movies get that place in people&#39;s hearts. She said, &ldquo;It&#39;s unbelievable how people remember the name of my character. When I&#39;m at the airport, they call me by my character&rsquo;s name. It comes out from the relatability factor that the characters had in the movie.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>If Rangeela can be remade</strong><br />
The 90&#39;s star believes that she is open to the idea of a remake of the cult film despite many fans considering Rangeela sacred. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-urmila-matondkar-talks-about-rangeela-reveals-chamma-chamma-couldve-gotten-her-hospitalised">Urmila Matondkar</a> went on to say, &ldquo;Each to their own. If somebody feels like they should do it, they should do it. What can I say? Cinema never belonged to anybody. In fact, nothing belongs to nobody. The movie doesn&#39;t belong to you anymore. Over the years, I have realised that the film is as much for each and every person who has seen it as it is mine. The minute I did it and I put it on there on celluloid, I became a different person than the girl who they are seeing on screen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, it&#39;s really a little silly and childish to think in an obsessive manner about your roles or of any work that you have done before. If anybody wants to do it, why not? More the merrier, but it is up to people to kind of judge how good or well it is done. It&#39;s absolutely welcome,&rdquo; ends the actor on a candid note.</p>

<p><strong>Rangeela&#39;s fond memories</strong><br />
While talking about the film&#39;s memories, she fondly remembered her time when she worked on it and said, &ldquo;Instead of memories, it&#39;s a big flash of happiness, excitement, thrill. Everything just comes to your mind the minute you say Rangeela.&rdquo;</p>

Following her entrance into the Indian entertainment industry, the actress has gained a fandom of her own. Amid all the rumors surrounding her personal life, she has risen above to participate in OTT shows and build a career for herself. Today, on her 29th birthday, we take a look at a few surprising and unknown facts about her.</p>

<p><strong>1. Child acting</strong><br />
Did you know that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/dhanashree-verma-addresses-negative-pr-for-her-and-how-respect-in-marriage-is-a-responsibility-post-divorce-from-yuzvendra-chahal-1396575">Dhanashree Verma</a> was a part of Karishma Kaa Karishma? Before stepping into acting for a big role, many may not be aware that she was among the many child actors in the famed children&rsquo;s show led by Jhanak Shukla. Her other dance ventures include participation in LSD 2: Love, S*x Aur Dhokha 2 (2024), Bali: Pyaar Chahiye (2021), and Jassie Gill &amp; Simar Kaur: Oye Hoye Hoye (2021).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Dentistry</strong><br />
Before kickstarting her life as a choreographer, Dhanashree Verma worked as a dentist at multiple clinics in Navi Mumbai. She made that possible thanks to her degree from the famed DY Patil Dental College. Among the many patients that she saw during her days in the field, one of the most famous ones happened to be actor Ranbir Kapoor, who visited for a consultation.</p>

<p><strong>3. Shiamak Davar&rsquo;s Disciple</strong><br />
While her career as the owner of the dance academy named Dhanashree Verma Company has worked fairly in her favor, it may not be known to many that she received training from the Bollywood star, Shiamak Davar, who has choreographed for many hit songs.</p>

<p><strong>4. Birthday twin with&nbsp;her mom</strong><br />
The dancer and reality TV star shares a birthday with her own mom! Sharing the happy news with her 6.1 million fans on Instagram, Dhanashree Verma called her birth-giver, her &lsquo;twin&rsquo;, and celebrated their happiness with moments from their past 29 years as the dedicated mother-daughter duo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Acting debut in Telugu Cinema</strong><br />
While her past work has been mostly behind the scenes, Dhanashree Verma is gearing up for her big screen appearance. All set to join the Telugu film Akasam Daati Vastaava, produced by Dil Raju, she will display both acting and dance in the project. Her acting debut is all set for an October premiere.</p>

The choreographer-turned-actress has participated in Ashneer Grover&rsquo;s reality show Rise and Fall. In the recent episode, she was heard talking about her ex-husband and revealed that she is not interested in love. She even touched on several topics, such as being disrespectful to the other person, etc.</p>

<h2 id="68becfc401a9d"><strong>Dhanashree Verma talks about ex-husband Yuzvendra Chahal</strong></h2>

<p>We all know that after the divorce, Dhanashree Verma has been labeled a gold digger by fans. This happened after Yuzvendra Chahal wore the &lsquo;be your own sugar daddy&rsquo; T-shirt. In fact, in an interview with Raj Shamani, he even revealed many issues in their marriage, which led to considerable discussion and criticism of the choreographer. Recently, in an episode of Rise and Fall, Verma spoke about taking responsibility for respecting the other person in a marriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sabke hath mein apni izzat hoti hai (Every person is responsible for their respect), and when you&rsquo;re in a marriage, you&rsquo;re responsible for the other person too, their respect also is your responsibility. I could have been disrespectful too, you think I don&rsquo;t have things to say, as a woman? But he was my husband, I respected him even when I was married, and I have to respect the fact, I was married to him,&rdquo; said Dhanashree. Further, the influencer revealed that she is not interested in love anymore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not cynical about love, maybe that&rsquo;s a harsh word, but I&rsquo;m not interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dhanashree Verma has been on the receiving end after the divorce. Talking about this, she said, &ldquo;If you want to portray yourself in a good light, we would let our work speak; why put somebody else down to clean your image?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verma also stated that the amount of negative PR done about her is not going to help Chahal or anybody, and it&rsquo;s simply a waste of time. She questioned, &ldquo;And why do you need to clean the image, when no one is saying anything? That&rsquo;s what denotes respect and maturity. You had a relationship at one point; how can you not respect it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dhanashree concluded by saying, &ldquo;When you know, no matter what I do, I am not going to be criticised, then you don&rsquo;t have a fear. We live in a country that we know supports will be favoured to one particular side, still, if you want to discuss that, then it&rsquo;s intentional, but it&rsquo;s okay, please, everyone be happy.&rdquo;</p>

The movie got very poor theatrical reports from critics and audiences alike. It sealed itself a disappointing fate, netting around Rs 100 crore in India and grossing approximately Rs 175 crore worldwide. While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/sikandar-movie-review-once-more-salman-khan-and-ar-murugadoss-but-this-time-do-better-1379855">Sikandar</a> didn&#39;t get the desired audience reception, it also suffered from rampant pre-release piracy.</p>

<p>Sikandar was leaked online, on the night prior to&nbsp;the movie release. The leak wasn&#39;t minor but it was a major, with infamous streaming sites like Tamilrockers, Movierulz and Filmyzilla having the pirated copy of the movie, that too&nbsp;in high definition.</p>

<p>Now, Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment is reportedly in the process of filing a massive insurance claim of Rs&nbsp;91 crore&nbsp;for piracy-related losses incurred following Sikandar&#39;s online leak. A&nbsp;reliable source close to the development, told to Bollywood Hungama, &quot;An audit was commissioned to assess the extent of the leak and the resulting impact on revenue. Ernst &amp; Young (EnY) submitted a comprehensive report that pegged the loss at approximately Rs. 91 crore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As per industry insiders,&nbsp;the Rs&nbsp;91 crore figure was derived by taking into consideration, the pre-release box office projections and the&nbsp;theatre-wise occupancy trends, and region-wise earnings dips following the leak. Also, digital footprint tracing tools were&nbsp;reportedly used to track the volume of illegal downloads across all platforms, for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/sikandar-ott-release-salman-khans-power-packed-actioner-to-drop-digitally-on-this-date-heres-what-we-know-1388953">Salman Khan</a> starrer</p>

<p>The pirated version of Sikandar was very different from&nbsp;the censor copy that played in theatres. A lot of scenes in the pirated print didn&#39;t have polished VFX. Also, there were scenes in the pirated copy that were not part of the final cut.</p>

<p>It is to be seen if NGE goes ahead with the&nbsp;piracy insurance claim. If they go ahead with it, it will be interesting to see how much of the claimed amount is recovered. All eyes shall be on this new development that has got everyone in Bollywood intrigued.</p>

<p>Talking about NGE, the busy production house, after Sikandar in Eid, already released their next&nbsp;film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/100-crore-box-office-club-akshay-kumars-housefull-5-becomes-the-109th-bollywood-feature-to-grace-the-coveted-list-1391205">Housefull 5</a> over the Bakri Eid weekend. They are now working to release Baaghi 4 in September.</p>

Actress reveals]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/410409769_palak-3.jpg"></img><p>Bollywood actress and Shweta Tiwari&rsquo;s daughter <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/palak-tiwari-serves-holiday-glam-with-a-sassy-twist-in-a-bright-red-ribbed-mini-dress-1362630">Palak Tiwari</a> made her acting debut with Salman Khan&rsquo;s film Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. She has carved her niche in the industry and has become quite famous. She was recently seen in The Bhootnii alongside Sanjay Dutt. Palak began her acting career around the same time as other star kids like Ibrahim Ali Khan, Suhana Khan, and Ananya Panday. Now, she has opened up on whether she feels &ldquo;pressured&rdquo; seeing their performances.</p>

<p>In a recent chat with Mashable India, Palak Tiwari was asked whether she feels any performance pressure, given that she&rsquo;s surrounded by fellow young actors like Suhana Khan, Ananya Panday, and Ibrahim Ali Khan, as&nbsp;they all debuted around the same time.</p>

<p>She shared, &ldquo;I think mujhe pressure har koi daalta hai mummy ke liye hi. Par mein pressure na lene ki puri koshish karti hu. Kyunki aap pressure leke kaam karoge toh phir bhi kaam acha nahi hoga, toh kya fayda pressure leke kaam karne ka. (I think everyone tried to put pressure on me because of my mother. However, I try not to take any pressure. If you work under pressure, things won&rsquo;t turn out to be good. Hence, there&rsquo;s no use in getting pressurized).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Palak also spoke about her connection with acting, describing it as a form of therapy. She revealed that becoming an actor had been her dream since childhood, and just the thought of performing in front of the camera brings her joy. When she&#39;s acting, she added, her mind feels completely clear, and no other thoughts distract&nbsp;her.</p>

<p>The Bhootnii actress added, &ldquo;This is the happiest moment of my life. Mera sapna pura hogaya. Toh mein baaki logon ki kyu sochu.&rdquo; (My dream has been fulfilled, now why should I get bothered by anyone else).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Palak Tiwari also described her peers as &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; and acknowledged that they&rsquo;re navigating tough times, admitting that making a name for themselves as young newcomers in the industry is challenging.</p>

<p>On the work front, Palak Tiwari was recently seen in the supernatural romance <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/the-bhootnii-box-office-collection-day-5-sanjay-dutts-horror-comedy-nets-rs-15-lakh-on-1st-monday-1385972">The Bhootnii</a>.

<p>Yes, you heard that right! In a recent conversation with Instant Bollywood, Sunita Ahuja shared, &ldquo;Ek hero ki biwi hona, aapko patthar ka dil banana padta hai. Aap dekhte ho hero humare se zyada to heroine logo ke saath rehte hain.&rdquo; (Being the wife of a film star, you have to have a heart of stone. You see them spending more time with their heroines than with us).</p>

<p>Govinda&rsquo;s wife also talked about trust in a relationship and admitted that having no trust in a partner will ruin one&rsquo;s life. She highlighted how crucial it is not to let insecurities take over, especially in a long marriage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pointing to the value of commitment and perspective, she questioned how one could sustain a relationship for 30 to 40 years without focusing on the bigger picture</p>

<p>Sunita also opened up about the time when she embraced motherhood and revealed that the actor wasn&#39;t there&nbsp;with her. She shared he was mostly away for shoots during her delivery of both their children Tina and Yashvardhan. Sunita Ahuja added that she was staying with her mother-in-law at that time as she couldn&rsquo;t travel with their little ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also gave credit for her understanding of family to Govinda&rsquo;s mother and she shaped her thoughts while staying together. She proudly shared that the actor had a deep love for his mother, driven by fear and that he never did anything wrong in his life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Govinda tied the knot with Sunita Ahuja in 1987. The duo are proud parents to two children Tina Ahuja and Yashvardhan Ahuja. Tina made her acting debut in 2015 with Second Hand Husband.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harshvardhan will soon be making his acting debut with Sai Rajesh&#39;s directorial. He has assisted in films like Dishoom, Baaghi, and Salman Khan&#39;s upcoming film Kick 2.</p>

Here's the truth ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/28526380_vicky-kaushal.jpg"></img><p>Vicky Kaushal is on cloud nine ever since he delivered a Rs 500 crore grosser at the Indian box office. The actor has proved his acting mettle time and again and&nbsp;established himself among the most bankable young stars. Ever since Chaavaa was released and emerged as a true-blue blockbuster, Vicky has been receiving multiple exciting offers. Currently, social media is buzzing with the news of Kaushal entering the popular YRF spy universe. However, the reports are vague and untrue!</p>

<p>As per a source close to the development,<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-buzz-kartik-aaryan-or-vicky-kaushal-to-spearhead-amaran-director-rajkumar-periasamys-hindi-debut-1385966"> Vicky Kaushal </a>is not joining the spy universe. The production banner definitely has a plan to expand the spyverse with the inclusion of new actors playing different characters, but nothing is concrete with Vicky Kaushal as of now.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Yash Raj Films is primarily focusing on&nbsp;the War 2 release&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Yash Raj Films is fully invested in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-150-shooting-days-six-action-scenes-five-countries-two-songs-two-superstars-one-mission-war-2-details-revealed-1388458">War 2</a>, starring Hrithik Roshan, Kiara Advani, and Jr NTR. The movie is gearing up for release on August 14, coinciding with the Independence Day weekend. It is also clashing with Lokesh Kanagaraj-Rajinikanth&rsquo;s film Coolie. While the teaser of War 2 received a positive reception, the makers are set to begin the promotional campaign soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next spy universe movie from YRF will be Alpha, starring Alia Bhatt and Sharvari. Reportedly, Bobby Deol is playing a crucial role in the movie. Directed by Shiv Rawail, Alpha is locked to release on Christmas 2025, marking the first female-led spy movie of the popular cinematic universe.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Vicky Kaushal&#39;s upcoming movies&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>On the other hand, Vicky Kaushal is presently busy with the production of Sanjay Leela Bhansali&rsquo;s Love &amp; War, co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt. He also has Mahavatar in his kitty, where he will be seen donning the character of Lord Parasuram. If made well, the mythological epic drama has the potential to match the glory of his latest release, Chhaava. &nbsp;</p>

She celebrated her 50th birthday with&nbsp;husband, Raj Kundra, sister Shamita Shetty, along&nbsp;with&nbsp;their other family members in Croatia. A few days after the celebration, a video of Shilpa indulging in a heated argument&nbsp;went viral. Raj Kundra has now called the experience &#39;deeply frustrating&#39;.</p>

<p>In a new conversation&nbsp;with Hindustan Times, Raj Kundra broke his silence on the viral video and shared his experience of visiting a&nbsp;restaurant in Croatia. Kundra revealed that he had booked the table a year in advance for Shilpa Shetty&#39;s birthday. However, they discovered that the table had been given to another group.</p>

<p>When Shilpa and her family raised concerns about the &quot;double-booking error&quot;, they were asked&nbsp;to keep quiet,&nbsp;leaving the celebrity couple disappointed. This&nbsp;escalated the situation, turning into a heated argument.</p>

<p>&quot;As someone who has also run restaurants, I found the handling of the situation deeply frustrating, especially with my elderly parents, mother-in-law, and 20 guests left waiting,&quot; Kundra said.</p>

<p>Raj Kundra described his&nbsp;feelings by saying that he planned a special evening for his family; however, it turned out to be unnecessarily stressful. Reportedly, the incident occurred on June 9, 2025, in Hvar Island, Croatia, a day after the 50th birthday celebration&nbsp;of the Dhadkan actress.</p>

<p>The Instagram user who posted the viral video claims that the couple had a&nbsp;heated quarrel with a foreigner who was enjoying her meal at the restaurant. The user also alleged that when the foreigner asked them to lower their volume, Kundra&nbsp;replied to her by saying, &quot;You don&#39;t know who we are.&quot;</p>

<p>The video in discussion doesn&#39;t have clear visuals of the couple and their family members. However, it&nbsp;features a loud voice with someone shouting,&nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t talk to us, we don&#39;t want to hear you.&quot;</p>

<p>On the work front, Shilpa Shetty was last seen in the film Sukhee in 2023. The actress is now gearing up for KD- The Devil. She has been married to Raj Kundra for&nbsp;16 years. The couple tied the knot on November 22, 2009. They welcomed their son&nbsp;Viaan Raj Kundra&nbsp;in 2012. Their daughter, Samisha Shetty Kundra, was born via surrogacy in 2020.</p>

<p>We are sure that many of you are rooting to see Sachiv Ji and Rinki&rsquo;s romance angle in season 4.

For this, we will have to wait till season 4 drops.</p>

Amid the dating rumors with actress Shivangi Verma, the actor&nbsp;has revealed the truth behind their viral picture. The veteran actor also shared how it started a rumor about his married life as well.</p>

<p>In a new&nbsp;interview with ETimes, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranbir-kapoor-is-more-appealing-than-rishi-kapoor-claims-govind-namdev-heres-what-he-said-about-ranveer-singh-1370457">Govind Namdev</a> recently addressed the rumors of dating a younger actress. Namdev revealed that the picture in question was a part of their professional publicity strategy for their upcoming movie, Gaurishankar Goharganj Wale.</p>

<p>While the OMG- O My God! actor agreed to do&nbsp;it, he claimed that the 30-year-old actress &quot;tagged the film in a certain way&quot; without informing him. Namdev shared that the actor&nbsp;was upset about how people started speculating about them, which he didn&#39;t appreciate. So much so that he stopped talking to her, as he didn&#39;t want to get involved in &quot;unnecessary drama.&quot;</p>

<p>Govind Namdev also opened up about how the viral post started a rumor about&nbsp;his married life. &quot;There were rumors that my household was affected and me and my wife were considering living separately,&quot; the 70-year-old actor said.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that Govind Namdev has clarified their photo in the discussion. After the picture went viral, in December 2024, the senior actor posted the same image on his Instagram handle. He penned a lengthy note along with it, while mentioning that&nbsp;the picture&nbsp;is not a part of his &#39;real&#39; life.</p>

<p>The viral photo was first posted by his co-star Shivangi Verma on Instagram last year. Verma&nbsp;captioned it as &quot;Pyaar knows no age, no limits.&quot;</p>

<p>Punjabi singer and rapper Sidhu Moosewala, one of the most influential artists of all time,&nbsp;was shot dead at the age of 28 in Mansa,&nbsp;Punjab, in 2022. Three years after his&nbsp;untimely demise, a&nbsp;documentary on the late singer&nbsp;has been released on YouTube amid a court case over its screening. Also, three new songs are out as a tribute to him.</p>

<p>The BBC World Service&nbsp;on Wednesday released a documentary on Sidhu Moosewala on YouTube, coinciding with the birth anniversary of&nbsp;the late Punjabi singer. It is out in&nbsp;two episodes which covers his early life, rise to fame, controversies, and murder. This comes ahead of its&nbsp;scheduled screening in Mumbai this afternoon, for which a controversy has erupted over its release.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Sidhu Moosewala&#39;s father, Balkaur Singh Sidhu, has filed a petition in a court in Mansa, Punjab, seeking a stay on&nbsp;the screening. Singh, who&nbsp;has strongly opposed the screening, claims that the documentary was made without his permission and alleges that it features false content about his late son&#39;s murder, the Indian Express reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sidhu Moosewala&#39;s three new songs have been out on his official YouTube channel to remember the late Punjabi singer. The new tracks, titled 0008,&nbsp;Neal, and&nbsp;Take Notes, are part of an extended play&nbsp;called&nbsp;Moose Print. A&nbsp;total of 11 songs have been added to the channel posthumously, including the new ones.</p>

<p>Sidhu Moosewala was born on June 11, 1993, in Moosa village in Mansa district of&nbsp;Punjab.&nbsp;The 28-year-old singer and rapper had garnered a great fan following over the years. His&nbsp;popular songs include&nbsp;Old Skool, So High, Same Beef, Legend, and many more.</p>

<p>Moosewala was murdered by unidentified assailants on May 29, 2022, while he was travelling in his car. His assassination sent shockwaves across the nation and globally back then, leaving family and fans in grief.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the luxury bungalow is near completion, and the celebrity couple is set to move in soon. Here&rsquo;s all you need to know about the mansion and whether it is costlier than Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s Mannat.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s new luxury mansion is now Bandra&rsquo;s new crown</strong></h3>

<p>Located at Pali Hill&rsquo;s platinum belt, it is a 6-storey mansion with rooftop gardens and vine-draped balconies. The mansion has been under construction for years, and Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, and Neetu Kapoor have overseen every design and architect. It is now Bandra&rsquo;s crown as the royal mansion has beaten Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s popular residence.</p>

<p>According to Business Today, the property is worth Rs 250 crore, making it the costliest celebrity residence in Mumbai, beating Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s Rs 200 crore worth Mannat and Amitabh Bachchan&rsquo;s Jalsa of Rs 120 crore.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the newly constructed home is registered in Ranbir-Alia&rsquo;s baby girl&rsquo;s name, Raha Kapoor, which adds an emotional touch to the property.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>History of Ranbir Kapoor&rsquo;s new bungalow</strong></h3>

<p>The property has a long history! The plot on which <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranbir-kapoor-gears-up-for-6-feature-films-from-2026-to-2029-from-ramayana-to-animal-park-dhoom-4-1358140">Ranbir Kapoor</a>&rsquo;s new mansion is situated originally belonged to Raj Kapoor and Krishan Raj Kapoor (Ranbir&rsquo;s grandparents). It was inherited by Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor in the 1980s and has now been registered under the name of the Kapoor clan&rsquo;s future generation, Raha.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the mansion is almost ready, there is still work left. The couple is expected to shift to their luxury residence soon on an auspicious date.</p>

<p>On the work front, Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt will be next seen together in Love And War, slated to hit the screens in mid-2026.

The actor-director, who found love again after his divorce from Malaika Arora, got married in 2023 and has been enjoying a happy married life with&nbsp;Sshura Khan. The&nbsp;two often set the internet mushing over their cute romance, and we are always in awe. This is for the first time after the reports of pregnancy surfaced that Salman Khan&#39;s brother has opened up about being a dad again.</p>

<p>Talking to Delhi Times, Arbaaz Khan confessed that he is nervous. Defending himself, he stated that everyone tends to be nervous at this stage. The Dabangg 2&nbsp;director also admitted that he is becoming a father after quite some time now, hence it is a fresh feeling for him all over again.</p>

<p>Arbaaz concluded by saying, &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it, and it&#39;s giving me a new sense of happiness and responsibility. I&#39;m kind of liking that.&quot;</p>

<p>The rumors of pregnancy began after Sshura Khan was spotted outside a maternity clinic. The couple initially kept it under wraps. In fact, to date, they haven&#39;t made any official announcement about it. However, now that the actor has spoken about his wife and her pregnancy, we can expect an official announcement soon.</p>

<p>On the work front, as per reports by The Times of India, Khan is working on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/dabangg-4-exclusive-arbaaz-khan-says-he-and-salman-khan-want-to-do-the-film-with-a-lot-of-love-and-effort-1197936" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Dabangg 4</a>&nbsp;as a producer. He might also be seen playing the role of Makhanchand Pandey in the film. In an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, he said that the anticipated film is definitely in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Arbaaz added, &quot;We are going to do it. The period between Dabangg 3 and 4 won&#39;t be as long as between the second and third instalments. It won&#39;t take very long. But yes, we both need to get out of our engagements to which we have committed prior, and then maybe sit, lock ourselves thinking, and work on it.&quot;</p>

However, if you missed it, do not worry. We have got you covered. From Karan Johar breaking his silence on fallout with Kartik Aaryan to Aamir Khan&rsquo;s Sitaare Zameen Par to release on 1,250 screens, here&rsquo;s a look at today&rsquo;s top Bollywood news!</p>

<p><strong>Here are the top 5 headlines of June 10, 2025</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Karan Johar on feud with Kartik Aaryan</strong></p>

<p>Karan Johar recently opened up on the fallout with Kartik Aaryan. In a recent conversation with Bollywood Hungama, KJo shared, &ldquo;We internally discussed and worked it out, and we let bygones be bygones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;He and I met, decided to come together. It was all lovely and he&#39;s had I&#39;ve had we all had our issues with each other, but it&#39;s a tiny industry, which I call a family, and I believe within a family, kabhi kabhi gile sikwe ho jate hain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>2. Sitaare Zameen Par to release in 1,250 screens?</strong></p>

<p>Aamir Khan&rsquo;s Sitaare Zameen Par is all set to hit the theaters on June 20. A source close to the development told exclusively to Pinkvilla, &ldquo;The makers were exploring several release ideas, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-aamir-khan-to-release-of-sitaare-zameen-par-on-1200-screens-set-for-a-platform-release-1391102">the plan at the moment is to bring the film out&nbsp;approximately 1250 screens</a>. Aamir Khan is confident of the film, and is well aware of&nbsp;the change in audience dynamics, which is the reason why he is looking at a longer game than a shorter one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>3. Karan Johar says Ranbir Kapoor has &#39;best PR game&#39;</strong></p>

<p>In a conversation with Bollywood Hungama, Karan Johar was asked who he thinks has the best PR team. The filmmaker replied, &ldquo;I think everyone kind of understands it well. But can I say who I think is the best star who has managed to stay away from social media, from the arc light and still emerged as a massive superstar &mdash; Ranbir Kapoor. He doesn&rsquo;t have a PR team, he therefore has the best PR team.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>4. Housefull 3 vs Housefull 5 first 5 days collection</strong></p>

<p>Akshay Kumar&rsquo;s Housefull 5 weekday trend has a huge difference from Housefull 4 as the latter was released during Diwali holidays. Housefull 4 started earning well&nbsp;after the first 5 days, which might make the collection of the new film&nbsp;cross the previous installment. However, comparing Housefull 3 and 5 is quite ideal as they hit the theaters around similar periods.</p>

<p>But, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/housefull-3-vs-housefull-5-day-wise-box-office-comparison-how-is-akshay-kumars-new-comedy-performing-compared-to-its-2016-counterpart-1391112">Housefull 5 definitely earned much more than Housefull 3</a> and is going with the expected collection of Rs 8.75 crore on June 10. The recent release will collect a total of Rs 99 crore in the first 5 days. Meanwhile, Housefull 3 earned Rs 68.65 crore.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Karan Johar defends Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor</strong></p>

<p>Nadaaniyan, starring Ibrahim Ali Khan and Khushi Kapoor, faced backlash after&nbsp;its release. Now, in an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Karan Johar defended the stars and shared, &ldquo;I will stand by Nadaaniyan, till kingdom come. And I will tell you even today that Ibrahim and Khushi worked very, very hard. Shauna Gautam, the director of the film, worked supremely hard. Everyone put their best foot forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shared his strong belief that Ibrahim and Khushi have a bright future&nbsp;in the industry. According to him, both are putting in serious effort, learning from missteps, and constantly sharpening their skills. He added that they&rsquo;re truly meant for showbiz and will thrive in it. He also assured that he&rsquo;ll always be there to support them as a mentor and guide.</p>

He has been married to Sunita Ahuja for more than 30 years. Like every other time, Sunita has again hit the headlines due to her bold confessions and unapologetic attitude. In a recent interview with Instant Bollywood, Sunita revealed the sole reason behind her fights with husband Govinda. She pointed out how people around him intentionally don&rsquo;t let him realize&nbsp;his worth.</p>

<p>She stressed that Govinda not working is the only reason why&nbsp;she engages in a fight with him. &quot;Main usko bolti hu, tu kaam kar. Public tujhe miss kar rhi hai. Main bolti hun tu weight lose kar kam se kam 20 kgs. Usne mujhe 6-7 saal pehle bola tha ke main Sylvester Stallone banke dikhaunga, kyunki he is one of my favourite actor. Maine kaha woh is janam mein toh hone nahi wala, agle janam mein tu mujhe pati ke roop mein nahi, bete ke roop mein chahiye,&quot; said Sunita.</p>

<p>&quot;(I tell him to work. The audience is missing you. I also ask him to lose weight, at least 20 kilos. He told me 6-7 years ago that he would lose weight and become like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/fitness/sylvester-stallone-workout-1240864">Sylvester Stallone</a> because he&#39;s one of my favourite actors. I told him, that&#39;s not going to happen in this life. In the next life, I don&#39;t want you as a husband but as a son).&quot;</p>

<p>Sunita Ahuja went on to add that Govinda has been wasting his time because of the people around him. Blaming his social circle, she highlighted that these&nbsp;people misguide him as they benefit from the Partner actor.

Debuted in 2011, the actor worked as an AD on his own film and struggled to do kissing scenes on-screen. He is now considered one of the biggest crowd pullers, whose horror-comedy franchise has a dedicated fan base. Yes, we are talking about none other than Kartik Aaryan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Born on November 22, 1990, to a Brahmin family in Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh), <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kartik-aaryan-and-anurag-basu-gear-up-to-launch-a-teaser-of-their-yet-untitled-musical-diwali-2025-release-1387828">Kartik Aaryan </a>is among the leading stars in Bollywood today. The actor holds a strong fan base and is carrying a successful film career. His debut film, Pyaar Ka Punchnama, was released in 2011 by filmmaker Luv Ranjan.</p>

<p>Though the movie was a decent performer at the box office, Kartik was applauded for his performance. He worked as an Assistant director on his third film, Kaanchi, directed by Subhash Ghai. The actor faced difficulty in doing kissing scenes. Reportedly, he gave around 37 retakes for a passionate kissing sequence in Kaanchi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his initial years, Kartik Aaryan was identified as a &lsquo;monologue actor&rsquo; because he used to have long monologues in movies&mdash;Pyaar Ka Punchnama, Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, and Pati Patni Aur Woh. While his monologues used to have a virality factor, they were also criticised for being misogynistic. After facing backlash, the makers of Pati Patni Aur Woh decided to remove his monologue from the final edit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His breakthrough movie was the 2018 release Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, which was his first ever Rs 100 crore net grosser in India. The super success of SKTKS put him on the national map, and he became the new sensation in the tinsel town. Kartik never looked back since then and has given several hits and Superhit movies, including Luka Chuppi, Pati Patni Aur Woh, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kartik Aaryan&#39;s highest grossing movie is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/bhool-bhulaiyaa-3-exclusive-director-anees-bazmee-reveals-how-vidya-balan-came-on-board-as-manjulika-shares-her-reaction-after-hearing-script-1353039">Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3</a>, directed by Anees Bazmee. While fans wait for its fourth installment, Kartik has an exciting slate of releases ahead:&nbsp;an untitled romantic film with Anurag Basu co-starring Sreeleela, Tu Meri Main Tera Main Tera Tu Meri with Sameer Vidwans co-starring Ananya Panday, and Pati Patni Aur Woh 2. The actor also had a fallout with Karan Johar; however, they made up and reunited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, there were reports that Anil Kapoor declined Housefull 5 due to remuneration issues. There were also reports that Boman Irani was offered the role of Batook Patel (played by Johny Lever) in the film. However, things couldn&rsquo;t be finalized.</p>

His storytelling is not only impactful but also influential. However, the filmmaker isn&#39;t someone who hasn&#39;t faced any legal challenges due to his movies. In a recent conversation with The Hollywood Reporter India, Imtiaz Ali shared how a sequence in his popular film Jab We Met led to a non-bailable warrant being issued for him and put him in legal trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the fan interaction, the Tamasha director was asked whether he makes his movies without compromising his thoughts and vision, or has to modify or amend things to avoid offending a section of the audience.</p>

<p>The filmmaker quipped that he usually asks himself several times whether it can hurt someone or offend a community. If he is convinced that his true intent of showing something isn&#39;t hurtful in any way, then he sticks to that; otherwise, he modifies the scenario.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While addressing this, Imtiaz shared an interesting incident when he was embroiled in controversy. There was a court summons against him as he was accused of showing Ratlam in a bad light in Jab We Met. The director said, &quot;The first time there was a court summon for me and then I had a non-bailable arrest warrant, because of Ratlam (he laughs).&quot;</p>

<p>The filmmaker went on to add that the chargesheet filed against him stated that the place, which was famous for snacks, had been defamed by director Imtiaz Ali as a place of red light.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-imtiaz-alis-next-with-fahadh-faasil-and-triptii-dimri-titled-idiots-of-istanbul-1361961">Imtiaz </a>further mentioned that he was shooting for Love Aaj Kal when Producer Dinesh Vijan came and informed him about the case and the non-bailable warrant. He said, &quot;I was shooting in Calcutta (Kolkata) and Dino comes and says- Sir, there is a non-bailable arrest warrant. If they know where you are, they will come and arrest you. I said kal hi paper me aaya we&#39;re shooting over here in Calcutta yaar and wo location bhi unhone bata diya hai to wo to aane wale hain (laughs), Dino was like mera to bahut loss ho jayega.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding more to the funny incident, Imtiaz said while everyone on the sets was tensed, there was Dolly Ahluwalia who started saying - Main apne haathon se roti bana kar laungi, aapko salakhon ke beech se khilaungi Imtiaz ji. Aap ghabrana mat (I will bring you food when you are behind bars. Don&#39;t worry).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, the red light sequence in Jab We Met often goes viral on social media. The movie starred <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shahid-kapoors-fees-for-farzi-2-will-blow-your-mind-its-the-biggest-amount-in-his-career-1386832">Shahid Kapoor</a> and Kareena Kapoor Khan in the lead roles.&nbsp;</p>

Details inside]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/69089070_srk-gauri-rent-another-flat.jpg"></img><p>It is no secret that Shah Rukh Khan and his family are no longer residing in their iconic Mumbai abode, Mannat. This was after their residence went under renovation earlier this year. The residence was also home to several staff members who took care of the Khan family. And now, the latest reports suggest that Gauri Khan has rented a flat for her staff members in Mumbai&rsquo;s Khar area.</p>

<p>According to reports from Zapkey.com, as cited by News 18, Gauri has reportedly rented a flat in Pankaj Society for Rs 1.35 lakh to accommodate her staff members. This society is located in one of Mumbai&rsquo;s well-known residential spots and is just 100 metres away from another duplex apartment she had rented right after Mannat went under renovation.</p>

<p>The reports further reveal that the rented flat is located on the 4th floor of the building and measures approximately 725 sq ft. It has been rented from Sanjay Kishor Ramani, and apart from the rent, a security deposit of Rs 4.05 lakh is also paid. According to reports, this agreement is for three years and promises a 5 percent rent hike every year.</p>

<p>Earlier, there were reports that Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s wife has rented two duplexes in Khar&rsquo;s Pali Hill for Rs 8.67 crore. This is also for 3 years.</p>

<p>The renovation work had landed the Khan family in trouble somewhere around March. According to a report by Bar &amp; Bench on Monday, activist Santosh Daundkar had filed a plea with the National Green Tribunal (NGT), claiming that&nbsp;Shah Rukh Khan&nbsp;and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) did not secure the necessary Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance for the renovation of Mannat. Given that the bungalow is classified as a Grade III heritage structure, any modifications require official approval.</p>

<p>The report also stated that Khan&nbsp;intended to add two additional floors to his six-storey bungalow. It also alleges that he converted twelve 1-BHK flats, designated initially for mass housing, into a single-family residence.</p>

<p>Talking about his work front, Shah Rukh Khan is all set to shoot for King, which will also star his daughter, Suhana Khan, and Deepika Padukone.</p>

Right when the Laal Pari song was released, it landed itself in a controversy after getting a copyright claim. Yo Yo Honey Singh had sold its rights to several music labels, which forced the producer Sajid Nadiadwala to buy the rights from all of them.</p>

<p>After resolving this, the makers, specifically this song, have now fallen prey to yet another fresh controversy. A popular content creator, Sandip Brahamin, has accused the makers of copying his step in the song.</p>

<h2 id="68caa4b54ee63"><strong>Who is Sandip Brahamin?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Sandip Brahamin is a 22-year-old content creator who has gained popularity on social media due to his dance videos. He is known by his stage name &lsquo;Popping Sandy&rsquo;. After winning Romania&rsquo;s Got Talent season 13 in 2023, he gained international recognition and also received a prize money of 10,000 Euros.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before winning the reality show, he used to dance on the streets and in shopping malls. But now, he trains kids to dance like him. Sandip loved Romania so much because of the warmth of the people there that he decided to settle in that country itself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="68caa4b54ee6e"><strong>What is the Laal Pari controversy?</strong></h2>

<p>The content creator often puts his dance videos on his Instagram handle. Right after Housefull 5&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/housefull-5-exclusive-sajid-nadiadwala-faces-unexpected-hurdles-over-laal-pari-amidst-confusion-with-yo-yo-honey-singh-t-series-1386893">Laal Pari</a> was released, he shared a video that grabbed all the attention.</p>

<p>The dancer claims that the makers have copied his signature dance moves in the song.&nbsp;He pointed out a specific head-shaking hook-step that matches a step he always does in his dance videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The influencer even went on to share a comparison video that is coming to notice now and grabbing all eyeballs.&nbsp;He said, &ldquo;You all have seen my signature moves. My move has been copied in the Housefull 5 song Laal Pari. Many of my friends DMed me on Instagram. Therefore, I rechecked on Instagram and YouTube. They&rsquo;ve neither mentioned me nor given me credit. I don&rsquo;t know what is happening.&rdquo;</p>

He has a huge fan following not only in India but outside the country as well. Whoever meets SRK, gets mesmerized&nbsp;by&nbsp;his kindness and gentlemanly behavior. Even his co-stars can&rsquo;t stop praising him. He is also known as the romance king and the reason is evident in his films. Let&rsquo;s look back at the time when his Main Hoon Na co-star Sushmita Sen opened up on magical moments from the sets and shared that he can even romance pillars.</p>

<p>Yes, you heard that right! Back in 2020, in an interview with Bollywood Hungama, Sushmita Sen reminisced about her experience working with Shah Rukh Khan on Main Hoon Na, describing it as truly unforgettable. She highlighted how SRK was not just a co-star but a caring presence on set, always ensuring his female colleagues felt comfortable and well looked after. His thoughtful and graceful approach made everyone feel at home, turning the shoot into a magical experience.</p>

<p>She added, &ldquo;SRK had once said that he can romance pillars and that is true. Some of the most magical moments in Main Hoon Na were not scripted, SRK made them come to life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actress further shared, &ldquo;Like in the introduction, he is not supposed to come on in his scenes and open his arms when Chandni walks&nbsp;in. He did that on the spot and it became iconic. Like that there are lots of lovely moments. He is one of my most loved co-stars, I am a big fan of SRK too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Shah Rukh Khan will next be seen in the much-awaited film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-reunites-with-shah-rukh-khan-on-king-filming-begins-on-may-20-1388022">King</a>.

Though the duo never confirmed their relationship, they were seen sharing a hug and posing together at the screening of Gram Chikitsalay. Now, Amol opened up on the relationship for the very first time and shared how Vicky Kaushal was stuck in a similar situation while dating Katrina Kaif.</p>

<p>In a recent conversation with Hindustan Times, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/gram-chikitsalay-did-amol-parashar-feel-overshadowed-by-vinay-pathak-during-shoot-actor-jokes-his-scenes-felt-dull-1386056">Amol Parashar</a> opened up on relationship rumors with Konkona Sensharma and shared that everyone began assuming that they were dating, but nobody came and asked him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, he added that he doesn&rsquo;t get affected and has moved on from the rumors. He also emphasized that if anything ever happens, he&rsquo;ll be the one to share it on social media himself.</p>

<p>The Gram Chikitsalay actor shared his perspective on relationships, saying that closeness varies from person to person and not every bond needs a label. He added that what truly matters to him is mutual happiness, both partners and their families being content.</p>

<p>Amol also reflected on a similar past moment during the shoot of Sardar Udham, when rumors of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-buzz-kartik-aaryan-or-vicky-kaushal-to-spearhead-amaran-director-rajkumar-periasamys-hindi-debut-1385966">Vicky Kaushal</a> dating Katrina Kaif were doing the rounds on social media. He shared, &ldquo;I remember something similar happening with Vicky, and I was like: &lsquo;Bhai, bata do sabko because people are asking me&rsquo;. And he was like: &lsquo;I will, at the right time&rsquo;,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amol Parashar also finds it amusing that his personal life attracts more buzz than his professional life. He jokes that no matter how much acting he does, it&rsquo;s always the link-up rumors that grab the spotlight.</p>

<p>The actor further opened up on&nbsp;his thoughts on marriage and shared that while his mother used to &#39;pressurize&#39; him initially, she has eased off lately. He shared that anything can happen, and he enjoys keeping life unpredictable, something his family is well aware of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If and when he ties the knot, he joked that it&rsquo;ll be Instagram official, since that&rsquo;s what seems to matter most these days. For now, he has nothing new to share on the&nbsp;front.</p>

The movie not only impressed the audience but also emerged as a big money spinner at the box office, despite opening low.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, not many know that Shah Rukh Khan wasn&#39;t the first choice to play the lead role of&nbsp;Hockey coach Kabir Khan in Chak De India, but it was offered to Salman Khan. So, let&#39;s find out the reason why the sports drama couldn&#39;t materialize&nbsp;with Salman Khan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few media reports claimed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-salman-khan-confirms-apoorva-lakhias-next-from-july-in-talks-with-kabir-khan-1388154">Salman Khan</a> had asked for a hefty remuneration for Chak De India. Because of the same,&nbsp;Aditya Chopra didn&#39;t work with him until Ek Tha Tiger (2012), where the Megastar signed on his terms.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>When Salman Khan revealed reason behind turning down Chak De India</strong></h3>

<p>During Sultan promotions in 2016, when Salman Khan was asked why he turned down Chak De, the actor jokingly said, &ldquo;I left it because even Shah Rukh Khan should be a part of a few great films.&rdquo; Furthermore, the actor mentioned that at that time, his image was not appropriate to play a sports coach like Kabir Khan. He pointed out that he left the movie due to the heroic expectations he carries among fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was offered Chak De, my image was totally different as I was doing Partner and all those kinds of films. My only thing in Chak De was that my fans would expect me to wear a wig and win the match for India, which would not go for the film. That was not my genre at that point in time,&rdquo; expressed Salman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actor highlighted that Chak De India was inclined towards serious cinema and had fewer commercial aspects. He said, &ldquo;It was a more serious kind of film and I was doing more of a commercial kind of cinema which I am still doing. I would never move out of the commercial cinema zone but it is just that there would be a lot of meaningful cinema in the commercial zone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Chak De India was directed by Shimit Amin. Released in 2007, the movie emerged as the second highest grosser of the year, only behind Om Shanti Om.&nbsp;</p>

He also expressed happiness for the actress to be in a position to ask for it.</p>

<p>The Thug Life creator spoke on behalf of the filmmakers in general and stated that such considerations will always play a role during casting. Mani Ratnam&nbsp;also highlighted how Deepika&rsquo;s request wasn&rsquo;t unreasonable but rather a necessity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He stressed the importance of acknowledging and accommodating such needs, especially when it comes to balancing personal responsibilities with professional commitments.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Deepika Padukone was reportedly impressed with the storyline of Spirit and the way her character was developed. She soon agreed to join the film. However, things didn&rsquo;t go as planned, and she had to exit the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per reports, she demanded Rs 40 crore as fees from the makers, but they had a budget of Rs 20 crore. She also asked for a fixed schedule to ensure she had sufficient time to balance her professional commitments and her personal life. But her demands weren&rsquo;t met by the producers and directors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She was also asked to learn Telugu. Keeping all these factors in mind, the actress exited the film. Soon, Triptii Dimri was roped in, replacing her.&nbsp;</p>

A couple of weeks back, his back-to-back blank tweets became the topic of discussion among fans.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just his tweets that garnered attention, but also his health that made&nbsp;the news. In his blog numbered &lsquo;6222&rsquo; published on February 28, 2025, the Paa actor spoke about multiple meetings and dealing with the tough task of deciding what work to take and refuse politely.

<p>Talking about facing age-related complications, Senior Bachchan expressed, &ldquo;As you age it&rsquo;s not just the hurdle of the lines one has to memorise, it&rsquo;s the multiple age-related contingencies that need to be followed to be able to deliver content as asked.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s only when he returns home that he realises the &ldquo;several errors made and how to repair them.&rdquo;</p>

An actor who actually wanted to become a director, trained under Satyajit Ray for the same, but also ended up portraying some of the most iconic roles on the silver screen. From Aamir Khan&rsquo;s Ghajini, Katrina Kaif&rsquo;s Merry Christmas, Sidharth Malhotra&rsquo;s Hasee Toh Phasee, to many more, we have seen this actor shine with his acting skills. He is none other than Tinnu Anand.</p>

<p>Tinnu Anand&rsquo;s father, Inder Raj Anand, was a well-known writer in&nbsp;Bollywood. Despite his&nbsp;being a part of the glamor world, he did not want his son to enter the industry. But, the creative streak in him forced the veteran actor to go to his dad and confront him about his desire to direct a film.</p>

<p>Tinnu revealed that this had upset his father. But when he saw that his son did not want to do anything else, Anand was sent to the Satyajit Ray School.</p>

<p>In an interview, the Ghajini actor revealed how he was offered K Abass&rsquo; film Saat Hindustani. The heroine of this film, Neena Singh, suggested&nbsp;Amitabh Bachchan&rsquo;s name for a role in the film. To this, Abbas had said that Big B will have to come to Mumbai for auditions at his own expense, and this is how he landed in the dream city. It was Tinnu who took him to the filmmaker&rsquo;s office and was given the &lsquo;dirty job&rsquo; of offering Big B Rs. 5000 for the entire film.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Anand even got in a spat with Madhuri Dixit over her costume, which made the actress walk out of Shanakht.</p>

<p>He is married to Shahnaz, daughter of veteran actor Agha. His wife, who is a writer and former editor of Star &amp; Style magazine, financially supported the family when the actor was initially struggling in the industry.</p>

She is not just celebrated for her impeccable performances but also for being bold&nbsp;enough to follow her heart. She turned&nbsp;heads at Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor&rsquo;s wedding for attending the event by flaunting her sindoor look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, you heard that right! <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/alia-bhatts-mother-in-law-neetu-kapoor-calls-her-cool-and-we-cannot-agree-more-find-out-why-1380576">Neetu Kapoor</a> and Rishi Kapoor tied the knot in 1980. Actress Rekha, who was unmarried at that time, attended the high-profile wedding of her close friend Neetu wearing a sindoor. She absolutely stole the spotlight and her look became the talk of the town.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, while speaking to Hindustan Times, Rekha clarified that she attended the wedding directly from a shoot and simply forgot to remove the sindoor. She added that she wasn&rsquo;t concerned about how people would react, as she believed the look suited her and carried it with confidence.</p>

<p>In Yasser Usman&rsquo;s unofficial biography, Rekha: The Untold Story, the much-discussed incident is vividly described. The author shared how Rekha attended the wedding in a white saree and bright red bindi. However, the highlight was the sindoor on her maang. Cameras shifted focus from the newlyweds, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/rishi-kapoor-was-furious-when-ranbir-didnt-follow-his-warning-against-a-film-reveals-ananth-mahadevan-he-was-like-that-1357309">Rishi Kapoor</a> and Neetu Singh, to Rekha&rsquo;s unexpected appearance. Her look became the talk of the town with guests questioning whether Rekha had secretly tied the knot.</p>

<p>As per a Cine Blitz report from the time, she congratulated the couple before confidently taking her place at the center of the garden, further fueling the mystery.</p>

<p>The actress later married industrialist Mukesh Agarwal. Tragically, their marriage was short-lived due to his untimely death. Despite being widowed, Rekha has continued to wear sindoor, turning it into a signature part of her look. Over the years, she has made several public appearances styled as a married woman, confidently embracing the sindoor on her forehead.</p>

The duo has been giving couple goals ever since they married, and fans are in love with them. However, did you know that Renuka married Ashutosh just to have kids. Yes, you read&nbsp;that right! Renuka recently spilled the beans on her wedding with the actor, and the backstory will definitely surprise you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a recent conversation with Gauahar Khan on her podcast show MaaNoranjan, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/dupahiya-sparsh-shrivastava-gajraj-rao-renuka-shahane-and-bhuvan-arora-announce-season-2s-return-with-a-quirky-video-watch-1379629">Renuka Shahane</a> opened up about it and shared that, although they were dating, it was quite difficult for them to take the big step of getting married. She shared that they both were flourishing in their careers and content in their independent lives, and leaping into marriage was a daunting prospect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the spotlight constantly on them, they were aware that any misstep, whether in the relationship or the institution of marriage, could be magnified. The pressure of making it work while balancing fame made the decision even more complex.</p>

<p>Renuka revealed her intention behind tying the knot, and it&rsquo;s about starting a family. She shared, &ldquo;But, I got married only because I wanted kids. I was very happy because my idea of having a stable family background for my kids was very clear in my head. Rana ji, being a very family-oriented person, you want the father of your child to be like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She also shared that they got married as Ashutosh&rsquo;s spiritual guru suggested. Revealing the same, Renuka shared, &ldquo;The only reason why Rana ji got married to me was because of his spiritual guru, he told him to. While we were dating, his guruji told him that I have chosen a bahu for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added, &ldquo;He was scared. Who is this person? He didn&rsquo;t know that guruji was talking about me only. Guruji said that she is a good girl, you should ask for her hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Renuka Shahane further shared that the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/top-opening-weekends-of-2025-akshay-kumars-housefull-5-secures-2nd-spot-as-chhaava-continues-to-rule-1390997">Chhaava</a> actor revealed to her mother his intention to marry her, as his spiritual guru had suggested. Her mom was taken aback and questioned whether Rana was proposing out of genuine love or simply because his guru had advised him to do so.</p>

<p>She also shared how her husband&rsquo;s friend came to meet her a day after she delivered her first child and asked her to shed weight. She shared, &ldquo;There are a lot of things that people don&rsquo;t tell you. It was so strange that a doctor, who was visiting us, happened to be a friend of Ashutosh. He and his wife came to visit me in the hospital, and the first thing he said was &lsquo;now you must lose weight&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actress revealed that she was&nbsp;taken aback by his unexpected comment immediately after she had given birth to her first child. Still adjusting to the whirlwind of new motherhood, she couldn&rsquo;t quite grasp what kind of pressure was being referred to. The remark left her completely bewildered, especially since she had just experienced the most significant moment of experiencing motherhood for the very first time.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Renuka Shahane and Ashutosh Rana tied the knot in 2001. The duo has been blessed with two sons, Shauryaman and Satyendra.</p>

She has never hesitated to speak&nbsp;her mind, and she is loved by many for this quality. Well, there was a time when the Aisha star, without any hesitation, talked about how she doesn&rsquo;t think that Shah Rukh Khan wanted to work with her. Anil Kapoor&rsquo;s daughter also confessed to reaching out to him for the same, but that did not work.</p>

<p>This 2016 interview never gets old. Talking to Filmfare, Sonam Kapoor was questioned about not working with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-reunites-with-shah-rukh-khan-on-king-filming-begins-on-may-20-1388022">Shah Rukh Khan</a>. To this, the actress casually replied that she doesn&rsquo;t think King Khan wants to work with her. &ldquo;There have been so many opportunities&hellip; I wanted to work with him and reached out to him as well, but I never got the opportunity. I guess it will happen whenever he feels like working with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was yet another Bollywood Hungama interview, where a fan had asked her about why she had not worked with SRK in a film yet. The Kapoor lad replied, saying that she hasn&rsquo;t been offered even a single movie with him.</p>

<p>Adding on to it, she said, &ldquo;No body from Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s space has ever offered her a film. Maybe I&rsquo;m not the kind of actor he wants to work with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talking about her personal front, the Zoya Factor actor has been enjoying her married life with husband Anand Ahuja. These two are happily raising their son, Vayu, and the pictures are always dreamy.</p>

<p>Recently, she hosted her birthday bash in Mumbai, which was attended not only by her Kapoor Khaandaan but also by her close friends from the industry. The list includes Kareena Kapoor Khan-Saif Ali Khan, Swara Bhasker, Masaba Gupta, Vedang Raina, Pernia Qureshi, Bhumi Pednekar, and many other people.</p>

<p>Sonam has taken it slow in terms of her professional front after the birth of her son, Vayu. She does not have any officially announced films yet. But, reportedly, the actress will be a part of Battle for Bittora.</p>

<p>In a shocking loss for the film industry,&nbsp;filmmaker Partho Ghosh passed away on June 9. Known for directing various iconic films in Indian cinema, the veteran filmmaker breathed his last at the age of 75. The cause of death is known to be&nbsp;a heart attack that he suffered on Monday morning. Partho lived in Madh Island, Mumbai, and is survived by his wife, Gouri Ghosh. According to India Today, actress Rituparna Sengupta confirmed the news of his demise.</p>

<p>Born in Kolkata on June 8, 1949, Partho&#39;s childhood was marked by a deep passion for literature, art, and music. His love for art and cinema led him to the film industry, and in 1985, Partho Ghosh began his journey as an assistant director in Bengali movies.</p>

<p>After working for years, he gained much recognition owing to his hard work and talent. Following his transition to Hindi cinema, 100 Days emerged as a breakthrough in his career. Starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/madhuri-dixit-swears-by-this-3-ingredient-diy-hair-mask-for-smooth-shiny-hair-1388787">Madhuri Dixit</a> and Jackie Shroff, the suspense thriller drama movie opened to positive reviews.</p>

<p>Although it was a remake of a Tamil film titled Noorvathu Naal, it was well received by the audience. After 100 Days, Partho Ghosh directed Geet. It is yet another Hindi movie that gained him recognition and became one of the stepping stones in his career. Featuring Divya Bharti and Avinash Wadhawan, it hit the big screens in 1992. However, he redefined excellence by directing Mithun Chakraborty starrer Dalaal, released in 1993.</p>

The filmmaker who also produced the Saif Ali Khan-led web show took a dig and claimed that Ted should have started with Saas Bahu, and he would have done well.</p>

<p>Kashyap further called the CEO &lsquo;dumb&rsquo; and stated that he always knew the tech guys are dumb when it comes to storytelling. He also called Sarandos the &lsquo;definition of dumb&rsquo;. &ldquo;Good to discover that. This explains everything now.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="68ca6a16b0d3a"><strong>What was Ted Sarandos&rsquo; comment on Sacred Games?</strong></h2>

<p>On Nikhil Kamath&rsquo;s podcast, Ted Sarandos spoke about Netflix&rsquo;s slower-than-expected growth in India. He talked about their first Indian original show being Sacred Games, which was a TV show that felt as big as a movie and featured movie stars.</p>

<p>Having said this, the Netflix CEO admitted that he would have taken a different approach if he had to do it all over again. Sandos confessed that he would have done things that were more populist instead of Sacred Games. This was the beginning of Kashyap Vs Sandos.</p>

Actor breaks silence]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/433325076_aamir-breaks-silence-on-age-gap-with-genelia.jpg"></img><p>Aamir Khan is all geared up for the release of his upcoming movie Sitaare Zameen Par. Almost 17 years back, Genelia Deshmukh, who acted with Khan&#39;s nephew Imran Khan in Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, is making her comeback with Taare Zameen Par&#39;s spiritual sequel. She has been cast as the 60-year-old actor&#39;s wife in the film, and naturally, the discussion about their age gap has taken over everyone&#39;s minds. Now, Mr. Perfectionist opened up about it and said that &#39;age is no longer a barrier for actors&#39;.</p>

<p>Talking to the Indian Express, Aamir Khan was questioned about the unusual pairing with Genelia Deshmukh in Sitaare Zameen Par. The actor quite confidently shut even a single bar of doubt in everyone&#39;s minds by admitting that this thought had come to his mind as well.</p>

<p>Having said this, he also confessed that it was a long time ago when he cast the actress opposite his nephew, Imran Khan. He jokingly said, &quot;Ab Imran bhi kaafi meri age ka ho gaya hai.&quot; (Now even Imran has become quite his age).</p>

<p>Aamir further added that they now have the advantage of VFx. Explaining this further, the PK star said that earlier, if he had to play an 18-year-old, he would have to rely on prosthetics. He even cited an example from Anil Kapoor&#39;s 1989 film Eeshwar.</p>

<p>&quot;Today, you can look 80 or 40 or 20 on screen with seamless visual effects. So age is no longer a barrier for actors,&quot; concluded the actor.</p>

<p>Recently, the Sarfarosh star revealed that his 90-year-old mother will be making her acting debut in Sitaare Zameen Par. He was shocked when his mother agreed to it. Aamir Khan revealed how his mother decided to visit the sets one day during a fun wedding shoot. It was then that the director R.S. Prasanna approached him with a heartfelt request.</p>

<p>He urged him to ask if his mother could be a guest in the scene, since it was the last song and a celebration moment. He was initially hesitant, unsure if his mother would agree, given her strong-willed nature. However, when he gently approached her, to his surprise, she agreed. She ended up being part of a few shots in the wedding sequence, making it a truly special memory for Aamir. He added, &quot;It&#39;s the only film of mine that she has ever been a part of.&quot;</p>

<p>Sitaare Zameen Par will hit the theaters on June 20, 2025, and it stars 10 neurodivergent actors.</p>

The film, starring Mahesh Babu and Priyanka Chopra in the lead roles, is currently under production and is expected to be one of the biggest Indian films to date.</p>

<p>According to reports, Madhavan will play a powerful and key character in the film, though the makers have not officially confirmed his casting yet, as per MoneyControl. His inclusion has already created a buzz among fans, adding more star power to the already impressive cast that includes Malayalam actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prithviraj-sukumaran-faces-legal-notice-from-it-department-over-film-remuneration-report-1380879">Prithviraj Sukumaran</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What role will R Madhavan play in SSMB29?</strong></p>

<p>While the exact details of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-looking-back-at-r-madhavans-major-theatrical-successes-as-he-gears-up-for-kesari-2s-release-1382685">R Madhavan&#39;s</a> character have been kept under wraps, sources say it will be pivotal to the film&rsquo;s storyline. The project marks the first collaboration between Madhavan and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ss-rajamouli-decides-to-put-an-end-to-two-part-format-of-storytelling-with-mahesh-babus-next-reason-revealed-1380532">SS Rajamouli</a>, who is known for directing blockbuster films like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-with-baahubali-re-release-announcement-heres-revisiting-earlier-re-run-of-prabhas-salaar-1385099">Baahubali</a> and RRR.</p>

<p>The film is currently being shot in multiple international locations, with a blend of Indian mythological themes and global adventure elements. Rajamouli is reportedly drawing inspiration from Wilbur Smith&rsquo;s novels and the legend of Lord Hanuman for this film.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s what we know so far about SSMB29</strong></p>

<p>SSMB29 began filming in January 2025. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ssmb29-mahesh-babu-starrer-to-feature-a-colossal-action-sequence-involving-over-3000-people-heres-what-we-know-1383366">Mahesh Babu</a> and Priyanka Chopra have already shot several scenes in Hyderabad and Odisha. Major action sequences have been completed, and more global locations are scheduled for upcoming shoots.</p>

<p>The production team is also building elaborate sets in Hyderabad to recreate parts of Kashi, as the story is partly set in the holy city. The film is being produced by veteran filmmaker KL Narayana with an estimated budget of Rs 1,000 crores. It is being written by Rajamouli&rsquo;s father, the noted screenwriter Vijayendra Prasad.</p>

<p>The makers have not yet announced the full plot, but the film promises to deliver a mix of mythology, adventure, and grand visuals. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ssmb29-mahesh-babu-and-ss-rajamouli-to-kick-off-new-schedule-on-june-9-in-hyderabad-1390630">SSMB29</a> is expected to be released in theatres worldwide in 2027.</p>

This worked out to Rs 4.35 crore per minute, the highest per-minute rate ever recorded for an Indian actor.</p>

<p>At a time when top stars like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-raghav-juyal-and-saurabh-shukla-join-shah-rukh-khan-on-siddharth-anands-king-1389248">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Salman Khan, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/i-am-having-a-whirlwind-affair-with-when-prabhas-revealed-why-he-has-not-been-able-to-find-his-dream-girl-1377788">Prabhas</a>, and Vijay command massive fees, this short role by Ajay set a new benchmark. To put it in perspective, if Shah Rukh Khan were to charge the same rate for Jawan, where he appears for about 70 minutes, his fee would have been over Rs 300 crore, more than the film&rsquo;s total budget.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s how Ajay&rsquo;s RRR cameo changed industry pay scales</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ss-rajamouli-decides-to-put-an-end-to-two-part-format-of-storytelling-with-mahesh-babus-next-reason-revealed-1380532">SS Rajamouli</a> announced <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/rrr-movie-review-ss-rajamouli-creates-revolution-roaring-action-riveting-drama-1053196">RRR</a> in 2017 after the success of Baahubali 2. Jr NTR and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/watch-ram-charan-flaunts-his-rugged-long-hair-look-as-he-returns-to-hyderabad-after-vacation-1390359">Ram Charan</a> were the lead stars, with Alia Bhatt and Shriya Saran later joining. In early 2019, Ajay Devgn came on board for a powerful cameo. Though his screen time was only eight minutes, he charged Rs 35 crore for the appearance.</p>

<p>At Rs 4.35 crore per minute, his fee outpaced all other actors in India as per the Hindustan Times. For comparison, stars like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanth-chiranjeevi-and-ntr-became-stars-with-bollywood-remakes-rgv-on-south-films-glory-1390786">Rajinikanth</a> (Jailer), Salman Khan (Tiger 3), Prabhas (Kalki 2898 AD), and Allu Arjun (Pushpa 2) would need to charge over Rs 250 crore to match that rate, which none of them have reportedly done. This short but high-fee role helped Ajay stand out as India&rsquo;s highest-paid actor by the per-minute metric.</p>

<p><strong>Ajay Devgn&rsquo;s evolving fee structure post 2019</strong></p>

<p>Ajay Devgn has continued to see box office success after the pandemic, with hits like Drishyam 2, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-raid-2-emerges-as-42nd-success-and-17th-hit-for-ajay-devgn-with-eyes-now-on-de-de-pyaar-de-2-and-son-of-sardaar-2-1387483">Raid 2</a>, and Singham Again. His pay varies based on the project. He reportedly charged Rs 20 crore for smaller films such as Raid 2 and Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha, while commanding Rs 40 crore or more for big productions like Singham Again.</p>

<p>In 2021, he also became the highest-paid OTT actor in India, signing on for Rudra: The Edge of Darkness on Disney+ Hotstar for Rs 125 crore.</p>

<p>Chiranjeevi was the first Indian actor to charge Rs 1 crore for a film in the 1990s. That became the standard, with top actors like the Khans, Akshay Kumar, Sridevi, and Madhuri Dixit following suit. But with time, Rs 1 crore became standard even for supporting roles.</p>

While many find easy success, others struggle until they achieve a major breakthrough. Let&#39;s talk about one such actress, who was born and raised in Toronto but moved to India, hoping to pursue a career in acting. She was one of the contestants of Bigg Boss, shared screen space with superstars like Prabhas and Ajay Devgn, and survived on an egg during her struggle days. She is none other than Nora Fatehi.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Canada, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/nora-fatehi-is-too-hot-to-handle-in-tom-ford-leopard-print-gown-bedazzled-with-sequins-1389676">Nora Fatehi</a> landed her acting debut with the Hindi movie Roar: Tigers of the Sundarbans. She then ventured into the South film industry and starred in several Telugu and Malayalam projects. Meanwhile, the 33-year-old also made a special appearance in Vikram Bhatt&#39;s directorial, Mr X, led by Emraan Hashmi.</p>

<p>Owing to the Manohari song from Baahubali: The Beginning, wherein she showed off her dancing skills, Nora gained recognition in the industry. In 2016, she went on to participate in the dance reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 9.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Nora left her fans impressed with her dance numbers, Kamariya, O Saki O Saki, and Dilbar. Taking up new opportunities, the Toronto-born actress signed the dotted lines of the dance film Street Dancer 3D. In addition to this, Nora played the role of a spy in Ajay Devgn starrer Bhuj: The Pride Of India. A few of her recent tracks are Manike, Jehda Nasha, Payal, and Sultana, among others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recalling her struggling days, Nora revealed that she had only Rs 5000 when she landed in Mumbai. &quot;I lived with nine psychopaths in a three BHK apartment where I shared a room with two other girls. During my stay there, I used to think, &#39;What have I got myself into?&#39; I am still traumatized,&quot; shared the actress. Highlighting how agencies would pay a meagre amount, she opened up about surviving on an egg and a bread.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the dance sensation turned witness in the Rs 215 crore extortion case involving conman Sukesh Chandrashekhar. Nora Fatehi claimed that he had promised her a big house and a lavish lifestyle if she agreed to be his girlfriend. The case is still under investigation.</p>

While the actor is on a promotional spree, he shared how sleepless nights and anxiety ahead of any film&#39;s release are good signs for him. In a recent interview with Galatta Plus, Aamir Khan mentioned that he cannot sleep before the release of any film and gets anxious as he is excited to show what he has made. Though the actor named one film of his entire career where he could sleep well, the reason will surprise you!</p>

<h2 id="68d5071fd4e7b"><strong>Aamir Khan recalls a conversation with Kiran Rao, underlining&nbsp;&#39;not liking&#39; Thugs Of Hindostan</strong></h2>

<p>The Dangal actor mentioned that it was Thugs of Hindostan where he knew the movie would flop, as he himself didn&#39;t like it. While going down the memory lane, Aamir recalled his chat with ex-wife Kiran Rao and said, &quot;Kiran asked me two weeks before the release of Thugs of Hindostan, she said, &#39;You&#39;re sleeping very calmly this time, what happened?&#39; I said because I&#39;m not happy with the film, and I also don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to do well.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Perfectionist went on to add that he was clear in his head that the movie had not shaped well, so there was no anxiety. &quot;Anxiety is when you&#39;re excited about showing what you&#39;ve made and you think it&#39;s good and you&#39;re hoping people will like it&mdash;but you don&#39;t know how people are going to react,&quot; added the actor. Aamir Khan concluded his thoughts by mentioning that there will be no anxiety if there is no excitement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only this, Jamie recalled yet another bad experience during her school days when a bus conductor used to touch her and her friends. She termed it a &lsquo;bad dream&rsquo;. &ldquo;He was supposed to be our protector, but instead, he would touch us and hold us. For me, all these incidents are like a bad dream. I don&rsquo;t want to revisit these incidents,&rdquo; she said.</p>

The film, also starring Genelia Deshmukh, is being labelled as Aamir&rsquo;s comeback&nbsp;film after Laal Singh Chaddha. However, it didn&rsquo;t sit well with the superstar and he refused the &lsquo;comeback&rsquo; tag very gently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an interview with News 18, Aamir Khan reacted to Sitaare Zameen Par being called his &lsquo;comeback&rsquo; film and shared, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not considering it a comeback film, quite honestly. My films usually come out once in three years anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added, &ldquo;A lot of actors have 8 to 10 flops, but we don&rsquo;t call those comebacks, do we? I&rsquo;ve had just one flop, and you&rsquo;re calling it a comeback? I haven&rsquo;t gone anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the same interview, the actor&nbsp;shared that he was deeply moved by the script of Sitaare Zameen Par, which he felt naturally carried forward the spirit of Taare Zameen Par. While his 2007 film focused on a child with a learning disability and the importance of inclusion, the new story takes things further by highlighting the lives of children with intellectual disabilities such as autism and Down&nbsp;syndrome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actor also revealed that the emotional shift in the narrative is the most beautiful thing about the film. This time, it&rsquo;s the neurodivergent children who guide and support the coach, flipping the dynamic seen in his earlier film. According to him, it made the film even more powerful and meaningful.</p>

<p>Aamir Khan further shared that the story struck a personal chord with him and felt like a natural spiritual follow-up to Taare Zameen Par. That deep connection is what inspired the makers to name the film Sitaare Zameen Par.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Sitaare Zameen Par is the spiritual successor to Aamir&rsquo;s 2007 film Taare Zameen Par. The sports comedy is directed by R. S. Prasanna, and produced by Aamir Khan, Aparna Purohit, and Ravi Bhagchandka. It also stars Genelia Deshmukh, apart from Aamir.</p>

The video can see Atlee narrating the story of AA22 x A6 to Deepika Padukone who looks classy in an all-white comfy attire. With whatever little we have seen in this video, one thing is very clear that the actress will be seen in a never-seen-before avatar and we cannot be more excited about it.</p>

<p>This is the first time she will be collaborating with Allu Arjun. While she has already worked with Atlee in Jawan for a cameo she made opposite Shah Rukh Khan, seeing them come together for a full-fledged film is going to be something else.</p>

<p>Well, this announcement has come just days after a big fallout between her and Sandeep Reddy Vanga&rsquo;s Spirit. The actress had earlier joined hands with the Animal director for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-deepika-padukone-joins-prabhas-in-sandeep-reddy-vangas-spirit-1385537">Prabhas </a>starrer magnum opus.

<p>Apart from the Atlee directorial, Deepika will reportedly be seen in Shah Rukh Khan starrer King. This film also stars Suhana Khan in a pivotal role.</p>

It features a star-studded ensemble and has been making headlines even before its release. The latest actor to be roped in the war drama is Vivek Oberoi. Now, Arun Govil took a subtle dig at Ranbir for playing the role of Lord Ram.</p>

<p>Arun Govil rose to fame with Ramanand Sagar&rsquo;s Ramayan where he played the role of Lord Ram. However, in Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s mythological drama, he will be seen in the role of King Dashrath. In a recent interview with NDTV, Arun Govil said, &ldquo;Three-four people tried recreating it, but they were not successful. I don&rsquo;t think in our lifetime someone should try to recreate Ramayan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking a subtle dig at Ranbir Kapoor, the actor shared, &ldquo;As far as some actor playing Ram (is concerned), all the available actors, all the stars at this moment &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think anyone is suitable. Maybe you can find someone outside the industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earlier, while speaking to Hindustan Times, Sunil Lahri expressed his disappointment over Arun Govil portraying Dashrath in the upcoming film. He felt that by taking on this role, he was&nbsp;diminishing the iconic image he had built as Lord Ram. Sunil added that if he were offered a similar role, he would have declined it. Referring to Arun as an elder brother, he mentioned that out of respect, he wouldn&rsquo;t have accepted any other part either.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, apart from Ranbir Kapoor and Arun Govil, Ramayana also stars KGF star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/exclusive-yash-reaches-mumbai-ahead-of-toxics-next-schedule-for-march-last-week-kiara-advani-to-also-join-1378983">Yash</a> as Ravana, Sai Pallavi as Goddess Sita, Sunny Deol as Lord Hanuman, Lara Dutta as Kaykay, Rakul Preet Singh as Surpanakha and Vivek Oberoi as Vidyutjihva. Apart from them, the film also stars Ravi Dubey, Indira Krishnan, Amitabh Bachchan, Kunal Kapoor, Kajal Aggarwal, and others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ramayana will be released in two parts in the theater. The first part is locked to hit the theaters in Diwali 2026. Meanwhile, Part Two will be released on Diwali 2027. Both parts are being filmed simultaneously, in one go, and are in production currently.</p>

<p>Housefull 5 is among the biggest releases of 2025. Directed by Tarun Mansukhani, the cruise comedy stars the OGs Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh, alongside a huge ensemble cast. The movie also features Abhishek Bachchan, Nana Patekar, Fardeen Khan, Jackie Shroff, Jacqueline Fernandez, and more. Released on June 6, 2025, Housefull 5 has opened to mixed reviews.</p>

<p>There&#39;s much curiosity about the story as the film has two versions: Housefull 5A and Housefull 5B. This explanation post will help you understand everything that happened in the latter version.</p>

<p><strong>Housefull 5B Story</strong></p>

<p>The second version of Housefull 5 shows Ranjeet Dobriyal, a billionaire who owns assets worth 69 billion pounds. Just a day before celebrating his 100th birth anniversary, he dies a natural death. His stepson Dev (played by Fardeen Khan) plans to hide Ranjeet&#39;s death, letting the celebration go on. Meanwhile, a hologram of Ranjeet appears, only to bring more chaos and drama.</p>

<p>Talking about the heir to his empire and wealth, he mentions that his first son (Jolly) from his first wife will be given all his money and empire. This marks the beginning of the &#39;Jolly&#39; game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riteish Deshmukh as Jalabuddin (Jolly 1), <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/housefull-5-trailer-launch-7-moments-that-were-pure-crazy-from-akshay-kumars-savage-reply-on-his-fees-to-abhishek-bachchan-dodging-accident-1389652">Abhishek Bachchan</a> as Jalbhushan (Jolly 2), and Akshay Kumar as Julius (Jolly 3) leave no stones unturned to prove themselves as the real Jolly. So, to simplify the situation, Dev comes up with a plan of a DNA test for three suspected Jollys on a lavish cruise. Although the three are aware that they aren&#39;t Ranjeet&#39;s son, all of them are up for the test because of the huge money.</p>

<p><strong>Housefull 5B Ending Explained: Spoiler Alert</strong></p>

<p>After the DNAs are collected, a deck party kicks in. Aakhri Pasta (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/excited-for-varun-dhawan-pooja-hegdes-hai-jawani-to-ishq-hona-hai-heres-bts-pics-from-scotland-ft-chunky-panday-david-dhawans-reunion-and-more-1385086">Chunky Panday</a>) spikes the drink of&nbsp;Batuk Patel (Johnny Lever), but Jollys end up consuming it. Hence, when they wake up the next morning, they&nbsp;have no memory of the previous night.</p>

<p>During the same night, Maya of Ranjeet&#39;s team (played by Chitrangda) tried to alter the DNA of the three Jollys as she desperately wanted the money. But the doctor, Amar Joshi, caught her red-handed. So, to avoid him from telling the truth, she stuffed peanut butter biscuits into the doctor&#39;s mouth, as the latter was revealed to be allergic to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Jolly 3 (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/housefull-5-day-1-box-office-trends-akshay-kumar-and-team-set-for-rs-20-crore-plus-opening-1390785">Akshay Kumar</a>) arrived at the scene and used an injection to save the doctor. But Maya stabbed the doctor and killed him after Jolly 3 went away. But there&#39;s a twist! The captain of the ship, Sameer (played by Nikitin Dheer), saw Maya killing the doctor.</p>

<p>The murder puts&nbsp;the Jollys and their respective partners under suspicion. Besides them, Dev and other members of Ranjeet&#39;s team also end up becoming the prime suspects. After the doctor is killed, police officers Bhidu (Sanjay Dutt) and Baba (Jackie Shroff) arrive on the cruise to carry out the investigation. Talking about Sameer, who is also one of the suspects, could not reveal the truth to others. He wants his name to get cleared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the story progresses, Maya teams up with Jolly 2 to kill Captain Sameer. Lastly, Maya is revealed as the killer. She wanted money to pay off her debts.</p>

<p>Bankrolled by Sajid Nadidwala, Housefull 5 hit the big screen on June 6, 2025. The movie features an ensemble cast and stars Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, Abhishek Bachchan, Nana Patekar, Fardeen Khan, Jackie Shroff, Jacqueline Fernandez, Nargis Fakhri, Sonam Bajwa, and others. According to reports, it is the most expensive comedy films ever made in Indian cinema.</p>

<p>As the comedy caper is receiving mixed reviews, let us delve into the story and the climax. Since Housefull 5 has been released in two versions, Housefull 5A and Housefull 5B, this explanation post will help you understand everything that happened in the former version.</p>

<p><strong>Housefull 5A Story</strong></p>

<p>The A version of Housefull 5 follows Ranjeet Dobriyal, a billionaire worth 69 billion pounds. Interestingly, he dies a natural death a day before celebrating his 100th birthday, and this is when the chaos begins. However, his stepson, Dev (played by Fardeen Khan), hides the tragic incident as he wants the party to go on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While things seem to be proceeding normally, a hologram of Ranjeet brings a new twist to the story. Revealing who actually would be the heir to his empire and wealth, it mentions that his fortune will go to his first son (Jolly) from his first wife. And that&#39;s when the &#39;Jolly&#39; game kicks in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riteish Deshmukh as Jalabuddin (Jolly 1), Abhishek Bachchan as Jalbhushan (Jolly 2), and Akshay Kumar as Julius (Jolly 3) are desperate to prove&nbsp;themselves as the real Jolly to take ownership of Ranjeet&#39;s wealth. So, Dev plans a DNA test for three suspected Jollys on a lavish cruise. Although the three are aware that they aren&#39;t Ranjeet&#39;s son, all of them participate in the game for the money.</p>

<p><strong>Housefull 5A Ending Explained: Spoiler Alert</strong></p>

<p>As the story progresses, Aakhri Pasta (Chunky Panday) spikes the drink of Batuk Patel (Johnny Lever), but ultimately, the Jollys end up consuming it during the deck party. This is why they wake up with no memory of the previous night.</p>

<p>It is in the night that Dev tries to alter the DNA of the three Jollys as he wanted all of Ranjeet&#39;s wealth and didn&#39;t want the 3 Jollys&nbsp;to&nbsp;have&nbsp;it. But the doctor catches him doing so. To avoid being exposed, Dev stuffs peanut butter biscuits into the doctor&#39;s mouth, as the latter is allergic to it. However, Jolly 3 (Akshay Kumar) saves the doctor&#39;s life using an injection. When Jolly 3 leaves the scene, Dev stabs the doctor and kills him, but Sameer (played by Nikitin Dheer), the captain of the ship, sees Dev doing so.</p>

<p>The Jollys and their partners (Sonam Bajwa, Jacqueline Fernandes, Nargis Fakhri) become prime suspects. Even Ranjeet&rsquo;s team, consisting of Maya (Chitrangada Singh), Bedi (Dino Morea), Shiraz (Shreyas Talpade), Lucy (Soundarya Sharma), Batuk Patel (Johnny Lever), and others, are also under suspicion. Expelled London cops Bhidu (Sanjay Dutt) and Baba (Jackie Shroff) arrive on the cruise for investigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among them is Sameer (Nikitin Dheer), who is also one of the suspects in the murder case, and hence was concerned about clearing his image. This is the reason that he couldn&#39;t tell the truth to everyone.</p>

<p>Lastly, Dev teams up with Jolly 2&nbsp;to kill Captain Sameer. This reveals Dev as the murderer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the actress had a roka ceremony with Ashish&nbsp;a few months back. She dropped photos from the same and looked no&nbsp;less than a fairy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, in an interview with ETimes, Shazahn Padamsee opened up on taking up a big step in her life and praised her husband&rsquo;s family for being &lsquo;warm and welcoming&rsquo;.</p>

<p>She said, &ldquo;Ashish&#39;s family has been so warm and welcoming that it&#39;s difficult to believe we&#39;ve known each other for just two years. It was such a special day. The one person I miss the most is my dad. I wish he had been there by my side, sharing the moment with me. He would have been so happy and proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shazahn&nbsp;was introduced to Ashish Kanakia, son of Rupal and Rasesh Kanakia, by a longtime childhood friend who played cupid. While they clicked instantly, Shazahn chose to take things slow. The two spent several months meeting over dinners, gradually building a connection that blossomed into love. Though their upbringings were different, a shared set of values brought them closer.</p>

From playing endearing characters to picking up serious roles in films, the actress has proved her finesse and versatility. In a recent interaction with a media portal, she shared a hilarious anecdote from her early days of acting. Vidya recalled rejecting a film that featured her opposite Akshaye Khanna and revealed how the latter reacted to her saying &#39;no&#39; to the project.</p>

<p>Revisiting her journey and years-long career in the industry, the Do Aur Do Pyaar actress mentioned how she never wanted to hurt anyone by saying &#39;no&#39; to any project. Vidya Balan shared, &quot;There was a film offered to me opposite Akshaye Khanna, and for some reason, I didn&rsquo;t connect with the script. But I didn&#39;t pick up the phone and tell him that. I asked my manager to convey it to the director.&quot;</p>

<p>The 46-year-old went on to share that when she met Akshaye on the sets of Salaam-e-Ishq, he fired her for rejecting the script, after which she ran to John Abraham for help. She asked to save her and opened up about not wanting to indulge in confrontation, hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, or make someone feel bad. &quot;But eventually, he was only pulling my leg. I later realized,&quot; added Vidya.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Tumhari Sulu actress agreed to the fact that no one wants to hear &#39;no,&#39; given that so much effort and time are invested into creating a script. Making a heartfelt confession, Balan stated that being married to a producer has made her realize the same even more than before. Spilling beans on the way to becoming honest, Vidya told the portal, &quot;I&#39;m not a rude person. I say it as it is, but &nbsp;I am aware of how much efforts go into developing a script and I value it.&quot;</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Vidya Balan was last seen in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bhool-bhulaiyaa-3-final-box-office-collections-worldwide-kartik-aaryans-horror-comedy-wraps-theatrical-run-at-solid-rs-371-crore-bagging-superhit-verdict-1361049">Bhool Bhulaiyya 3</a> alongside Madhuri Dixit and Kartik Aaryan.

The Hindi film industry has witnessed many actors refining their mettle over the years. While a few keep working, some adapt a different approach and wait for a strong project to be offered. And the same is the case with a budding actor, who&#39;s the son of a popular Bollywood figure. Can you guess it? We are talking about Ahan Shetty.</p>

<p>Ahan was born on December 28, 1995, to Suniel and Mana Shetty. He has an elder sister, Athiya, who has now quit showbiz and is living away from the spotlight. Going by his social media handle, the 29-year-old seems to be a huge sports enthusiast. From football to shooting and tennis, he has never shied away from channeling his inner sportsman. Not only this, but the rookie actor maintains a sculpted physique by hitting the gym. One can notice several snaps from his gym and workout sessions on his social media.</p>

<p>Coming to his career, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/in-pics-ahan-shetty-takes-on-mamu-duty-as-he-lovingly-cradles-athiya-shetty-kl-rahuls-newborn-evaarah-1390424">Ahan Shetty</a> marked his debut with the romantic action drama film Tadap (2021). Directed by Milan Lutharia, the movie featured Tara Sutaria as the female lead. Touted to be a remake of a hit Telugu film, RX 100. Unfortunately, it couldn&rsquo;t do wonders at the box office, and Tadap flopped drastically. Since then, Ahan hasn&rsquo;t signed any project, but now, he&rsquo;s betting big on one of the most anticipated movies, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-diljit-dosanjh-to-start-border-2-with-sunny-deol-in-june-film-wrap-in-august-1389915">Border 2.</a></p>

<p>Yes, you read that right! The Tadap actor will be seen sharing screens with Sunny Deol in the sequel to Border. Helmed by Anurag Singh, the upcoming installment also stars Varun Dhawan and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/diljit-dosanjhs-exit-from-no-entry-2-confirmed-anees-bazmee-reveals-shocking-details-1390443">Diljit Dosanjh</a>. Border 2 is scheduled to release in cinemas next year during the Republic Day weekend.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ahan was set to star alongside Pooja Hegde in a movie titled Sanki, backed by Sajid Nadiadwala. However, according to the reports, the project has been put on the back burner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, as of now, the young actor has taken up &lsquo;mama&rsquo; duties as Athiya welcomed a baby girl with her husband, KL Rahul.</p>

<p>Aamir Khan will also make a special appearance in Lokesh Kanagaraj&rsquo;s Coolie, which has already been shot. Slated to release on August 14, Coolie starring Rajinikanth, will have a massy cameo of Khan as the director has designed a special character for him that will be a treat for the fans. The movie also stars Nagarjuna, Upendra, Soubin Shahir, and Shruti Haasan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Coolie is all set to clash with War 2, starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR&nbsp;on Independence Day 2025 weekend. The makers are planning to opt for an 8-week OTT window in order to have&nbsp;a wide release in the Hindi belt.&nbsp;</p>

The duo made waves with their fiery chemistry. However, did you know that Aaman wasn&rsquo;t the first choice for the&nbsp;role?&nbsp;Instead, Siddharth Nigam, known for Hai Junoon, was the first preference. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, things didn&rsquo;t go well after the entire script was narrated to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a recent conversation with Instant Bollywood, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/mumbai-bula-ke-bech-diya-to-aamir-khans-dhoom-3-child-actor-siddharth-nigam-reveals-why-he-was-scared-to-debut-in-yrf-actioner-1388243">Siddharth Nigam</a>&rsquo;s mother shed light on the casting and revealed, &ldquo;I took him along for the meeting. The entire script was narrated, and we waited for a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She revealed that she was quite happy with the film as it would have been a &lsquo;strong launch&rsquo; for Siddharth Nigam.

Then we saw that the film starred Ajay Devgn&rsquo;s nephew and Rasha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hai Junoon actor&rsquo;s mom revealed feeling bad for the first time in her life and added that both Aaman and Rasha are star kids and &lsquo;that made all the difference&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Siddharth Nigam chimed in adding that that there&rsquo;s no use of blaming anyone, as such decisions are part and parcel of the film industry. He shared that while it was &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo;, it brought a sense of clarity. After holding onto hope for nearly a year, seeing the teaser was the moment of acceptance for him, a quiet realization that it was time to let go and move forward.</p>

The star-studded cast has all the attention of the fans. The shooting of the film began just a few days ago. Earlier, Pinkvilla exclusively reported that Raghav Juyal has been cast for a key role. According to a report, the actor sustained an injury on the set. However, he didn&#39;t pause the shoot and was working in so much pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, you heard that right! As per a report in Bollywood Hungama, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-raghav-juyal-and-saurabh-shukla-join-shah-rukh-khan-on-siddharth-anands-king-1389248">Raghav Juyal</a> sustained a leg injury while shooting an action scene for King. The incident occurred during a particularly demanding stunt that saw the Kill actor push his physical limits.</p>

<p>The report also stated that Raghav got injured in the same leg in which he had previously undergone knee surgery. Soon after, an on-call medical team rushed in to treat the actor. A source told the portal, &quot;He was in considerable pain. The doctors have prescribed a heavy dosage of medication to manage it.&quot;</p>

<p>However, despite the injury, the actor showed much determination and refused to pause the shoot. The source told the portal, &quot;Raghav&#39;s resilience is remarkable. Having had knee surgery in the past, most actors would have stepped back. But not him &mdash; whether it was Kill or now King, he&#39;s constantly pushing boundaries.&quot;</p>

<p>They conducted raids at several restaurants, including Virat&rsquo;s One8 Commune, after getting a tip and found the restaurant lacking a smoking area. The report stated that they booked the staff and management under Sections 4 and 21 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) for failing to provide a separate smoking zone.</p>

<p>In fact, the restaurant had also landed in legal trouble back in 2024. The case was registered by the same police station for staying open beyond the hours permitted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As IPL 2025 is nearing, fans couldn&rsquo;t contain their excitement. There&rsquo;s another reason to be excited about this match, too.

Taare Zameen Par to stream free on YouTube but here's the catch]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/820884970_aamir.jpg"></img><p>Bollywood actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-aamir-khan-brainstorms-10-scripts-before-closing-a-deal-with-rajkumar-hirani-pk-2-also-in-the-discussion-1390527">Aamir Khan</a> is gearing up for the sequel of the hit film Taare Zameen Par, titled Sitaare Zameen Par. The film is all set to hit the theaters on June 20, 2025. Ahead of its release, the actor drops a surprise, and fans can&rsquo;t keep calm. He confirmed that Taare Zameen Par will be available to stream for free on YouTube. But there&rsquo;s a catch. He added that it will only be available for a week or two.</p>

<p>Yes, you heard that right! According to Bollywood Hungama, at the&nbsp;Taare Zameen Par Fan Meetup, the host talked about a boat scene from the film and asked Aamir Khan if the photograph in the room is of his mom and dad. The actor refuted it, saying he doesn&rsquo;t know whose parents are in the pic, and it might be Amole Gupte&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The host then added that he wanted to show the scene, but since the 2007 classic isn&rsquo;t available on any streaming platform, he couldn&rsquo;t. Hearing this, Aamir admitted that it&rsquo;s not available to watch online and dropped a big surprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He shared, &ldquo;Ek kaam karte hai, I have started a YouTube channel called Aamir Khan Talkies. I&rsquo;ll tell my team that let&rsquo;s upload Taare Zameen Par there free of cost.&rdquo; The actor further added that, &ldquo;It can be available for 1-2 weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aamir Khan also praised his co-star, Darsheel, during the event, as per the portal. He shared that when he used to explain the scene, the little boy used to dance all the time. However, the actor wasn&rsquo;t affected as he knew Darsheel was fully absorbing everything. He added that the moment they called for a take, he would immediately switch to his character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aamir Khan&rsquo;s upcoming film,&nbsp;Sitaare Zameen Par, is a sports comedy-drama film and is set to hit theaters on June 20, 2025. Apart from Aamir Khan, it also features Genelia Deshmukh, Dolly Ahluwalia, Aroush Datta, Gopi Krishna Varma, Samvit Desai, Vedant Sharma, Ayush Bhansali, Ashish Pendse, Rishi Shahani, Rishabh Jain, Naman Mishra, and Simran Mangeshkar.

From working with 90s directors to working with his children, he has done it all. He is also quite open about his thoughts and doesn&rsquo;t shy away from speaking his heart out. Recently, he opened up about working with his children, Zoya Akhtar and Farhan Akhtar. He also called Zoya a &lsquo;tough taskmaster&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with The Lallantop, Javed Akhtar opened up on working with his children and said, &ldquo;Kaam karna apne bachho ke liye bada mushkil hai.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further added, &ldquo;Dusro ke liye kaam karna asaan hai, apne bachho ke liye bada mushkil hain. Unko aisa nahi hai ki hamara baap hain toh hum kuch kahe nahin. Humein toh kuch kehna hi hain. Zoya tough taskmaster hai.&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s easier to work for others; working for your own children is very difficult. They don&rsquo;t think, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s our father, so we won&rsquo;t say anything.&rsquo; In fact, they feel they must say something. Zoya is a tough taskmaster).</p>

<p>Although both <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/dabba-cartel-exclusive-shabana-azmi-on-zoya-akhtars-dislike-for-female-director-tag-i-have-had-many-arguments-1375568">Zoya Akhtar</a> and Farhan Akhtar have made their mark as filmmakers, they gravitate toward very different genres. Reflecting on this, veteran screenwriter Javed Akhtar praised them as smart storytellers and noted that their filmmaking styles are distinctly unique. He added that while both are successful in their own right, neither could make a film quite like the other.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Zoya Akhtar is known for some hit films like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Dil Dhadakne Do, and Gully Boy. Meanwhile, Farhan Akhtar is both an actor and a director. He has played pivotal roles in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Dil Dhadakne Do, Rock On!! and more. Making a directorial debut with Dil Chahta Hai, he is gearing up for his next directorial,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kriti-sanon-frontrunner-for-don-3-with-ranveer-singh-farhan-akhtar-gears-up-for-third-chapter-1383778">Don 3</a>, starring Ranveer Singh in the lead role.

Some actors who step away from the limelight due to failure in making a successful career, but some personalities willingly quit acting. Meet an actor who was born to a popular Bollywood star, debuted with a Salman Khan production venture, and left showbiz after getting married to a successful cricketer. Well, we are talking about Athiya Shetty!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Born to popular Bollywood actor Suniel Shetty and Mana Shetty on November 5, 1992, Athiya Shetty is among the popular Starkids&nbsp;who tried to follow in their parents&rsquo; footsteps. Before entering the Bollywood film industry, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/skincare/athiya-shettys-skincare-routine-moisturizing-and-hydration-are-must-1389985">Athiya Shetty</a> completed her schooling at Cathedral and John Connon School and later shifted to the American School of Bombay. She studied acting at the New York Film Academy before starting her Bollywood career.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Athiya debuted in Bollywood with Hero (2016), starring opposite Sooraj Pancholi and produced by none other than Salman Khan. The movie was a remake of the 1983 blockbuster romantic action drama of the same name starring Jackie Shroff. Helmed by Nikkhil Advani, the Athiya Shetty starrer couldn&rsquo;t impress the audience much and failed to gain traction at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Post the debacle of her debut film, Athiya Shetty returned to the big screens with Mubarakaan, directed by Anees Bazmee. Though the clean family comedy met with favorable word-of-mouth, it also tanked at the box office. The actress also made a special appearance in Nawabzaade and won praise for the 2019 movie Motichoor Chaknachoor, starring alongside Nawazuddin Siddiqui. However, no film can do much for her acting career.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress got married to Indian cricketer KL Rahul in 2023, after dating him for a couple of years. The celebrated couple recently became parents to a newborn daughter named Evaarah. Athiya has now quit acting and is enjoying her motherhood. Confirming the same, father Suniel Shetty said in an interview that Athiya is in no mood to continue acting.&nbsp;</p>

Recently, the dancer&nbsp;opened up on how she copes with misleading narratives and the constant scrutiny she faced in the tough times. Further, Verma also explained whether she is open to giving love a second chance, months after her separation from Yuzvendra. So, here are some major revelations that Dhanashree made about her life.</p>

<p>1. Talking to Etimes, Dhanashree Verma got candid about how she dealt with narratives that didn&#39;t reflect the truth about her personal life crisis. &quot;None of it reflects who I am, and I don&#39;t engage with it because I know my values, my upbringing, and the kind of person I am&quot;, she said.</p>

<p>2. Revealing the values that have always kept her moving in life, the former Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 11&nbsp;contestant mentioned self-growth, self-love, and discipline. Dhanashree said that her belief lies in maintaining grace and dignity. The choreographer stressed how she believes that focusing on negativity hampers growth, and&nbsp;the same energy can be invested in making every day better.</p>

<p>3. She further added that dance has been her anchor as she coped with personal challenges. Crediting her work for helping her feel peaceful and positive, the choreographer&nbsp;remarked, &quot;There&#39;s hardly any time to sit still and I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way.&quot; The social media personality added that she has so much on her plate, whether creating music, working on songs or spending quality moments with her family.</p>

<p>4. In the same interview, Dhanashree reacted to whether she is open to giving love a second chance. She expressed that such aspects cannot be planned. &quot;You can&rsquo;t decide whether you&rsquo;ll fall in love today or a year from now. Love is an entirely different entity,&quot; added Verma. The choreographer asserted that keeping her career in focus matters most to her.</p>

<p>5. Calling herself a &#39;deeply spiritual person&#39;, Dhanashree told Etimes that the reason behind her being grounded is her faith in God and the universe. &nbsp;According to her, a person&#39;s success, values, and truth eventually matter.</p>

<p>For the unversed, rumors about Dhanashree and Yuzvendra&#39;s&nbsp;divorce surfaced after the couple unfollowed each other on social media. The two got hitched in December 2020 in an intimate ceremony in Gurugram, but in March 2025, they were officially granted a divorce.</p>

The Call Me Bae star often makes sure to be vocal about her feelings. Be it personal or professional life, fans are often excited to know about all the happenings in her life. The actress often makes headlines for her relationships, and now, in a recent interview, Ananya&nbsp;spoke about how she often &quot;changed herself&quot; in her previous relationships.</p>

<p>The CTRL actress confessed to overlooking red flags in a guy when she is deeply in love. The Pati Patni Aur Woh star&nbsp;further admitted that she changes herself a lot for the person she is with. Citing examples, Panday revealed that she starts watching the same films as the person she is with or starts dressing up like him and blamed her &lsquo;people-pleasing personality trait&rsquo; for this. &ldquo;It is not good,&rdquo; she stressed.</p>

<p>Having said this, AP&nbsp;also emphasized that people&nbsp;should be true to themselves in a relationship, and that their partner should accept them for who they are. Talking about red flags in a relationship, she named &lsquo;cheating, lying and disrespecting in public&rsquo; the biggest ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think someone who can&rsquo;t be happy for you when you are doing well is a big red flag, especially for successful women. I also feel bad for men because they are often put under this societal pressure that they need to be a certain way,&rdquo; said Ananya.</p>

<p>Talking about her work front, she was last seen in Kesari: Chapter 2 alongside <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-housefull-5-set-to-be-widest-akshay-kumar-release-of-all-time-to-arrive-on-5000-screens-in-india-1390438">Akshay Kumar</a> and R Madhavan.

It is reportedly being touted as a spiritual sequel of Taare Zameen Par.&nbsp;Khan&rsquo;s son, Junaid Khan, spoke&nbsp;about him being dyslexic in the past. But for the first time now, the actor has addressed&nbsp;how he dealt with his son&rsquo;s condition.</p>

<p>During a fan meet recently, Aamir Khan admitted that he is now comfortable discussing about Junaid Khan&rsquo;s dyslexia openly. The reason he connected deeply with Taare Zameen Par was because&nbsp;it mirrored his own experience.</p>

<p>Just like Ishaan Awasthi&rsquo;s dad in the movie, Aamir too did not understand Junaid&rsquo;s struggle with reading and writing. But when he discovered the condition, the actor supported him. The Laal Singh Chaddha star confessed that he did not speak about it out of respect for his son&rsquo;s privacy.</p>

<p>Recalling the time when he first heard the script, the 3 Idiots star&nbsp;revealed how&nbsp;it hit him hard as he went&nbsp;through it himself. &ldquo;I was like Nandkishore Awasthi in the beginning (the father from Taare Zameen Par). I used to scold Junaid.&quot;</p>

<p>Talking about the Loveyapa actor, Aamir revealed that as a child, his handwriting was really bad. He could not even write an A. While reading, he would say &lsquo;from&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;for&rsquo; whenever he saw an &lsquo;F&rsquo; word. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t read properly. So I used to try to explain things to him, and I would get confused too &mdash; how can he not understand such simple things? Then, later on, we found out he has dyslexia. And of course, we helped him with that. But when I heard the story, it felt like my story. It was so close to me,&rdquo; said the superstar.</p>

<p>On the work front, Aamir Khan is gearing up for the release of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-the-opening-day-collection-of-housefull-5-sitaare-zameen-par-maa-metro-in-dino-and-saiyaara-1390419">Sitaare Zameen Par</a>, which also stars Genelia Deshmukh in a pivotal role. After this, the actor would start working on his dream project, Mahabharat.</p>

The actress stepped out of Sandeep Reddy Vanga&rsquo;s Spirit after he refused to agree to her 8-hour shift demand. After Ajay Devgn and Mani Ratnam came in her support, Pankaj Tripathi has now spoken about practising the art of saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; on a set.</p>

<p>Talking to Anupama Chopra in The Hollywood Reporter interview, Pankaj Tripathi expressed that he always faces difficulty in saying &lsquo;No&rsquo;. But, the Stree 2 actor also said that he is practising this art now. Talking about extended hours on the set, the actor stated that every individual should know their boundary after which they should politely say &lsquo;no&rsquo;.</p>

<p>He opened up about days when his work hours kept extending. Pankaj Tripathi seemed annoyed when he spoke about the times his work hours stretched for 16 to 18 hours on set. &ldquo;Main bol bhi raha hu ki actor ja chuka hai labour ruka hua hai,&rdquo; quipped the Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl star.</p>

<p>Tripathi further stated that now he has decided to politely start refusing to stretch his hours by saying that he cannot cross his boundary. With folded hands in the interview, Tripathi said that now he will also tell the directors that &ldquo;whatever is left will be done the next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Deepika Padukone recently stepped out of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/spirit-exclusive-sandeep-reddy-vanga-gears-up-for-an-a-rated-film-with-prabhas-and-tripti-dimri-1389529">Sandeep Reddy Vanga</a>&rsquo;s Spirit opposite Prabhas over work hour issue. She demanded an 8-hour shift and Rs 40 crore remuneration, both of which were&nbsp;rejected by the Animal filmmaker. This led to their fallout and the actress being replaced by Triptii Dimri in the film.</p>

<p>On the work front, Pankaj Tripathi&rsquo;s latest OTT show, Criminal Justice Season 4, was released. The show has only 3 episodes left, which has&nbsp;left fans disheartened.</p>

<p>Apart from this, certain reports of him replacing Paresh Rawal in Hera Pheri 3 started doing the rounds after an AI image of him as Baburao spread on the internet. But nothing of this sort has been confirmed yet.</p>

The actress reportedly asked for a fixed schedule and Rs 40 crore in remuneration, which did not go well with the Animal director, resulting in her replacement. Well, Ajay Devgn recently supported Deepika, and now, the recent name to get added to this list is&nbsp;Mani Ratnam, who called her demand an &lsquo;absolute necessity&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="68d4dcb8a3eaa"><strong>What did Mani Ratnam say to support Deepika Padukone?</strong></h2>

<p>Mani Ratnam is currently busy promoting his upcoming movie Thug Life. Talking to News 18 about the recent Deepika Padukone and Sandeep Reddy Vanga row, the director backed the actress and stood in her support.</p>

<p>He stated that, according to him, it is a rightful demand, and he is glad that the Bajirao Mastani actress is in a position to ask for it. He further spoke on behalf of all the filmmakers and said that &ldquo;one will always take these things into consideration when casting.&rdquo; It is not an unreasonable thing to ask, but an absolute necessity. &ldquo;I think that should be the priority. You have to acknowledge that, understand it, and work around it,&rdquo; revealed the director.</p>

<h2 id="68d4dcb8a3eb6"><strong>Why did Deepika Padukone walk out of Sandeep Reddy Vanga&rsquo;s Spirit?</strong></h2>

<p>The reports of Deepika being quite impressed with Spirit&rsquo;s storyline and how Sandeep Reddy Vanga developed her character in the film started making the rounds. Soon after that, fans were left jumping with joy after there were reports of her giving a nod to the Prabhas starrer. But their happiness was short-lived as soon after, the news of her stepping out spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>As per sources, the Bajirao Mastani actress decided to part ways from the venture owing to&nbsp;failure to meet her demands by the producers and directors. The details that came out referred to that Deepika had apparently quoted a remuneration of Rs 40 crore from the makers while they were only interested in paying her Rs 20 crore. Additionally, the actress wanted her schedule fixed, providing her with adequate time for her personal life.</p>

<p>As the initial negotiations itself was failing to hold ground, Sandeep Reddy Vanga asked the actress to learn Telugu for the role to act and dub herself. Owing to all these factors, Deepika Padukone reportedly walked out of the project.</p>

<p>The actress has been receiving unwavering support for her stand after&nbsp;being replaced by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/food-travel/a-look-at-triptii-dimris-aesthetic-travel-photos-on-instagram-1389381">Triptii Dimri</a> in Spirit.</p>

<h2 id="68d4dcb8a3ebc"><strong>Deepika Padukone&rsquo;s work front</strong></h2>

<p>Currently, the actress is enjoying her maternity break after the birth of her daughter Dua. She will soon be seen opposite Shah Rukh Khan in King, which also stars Suhana Khan.</p>

The ardent fans of the royal couple are always interested in getting insights about their lifestyle. In a new interview, the Daayra actress opened up about her routine and what their &lsquo;mundane&rsquo; day looks like. Her answer is bound to surprise you as it is not something you might have expected.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Nod Magazine, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/kareena-kapoor-reveals-what-she-cherished-most-about-dating-ex-boyfriend-shahid-kapoor-check-out-her-throwback-confession-1395824">Kareena Kapoor</a> stated that the pandemic taught her the joy of doing things together, slowing down, and finding joy in the mundane. She called her brick-stone kitchen &lsquo;the happiest part of the house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Reflecting on a &lsquo;mundane&rsquo; day, Bebo shared that she and her husband, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/did-saif-ali-khan-share-a-strained-bond-with-mom-sharmila-tagore-due-to-her-weeks-long-absences-1393406">Saif Ali Khan</a>, love cooking together as a family. &ldquo;Saif, the kids, me&mdash;we&rsquo;re all in the kitchen,&rdquo; she says. In fact, the royal couple blends spices and cultures well.</p>

<p>Kareena revealed that Saif Ali Khan is &lsquo;obsessed&rsquo; with Kerala cuisine and that he is always trying out new recipes, including idiyappams, coconut-based stews, and everything. She, on the other hand, needs a proper Indian meal a day, which is a &lsquo;non-negotiable&rsquo; for her.</p>

<p>Growing personally and professionally, Bebo&rsquo;s choices have also evolved over the years. She is now focusing on a routine that is more monastic. She revealed that she has her dinner by 6 pm, goes to sleep by 9:30 pm, and works out early in the morning &lsquo;before the world wakes up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The 44-year-old mentioned, &ldquo;My friends know not to expect me at parties. And they respect that,&rdquo; further adding on a lighter note that they know she would be watching Schitt&rsquo;s Creek on low volume. In addition to this, the actress expressed happiness that she has moved past the stage of constantly running from one thing to the next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to her, she realized the importance of fitness post-COVID, not for vanity, but for one&rsquo;s overall well-being. The actress is often seen sharing her fitness goals through yoga sessions and strength training videos, which she says are her &lsquo;mood stabilizer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Workwise, Bebo has also dabbled in the digital space with projects like The Buckingham Murders and Jaane Jaan, striking a balance with commercial films like Crew and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/ajay-devgn-finally-addresses-creative-flaws-in-rohit-shettys-singham-again-and-makes-genuine-promise-to-movie-fans-aage-se-1369796">Singham Again</a>. To this, the actress reasons that it is no longer about quantity for her, but about choosing the right roles, which challenge and excite her. &ldquo;I want to preserve my energy, my talent, myself,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Last seen in Singham Again, Kareena will next be seen in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/daayra-kareena-kapoor-and-prithviraj-sukumarans-collaboration-helmed-by-meghna-gulzar-officially-announced-actress-calls-it-dream-team-1382315">Daayra</a>, which will be directed by Meghna Gulzar, known for movies like Raazi and Sam Bahadur.

Co-written by Yash and Sima alongside Meghna, the film is currently in pre-production.</p>

<p>In addition to this, she will also be seen in Netflix&rsquo;s reality drama show, Dining With The Kapoors. The show will feature the entire Kapoor clan, including Neetu Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor, Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, Randhir Kapoor, and Karisma Kapoor, among others, who will share their filmy memories and personal experiences in the upcoming show.</p>

Sharing how doctors performed the surgery, the actress mentioned, &quot;They put a stoma on him. They basically pulled the intestine out of the body, and it was an exposed stoma.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking the conversation forward, the Bheed actress mentioned COVID-19 and said that she was allowed to visit Avyaan only twice a week, and mentioned how the pandemic increased her concerns. Dia could not hold him until he was 2.5 kg, and then she brought him home for exactly 20 days. After the little boy gradually gained strength and weighed 3.5 kg, he underwent another surgery, and the stoma was corrected.</p>

<p>In the same interview, the Nadaniyaan&nbsp;actress made a heartfelt revelation about writing a book for her son. The book compiles her pregnancy journey and details every aspect of her complicated delivery. Stating how Avyaan has taught her &#39;grace,&#39; Dia said that it takes a lot of grace to survive, endure, and smile through the pain that Avyaan has experienced.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Dia Mirza was earlier married to her longtime business partner, Sahil Sangha. They got separated in 2019, and later she got hitched to businessman Vaibhav Rekhi&nbsp;in 2021. The couple turned parents to Avyaan the same year. Well, the actress also has a stepdaughter, Samaira, from Vaibhav&#39;s previous marriage.</p>

<p>Earlier, Pinkvilla exclusively revealed that the producers submitted two separate cuts of the comedy thriller to the CBFC.

Umrao Jaan starring ever-charming Bollywood&nbsp;diva Rekha is set to release on&nbsp;the big screen again. The cult-classic movie has been restored in 4K quality by the film bodies, National Film Archive of India (NFAI) and National Film Development Corporation (NFDC). Termed among the finest Hindi movies of all time, Umrao Jaan is now gearing up for its return to cinemas on June 27th. However, it won&#39;t be a clear run for the re-release as the film will be facing a major clash at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Directed by Muzaffar Ali, the timeless classic is all set to face Kajol starrer mythological-horror drama, Maa, in a major clash. While Umrao Jaan is expected to re-release on limited shows, the latter is likely to grab most of the screens with an extensive release. Interestingly, both movies celebrate women in different genres. It will be a treat for cinema lovers to experience two female-led movies in&nbsp;a single day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Kajol&#39;s Maa is directed by Vishal Furia and produced by Ajay Devgn and Kumar Mangat Pathak. The horror movie is marketed as a part of the Shaitaan universe, which might help it to attract moviegoers and give it an upper hand against rival releases.</p>

<p>Umrao Jaan, on the other hand, holds a legacy of artistic cinema, whose beautifully penned songs often go viral on instagram. The Rekha starrer has the potential to strike chords with the new-gen audience and emerge as a new sensation on social media.</p>

<p>Originally released in 1981, Umrao Jaan stars Farooq Shaikh as Umrao&#39;s love interest, Naseeruddin Shah, Raj Babbar, Shaukat Kaifi, Dina Pathak, Satish Shah, and others. The movie explores the love, loss, and longing of a 19th-century&nbsp;Lucknow-based courtesan-poetess, played by Rekha.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Umrao Jaan was a huge hit during its initial release. It remained etched in every cinephiles&rsquo; memory because of its evergreen music, composed by Khayyam. Rekha&#39;s legendary performance in the film&nbsp;made her win the National Film Award for Best Actress. It also boasts of a soulful music library which includes- Dil Cheez Kya Hai, In Aankhon Ki Masti, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Restored in 4K version for the contemporary audience, Umrao Jaan will be re-released by PVR Inox as part of their Timeless Classics initiative, which previously re-released some of the landmark movies of Hindi cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mahvash was spotted in the stands cheering him on. When the leg-spinner dismissed MI&rsquo;s key batter Suryakumar Yadav, she was visibly thrilled, jumping with excitement and hooting in celebration.</p>

<p>Chahal is now set to travel to Gujarat&nbsp;for the IPL 2025 final, where his team, Punjab Kings (PBKS), will face off against Virat Kohli&rsquo;s Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.</p>

<p>RJ Mahvash, who has been a regular presence at Chahal&rsquo;s key matches, is unlikely to miss the high-stakes finale. The much-awaited IPL 2025 final is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 3.</p>

<p>Rumors about Yuzvendra Chahal and RJ Mahvash&rsquo;s alleged relationship began circulating around the time his marriage with Dhanashree Verma reportedly faced turbulence. The cricketer and Dhanashree officially parted ways in March this year, and since then, Mahvash has often been seen by Chahal&rsquo;s side, fueling further speculation about their bond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rumors linking RJ Mahvash and Yuzvendra Chahal began circulating following his reported separation from Dhanashree Verma, especially after the two were spotted together on multiple occasions. Although Mahvash had previously denied the speculations, the gossip intensified when they were seen attending a Champions Trophy match in Dubai.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mahvash is embarking on a new chapter in her career, having recently made her acting debut in Pyar Paisa Profit,&nbsp;&nbsp;a series based on Durjoy Datta&rsquo;s novel Now That You&rsquo;re Rich&hellip; Let&rsquo;s Fall In Love. The show, available on Amazon MX Player, features actors like Pratik Yadav, Mihir Ahuja, Neil Bhoopalam, Nitish Sharma, Shivangi Khedkar, and Ashish Raghav.</p>

Following Paresh Rawal&#39;s exit from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/did-akshay-kumar-fake-paresh-rawal-fight-for-hera-pheri-3-actor-says-this-is-publicity-1394603">Hera Pheri 3</a>, some AI-generated images circulated online that depicted Pankaj Tripathi as Baburao. The photos created quite a stir online, and amid all this, the Criminal Justice 4 actor shared his views on the fake AI-generated videos and misinformation that often surface on social media.</p>

<p>Days after his AI avatar, as Paresh&nbsp;Rawal&#39;s&nbsp;Baburao surfaced on the internet, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/meet-actor-who-studied-under-tree-till-grade-5-did-night-shift-at-hotel-survived-on-wifes-money-and-now-1392638">Pankaj Tripathi</a>, in a new interview with Zoom, shared his views on&nbsp;AI technology. He mentioned that he is not afraid or concerned about it. The veteran actor recalled reading an article in his childhood about science that emphasized that it is both a boon and a curse.</p>

<p>Tripathi argued that if science is used meaningfully, then it is a fantastic thing. However, if it is used without any meaning, it can be harmful. He asserted that every technology should&#39;ve a meaningful use. He noted that if there is a technology, it is bound to have both kinds of uses. However, an individual should be aware that the content they&#39;re consuming is generated, real, or original.</p>

<p>He added, &quot;How much will you see and how much you will dissect or understand it? You have to live your life and work too. I am not scared because no matter how much technology evolves, human emotions have a lot of value, and that is not going to change.&quot;</p>

<p>For the unversed, it was just a couple of days back that Tripathi&#39;s AI-generated image went viral on the internet. It showed the actor styled with Paresh Rawal-portrayed&nbsp;Baburao&#39;s iconic thick-rimmed glasses and trademark hairstyle. He was also seen dressed in the character&#39;s familiar white dhoti and vest, complete with a gold chain and bracelet, reprising the classic look. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On the professional front, Pankaj Tripathi is currently enjoying the release of his legal drama series, Criminal Justice 4. Directed by Rohan Sippy, the show also features Surveen Chawla, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub, Asha Negi, Barkha Singh, Mita Vashisht, and Shweta Basu Prasad among others. It is currently streaming on JioHotstar. &nbsp;</p>

You won’t believe how they reacted to paps clicking them together]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/1277953779_katrina-2.jpg"></img><p>Bollywood stars Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif are one of the most adored couples in the industry. They never fail to give major couple goals. From quietly dating away from the spotlight to showing public support for each other, they&rsquo;ve become the ultimate couple goals. Their first public appearance together came after a Diwali party, sparking widespread speculation about their relationship. Despite the buzz, the couple chose to stay silent and later surprised fans by tying the knot in an intimate ceremony. Now, renowned paparazzo Manav Manglani opened up on their reaction after their first public sighting and revealed that the couple realized at that moment they had been seen together publicly for the very first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an interview with Vishal Malhotra, well-known paparazzo Manav Manglani opened up on Katrina Kaif and Vicky Kaushal&rsquo;s first spotting after attending producer Amritpal Singh Bindra&rsquo;s Diwali party. He shared that the moment was entirely unplanned.</p>

<p>There were already rumors about them being close friends or even more than that but they hadn&rsquo;t been seen together. However, Manav shared that his team first clicked Vicky and Katrina&rsquo;s first photo together as they were coming out of the bash. He talked about their outfits as the actress stunned in a red lehenga while Vicky looked dapper in a beige kurta-pajama.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He recalled that as the duo were trying to locate their cars, his team happened to spot them. It was only when they noticed the cameras that they realized they&#39;d been captured together for the first time in public. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when it hit them; they had been seen together publicly for the first time. That photo went viral, and how,&rdquo; the paparazzo shared.</p>

<p>Earlier, while talking to Karan Johar on his famous chat show Koffee With Karan, Katrina Kaif opened up on falling in love with Vicky Kaushal and shared that she didn&rsquo;t have much of an idea about him before they met. She added he was &lsquo;just a name&rsquo; she had heard, but she was impressed after meeting him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Merry Christmas actress expressed that it felt like destiny, describing the experience as something truly meant to be. She mentioned that a series of coincidences made it all feel almost unreal at one point.</p>

<p>Katrina also revealed that the first person she opened up to about her feelings for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sanjay-leela-bhansali-sets-up-love-and-war-as-ranbir-kapoor-vs-vicky-kaushal-1378239">Love &amp; War</a>&nbsp;actor was filmmaker Zoya Akhtar.

After Ajay Devgn came to the actress&rsquo; support, Radhika Apte, who is also a new mother, claimed that the industry is &ldquo;not conducive to the needs of a new mother&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Lust Stories actress&nbsp;announced her pregnancy last year as she flaunted her baby bump on the red carpet of BAFTA Awards. She was there as her British film, Sister Midnight, was nominated&nbsp;in the Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer category. Apte&nbsp;welcomed a baby girl in December 2024 with her husband, Benedict Taylor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a recent interview with SCREEN, the Andhadhun fame&nbsp;was asked if the film industry is encouraging towards the needs of new mothers. In response, the actress shared her concern, expressing, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they are. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to navigate that going ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She further explained her reason, noting that an actor rarely gets the time to see their child, considering long shoot hours. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really difficult to work in our film industry, given the number of hours and how we film generally, and the time for which we don&rsquo;t get to see the child. So I guess I&rsquo;ll just have to figure it out now,&rdquo; Radhika further added.</p>

<p>Notably, this comes days after a Bollywood Hungama report claimed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ranveer-singh-calls-deepika-padukone-hot-mamma-as-she-turns-heads-in-style-for-louis-vuitton-1396412">Deepika Padukone</a> was ousted from Sandeep Reddy Vanga&rsquo;s Spirit after she demanded changes in her contract through her agency. It was reported that the actress refused to shoot for more than 6 hours a day. The report also claimed that the actress demanded extra pay&nbsp;for every single day if the shoot extended beyond 100 days.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ajay-devgn-has-a-hilarious-birthday-wish-on-wife-kajols-birthday-you-would-still-roll-your-eyes-1395110">Ajay Devgn</a>, on the other hand, during the trailer launch of Maa, also reacted to the row and assured that most of the &quot;honest filmmakers&quot; don&rsquo;t have any problem with these demands. He also claimed that most people have started working 8-9-hour shifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After getting a release in the UK and the US later in 2024, Apte&rsquo;s Sister Midnight has finally been released in India. It is currently running in the theaters.</p>

An emotional fan wrote, &quot;Missing Betts and Reggie!!!!,&quot; Another fan exclaimed, &quot;Sunshine in London!&quot;</p>

<p>A third fan complimented, &quot;Postcard-perfect face in a postcard-perfect place,&quot; and another complimented, &quot;His fashion sense &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;. Moreover, one fan proclaimed, &quot;Alexa play London Boy by Taylor Swift.&quot; Furthermore, another praised Raina&#39;s&nbsp;good looks, hailing them as &quot;Straight out of pinterest&quot;.</p>

<p>Notably, Khushi and Vedang have not officially confirmed their relationship. However, their public sightings and mushy gestures towards each other often grab fans&#39; attention. It was only last month that the Loveyapa actress made it to the headlines as she flaunted her pendant with the initials of her and Vedang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the professional front, Vedang will next be seen in Imtiaz Ali&rsquo;s period romantic film with Diljit Dosanjh and Naseeruddin Shah. We also informed you that the director has cast Sharvari as the female lead in the upcoming project.&nbsp;</p>

Walking down memory lane, Dia&nbsp;shared how she started calling her stepfather &#39;abba&#39; right after her mother married him. The actress, in a &#39;child&rsquo;s heart and little mind&#39;, was extremely accepting of him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dia revealed that her stepfather was not a hugger, cuddler, or someone who expressed his emotions. Rather, they turned him into a hugger, and it was only the last time he gave her a tight hug before his demise.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember the last time I met him in Hyderabad before I went to an overseas shoot, during which time he passed away (in 2003). I&rsquo;ll never forget the hug he gave me and the tears he had in his eyes as he said goodbye,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Dia Mirza was previously married to Sahil Sangha, but after five years of their marriage, they got divorced in 2019. She later tied the nuptial knot to businessman Vaibhav Rekhi in 2021 and welcomed their first child in May of the same year. The couple named him Avyaan Azaad Rekhi, who was born premature&nbsp;and was in the NICU for 2 months.&nbsp;</p>

After Aamir Khan, the latest one to join the discussion is none other than Rajpal Yadav, who mentioned that nepotism doesn&#39;t only exist. He went on to name the likes of Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, and more to elucidate his point.</p>

<p>In a recent interaction with ANI, Rajpal Yadav claimed that there is &#39;no nepotism&#39; in the industry. He stated that he would like to speak &#39;honestly&#39; about it. The Bhool Bhulaiyaa actor said that if there were nepotism, then&nbsp;there wouldn&#39;t have been&nbsp;Shah Rukh Khan, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Rawal, Anupam Kher, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-akshay-kumar-reveals-his-character-in-jaani-dushman-woke-up-from-coma-because-he-needed-money-for-this-reason-reacts-to-viral-behen-darr-gayi-meme-1368719">Akshay Kumar</a>, Johny Lever, Sanjeev Kumar, Rajesh Khanna, and Dharmendra. &nbsp;</p>

<p>He stated that it was his desire to join Bollywood or the theater, and nobody in his family had insisted that he do so. The actor revealed that he has also told his kids that no one can make anyone&#39;s career in sports and cinema. According to him, it is only one&#39;s good nature that resides within them that tells him if they are capable of doing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajpal believes even if he pushes anyone, he can&#39;t prevent the debacles they would face later in life. The De Dana Dan actor acknowledges that an individual would get an opportunity for the first time, but whether he will succeed or have that energy is decided by the Almighty or the audience, emphasizing that there is no nepotism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been acting for 38 years now. And I have at least 200 relatives. Mai to ek ko bhi nahin karva paaya...dekhiye blessings apni apni.. mehnat apni hai (I haven&#39;t been able to get them work here. It is blessings, hard work), and finally it is the audience who decides,&quot; he further added.</p>

<p>In another interview with Raj Shamani, Aamir Khan also addressed the nepotism debate, stating that he has neither interfered in his son Junaid Khan&#39;s career nor will he ever do that in the future. The veteran actor also claimed that no one can uplift anyone&#39;s career in the acting industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the professional front, Yadav is currently enjoying the release of his movie, Interrogation, on Zee 5.&nbsp;</p>

Actor confesses making ex-wife Kiran Rao cry because of his ‘ego’ ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/1979343212_aamir-khan-kiran-rao.jpg"></img><p>Aamir Khan has had quite a fruitful professional career, but in his personal life, he couldn&rsquo;t escape &lsquo;red flags&rsquo; in him. During a recent interaction with Raj Shamani, the actor recalled how his &lsquo;ego&rsquo; once made his ex-wife Kiran Rao cry at night.</p>

<p>When asked if he had had any &lsquo;red flags,&rsquo; Aamir Khan admitted that being a &lsquo;workaholic&rsquo; was one of them. He accepted that he was quite lost in his work initially. Sitaare Zameen Par actor further mentioned that he used to be very &lsquo;emotional&rsquo; and would go silent for 3&ndash;4 days after being hurt. But, Aamir claims that he has improved in that aspect now.</p>

<p>Khan explained his point by recalling how he and his ex-wife Kiran Rao once had an argument, that left him quite hurt. Despite living in the same house, and sharing the same room and bed, he nearly stopped talking to her. He&nbsp;was only having a&nbsp;cut-to-cut conversation with Kiran Rao at that time&nbsp;and told her that he wasn&rsquo;t happy with her. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The 60-year-old pointed out Rao&rsquo;s state of mind, who was quite upset with the argument, and even more&nbsp;for Khan who was not responding to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Bilkul response nahin kar raha...itna hard... 4th-day&nbsp;raat ko vo mujhse baat karne ki koshish kar rahi thi aur main bilkul jawab nahin de raha tha to ek point pe vo rone lagi aur unhone kaha mujhe samjh nahin aa raha main kya karun aap to bilkul respond hi nahin kar rahe ho (I wasn&#39;t responding at all. So hard, and on the 4th night, she was trying to talk to me, and at one point, she started crying. She said I&#39;m not understanding what should I do as you&#39;re not responding).&quot;</p>

<p>The actor stated that he had two emotions going on inside him&mdash;anger, that made him neither forgive nor speak to her. &quot;Deep hurt ...ego is a very right word for that,&quot; he accepted.</p>

<p>The 3 Idiots fame further added that&nbsp;despite wanting to reconcile, he couldn&#39;t take that step.&nbsp;On a concluding note, Aamir admitted to having a red flag where he wouldn&rsquo;t forgive a person after being hurt, which he realized after therapy.&nbsp;</p>

Find out how]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/363642589_hhh.jpg"></img><p>The acclaimed series Panchayat, celebrated for its authentic depiction of rural India, is set to return with its fourth season on July 2, 2025, on Amazon Prime Video. The recently released teaser has only added to the excitement among fans looking forward to revisiting the village of Phulera. Interestingly, the show&rsquo;s director drew inspiration from the beloved classic Malgudi Days and its rural theme; interestingly, he named it after the book series Panchatantra.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Director Deepak Kumar Mishra has credited classic Indian television, particularly Malgudi Days, as a significant inspiration for Panchayat. He expressed a desire to revive the viewers&#39; fondness for such shows and relate that to reality. Mishra aimed to present a narrative that resonates with the simplicity and depth of village life, reminiscent of the storytelling in Malgudi Days.</p>

<p>During the release of the second season, director Deepak Kumar Mishra shared the reasoning behind naming the series Panchayat.</p>

<p>The director shared, &quot;A panchayat in India is the personification of what village life is. I wanted to revive the viewers&rsquo; fondness for classic shows and relate that to reality. When we were kids, we grew up watching shows like Malgudi Days and Panchatantra. This had the essence of small village culture. We aimed to show the new-age generation what we grew up watching back in the day. &lsquo;Panchayat&rsquo;s name connects viewers to their motherlands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Panchayat follows Abhishek Tripathi, an engineering graduate who becomes the secretary of a Panchayat office in the fictional village of Phulera, Uttar Pradesh. The series delves into his experiences navigating the complexities of rural administration and community dynamics, offering a blend of humor and heartfelt moments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming season promises to continue exploring the intricacies of village politics and personal relationships, maintaining the show&#39;s signature charm and relatability. With its engaging storytelling and strong performances, Panchayat continues to be a standout series that captures the essence of rural India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new season of Panchayat is all set to premiere on Prime Video on July 2, 2025. The recently released teaser hints at the rising political tension in Phulera, as Pradhan Ji and Bhushan go head-to-head in a bid for victory. The upcoming season promises to unveil the fate of Phulera like never before.</p>

In addition to this, he also shared his views and take on&nbsp;nepotism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a recent interview with Raj Shamani, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/aamir-khan-express-distress-over-brother-faissal-khans-hurtful-statement-about-him-and-family-1395397">Aamir Khan</a> admitted that his children&#39;s lives and future are more important to him than his own. He talked about his son Junaid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/aamir-khan-ladylove-gauri-spratt-son-junaid-khan-spend-beautiful-evening-with-shikhar-dhawan-and-his-rumored-gf-sophie-shine-pic-1383207" target="_blank">Khan&#39;</a>s&nbsp;Loveyapa, stating, &quot;Loveyapa aayi, nahin chali. Mujhe to film achi lagi thi (Loveyapa didn&#39;t work, but I liked it),&quot; further noting that his son did a great job at it.</p>

<p>Mr. Perfectionist further stressed on &#39;amazing quality&#39; of his son becoming a character in the film, which he is not in real life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When further asked his views on the reason behind&nbsp;Loveyapa&#39;s&nbsp;failure, the Sitaare Zameen Par argued that the film received a &quot;negative backlash.&quot;</p>

<p>He said, &quot;Vo troll bahut hui film... nepotism mein bahut chali gayi ki yaar nepotism, ye nepokids hain...jabki Junaid aur main aise hain hi nahin (The film was widely trolled. It got into nepotism debate that they&#39;re nepo-kids while me and Junaid are not like that).&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Khan further elaborated on his point by citing the example of his sister, Nikhat Khan, highlighting how she began acting at the age of 50. He mentioned that she had always screen-tested for the roles she landed without his support. He mentioned getting work to his close ones is something he just can&#39;t do because it would be unfair to the film.</p>

<p>&quot;Up till now, I have not interfered in Junaid&#39;s career, nor do I want to,&quot; said the 60-year-old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to this, he also emphasized his stance on nepotism, highlighting how he intended to support his brother, Faisal Khan, in the early stages of his career. He remembered working with his brother in Mela after his debut film flopped. Despite putting in immense efforts, Mr. Perfectionist admitted that he couldn&#39;t do much for his career. It is then that he realized that one cannot really help anyone in this field.</p>

<p>&quot;Main upar wale se prarthna kar sakta hoon ki mera success usko (Junaid) de do iske aage main kuch nahin kar sakta hoon (I can only pray to God to give all my success to Junaid and nothing more than that),&quot; he said on a concluding note.</p>

But belonging to the same generation and having started their careers almost at the same time, was there ever a sense of competition amongst them? Sitare Zameen Par actor spills beans on the &lsquo;healthy competition&rsquo; between them during the 90s and went on to praise Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.</p>

<p>Raj Shamani, in his podcast, asked <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-3-idiots-and-pk-aamir-khan-and-rajkumar-hirani-in-discussion-for-their-third-collaboration-1387460">Aamir Khan</a> about him competing with Shah Rukh Khan and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/salman-khan-has-finalized-his-next-project-after-sikandar-actor-in-talks-to-lead-a-war-film-report-1385287">Salman Khan</a>. The Laal Singh Chadha actor admitted that at one point, they used to compete. &ldquo;Har koi ye chahta hai ki sabse zyada wo successful ho, sabse zyada log uske kaam ko pasand kare, aur ye acchi baatein hoti hai.&rdquo; (Everyone wants they be very successful, and people should love their films the most, and this is a good thing.)</p>

<p>The actor further added that he never believes in negativity, and he can never do negative things. He confessed that the competition from his side has always been healthy. The PK star explained that he always gets inspired by others&#39; work, and he never gets upset with their success. His competition has always been with himself.</p>

<p>Talking about competition further, Aamir Khan spoke about Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. &ldquo;Mujhe ye nahi tha ki main DDLJ jaisi badi romantic film karu kyuki mujhe wo film achi lagti hai. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/after-8-years-bombay-high-court-approves-rs-62-lakh-compensation-for-shah-rukh-khans-red-chillies-employees-family-deets-1387486">SRK</a> ne bahut kamaal ka kaam kiya hai. Bahut achi lagti hai mujhe, mujhe bhi dekh ke mazaa aata hai. To main usse thodi compete kar raha hu,&rdquo; he exclaimed. (I did not have in mind to do a romantic film like DDLJ because I like that film and I enjoy watching it. So, I am not competing.)</p>

<p>On the work front, Aamir Khan is all geared up for the release of Sitaare Zameen Par. The film will mark his return to the big screen after Laal Singh Chaddha&rsquo;s debacle.</p>

Singer REACTS during Mumbai concert]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/2092373992_himesh.jpg"></img><p>Well, we are sure that if Paresh Rawal does not play Baburao in Hera Pheri 3, then the experience of watching this comedy caper is just not going to be the same for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Bollywood Hungama reported that Paresh Rawal has exited Hera Pheri 3 due to creative differences between him and the makers. Later, the actor himself took to X (formerly Twitter) and shared that his decision to step away from Hera Pheri 3 wasn&#39;t due to creative differences. He also shared having &quot;immense love, respect, and faith&quot;&nbsp;in filmmaker Priyadarshan.</p>

<p>Earlier, Pinkvilla exclusively reported that the producers of Hera Pheri 3, Cape of Good Films, have sent a legal notice to Paresh Rawal for damages of Rs 25 crore. A source shared, &quot;Cape of Good Films had procured the rights of Hera Pheri 3 from multiple stakeholders and even repaid all the debts existing on the film. The amount splurged was in crores, as the intent was to get back Hera Pheri on the big screen after 20 years for the audience. Paresh&#39;s unprofessional behaviour has cost a bomb to the film.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, amidst all this, we really hope Paresh Rawal returns as Baburao in the 3rd part.</p>

The actor, who is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie Sitaare Zameen Par, plans to begin work on this magnum opus right after. Sometime back, Mr. Perfectionist had opened up about retiring. And now, in a recent interview, he yet again hinted at Mahabharat being his last project.</p>

<p>Yes! You read&nbsp;that right. Aamir Khan might retire after working on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/mahabharat-aamir-khan-admits-being-deeply-moved-by-this-character-from-indian-epic-any-guesses-1386318">Mahabharat</a>. No, we are not saying this, but Aamir Khan himself hinted at this in a recent podcast with Raj Shamani. The actor was asked if he was about to make his last film; then, what does he want it to be about? The actor paused for a while, and what he replied will leave you surprised.</p>

<p>Replying to this question, Aamir admitted that it&#39;s his dream to make Mahabharat. He further revealed that he would start&nbsp;work on it right after the release of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-aamir-khan-locks-june-20-release-for-sitaare-zameen-par-trailer-out-with-raid-2-1383061">Sitaare Zameen&nbsp;</a><span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-aamir-khan-locks-june-20-release-for-sitaare-zameen-par-trailer-out-with-raid-2-1383061" target="_blank">Par</a></span>. The Laal Singh Chadha star further added that after working on Mahabharat, maybe he will get the feeling that now he has nothing left in him to do. He cannot do anything after this, as the material of this film is going to be like that.</p>

<p>&quot;Layered hai, emotion hai, scale hai, har cheez hai usme. Har cheez jo duniya me hai wo aapko Mahabharat me milegi,&quot; added the star.</p>

<p>He further quipped, &quot;I hope that I die with my shoes on, lekin kyuki aap puch rahe to ek hi cheez hai jo main soch sakta hu. Shayad ye karne ke baad mere andar wo emotion aaye ki ab iske baad mujhe kuch nahi karna, shayad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While talking to The Hollywood Reporter a while back, Aamir spoke about Mahabharat. &quot;That&#39;s one of my biggest ambitions,&quot; he stated, adding that just the writing process will take a few years. Aamir said that he will be joining the team as one of the producers.</p>

<p>When asked if he will be acting in the film too, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/8-years-of-dangal-a-box-office-revisit-analysing-aamir-khans-rs-1900-crore-plus-global-juggernaut-1364186" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Dangal</a>&nbsp;actor stated, &quot;We&#39;ll see who we should cast based on who&#39;s appropriate for which part.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked if he would be taking over the director&#39;s chair for the magnum opus, the actor stated that Mahabharat is one film that can&#39;t be told in one go. While it&#39;s early to say if he will helm the movie, he divulged that the story will be told across multiple films. Hence, for that, they will need numerous directors if they have to plan it within a certain timeline.</p>

The actor has found love yet again for the third time in his life after separation from ex-wives Kiran Rao and Reena Dutta. But is he ready to get married for the third time? Sometime back, it was he who admitted that he would no longer get married, as he is already 59. So, what has changed now?</p>

<p>Talking to Raj Shamani in his podcast, Aamir Khan confessed that the arrival of his girlfriend Gauri Spratt has changed everything for him. It was after his divorce from Kiran Rao, the Laal Singh Chadha actor, that he had already aged, and it is unlikely for him to find someone now.</p>

<p>The actor further added that by this time, he had also started his therapy, and a realisation had struck him that he needed to work on his health first.</p>

<p>Aamir also confessed that he has had a very deep relationship with both his ex-wives, and he felt that now he wouldn&rsquo;t find anyone with whom he would share the same love, respect, and bond. But then, by mistake, he crossed paths with Gauri Spratt.</p>

<p>Sitaare Zameen Par star revealed that they met, connected, and their friendship increased, soon turning into love. Before the actor met Gauri, he was certain that he no longer wanted a partner in life, and the reason was his healthy relationships with his children, siblings, and parents. In fact, Aamir admitted that he still shared a great bond with both his ex-wives, and they are an inseparable part of his life, which will never change.</p>

<p>He convinced himself with the fact that no other relationship in his life would be as deep as these two, and he did not feel the need to have a partner anymore. But after he met Gauri, everything changed in his life for good.</p>

<p>Talking about his work front, Aamir Khan is all geared up for the release of his upcoming movie Sitaare Zameen Par. This film also marks his return to acting after Laal Singh Chaddha (2022), which did not fare well commercially. Expectations are running high for this film, not just from fans, but from the industry as well. Moreover, it marks the comeback of&nbsp;Genelia Deshmukh&nbsp;to mainstream Bollywood cinema.&nbsp;</p>

Before entering the spotlight as an actress, she gained experience working behind the camera as an assistant director on films such as Bajirao Mastani.</p>

He&rsquo;d probably make a good &lsquo;Babu Bhaiya&rsquo; type character in a spin-off or reboot, but stepping into Paresh Rawal&rsquo;s shoes directly would feel off. Audiences would constantly compare them, and the charm of the original might get lost. So respectfully, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another added, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be how it was for Robert Pattinson in Batman.&rdquo; One comment read, &quot;Both are good actors. But this role can be done by one and only Paresh Rawal.&quot;</p>

<p>Suniel Shetty had earlier shared his surprise over Paresh Rawal&rsquo;s departure from Hera Pheri 3, emphasizing that the film simply couldn&rsquo;t move forward without the veteran actor.</p>

<p>In a conversation with ANI, Shetty reportedly stated that while the project might still have a slim chance of continuing without him or Akshay Kumar, it was impossible to imagine it without Paresh Rawal.</p>

<p>He noted that the dynamic between Raju and Shyam would fall flat without Baburao&#39;s iconic presence. In a separate interview with Zoom, Shetty further highlighted that the film&rsquo;s lasting impact came from its beloved characters, Raju, Shyam, and Baburao, rather than the actors themselves, stressing that no one could replace the original trio.</p>

<p>With this in mind, fans continue to hope that Rawal might reconsider and return to the franchise.</p>

He pointed out that abuse can manifest in various forms, not just s*xual, but also mental, emotional, and psychological, which can be equally damaging.</p>

<p>Mehta further remarked that toxic behavior in creative environments is often masked as &lsquo;passion&rsquo; or &lsquo;genius,&rsquo; a mindset he believes must end. He stressed that no artistic pursuit, whether a film, script, or any other project, is worth compromising an individual&#39;s safety or mental well-being.</p>

<p>The note further read, &ldquo;Victims need voice. They need redress. They need a system that listens and acts. Accountability is not cancel culture. It is culture correction. We owe it to ourselves, and to those who come after us, to make our spaces safer. Cleaner. Kinder. Call out the predators. Call out the habitual abuser. Hold them accountable. Let no power be above decency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dharma Productions recently broke its silence on the accusations and stated that it maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment against anyone associated with their projects, treating such cases with utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>They clarified that Pratik Shah was engaged as a freelancer on the film Homebound for a limited duration, and his association with the production has since ended. During his time working on the project, their internal POSH committee did not receive any complaints against him from the cast or crew involved with Homebound.</p>

<p>Following the emergence of allegations on social media, Pratik Shah took down his Instagram account. He has not issued any official statement addressing the accusations so far.</p>

<p>Shah was the cinematographer for Homebound, the sole Indian feature film showcased at this year&rsquo;s Cannes Film Festival. The film, directed by Neeraj Ghaywan, was produced under the banner of Karan Johar&#39;s Dharma Productions.</p>

Actress REACTS ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-05/1130473618_mamta-1.jpg"></img><p>Karan Arjun actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/hc-quashes-fir-against-mamta-kulkarni-in-drug-case-says-continuation-of-prosecution-would-be-abuse-of-court-1336875">Mamta Kulkarni</a> is one of the well-known actresses of the 90s. She recently made headlines after she returned to India after a 25-year absence and was appointed as Mahamandleshwar of Kinnar Akhada at the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. However, things took an unexpected turn and she had to step down. Now, she opened up about it and shared that her appointment was the result of her dedicated &lsquo;tapasya.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Months after the dispute, Mamta Kulkarni opened up about the controversy over her appointment as Mahamandleshwar of Kinnar Akhada for the first time. In a recent conversation with ANI, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/karan-arjun-box-office-collections-first-weekend-salman-khan-and-shah-rukh-khans-reincarnation-actioner-zoom-past-rs-1-crore-1359700">Karan Arjun</a> actress shared, &ldquo;It was all in God&rsquo;s hands for me to become Mahamandaleshwar in that Kumbh, which was such a holy occasion in 140 years.&rdquo; She further added, &ldquo;God provided me with the fruits of 25 years of my &lsquo;tapasya.&rsquo; So, that happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi announced that Mamta Kulkarni was appointed as the Mahamandleshwar of Kinnar Akhada during the Maha Kumbh Mela. As soon as the announcement was made, transgender Kathavachak Jagatguru Himangi Sakhi Maa criticized it, citing her involvement in criminal activities in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On January 30, 2025, the founder of Kinnar Akhada, Rishi Ajay Das, expelled Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi from her position. He shared that she deviated from the responsibilities she was given with the position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ajay alleged that the agreement Lakshmi made with Juna Akhada in 2019 was not valid as it lacked consent. He also took a dig at her for allowing Bollywood actress Mamta Kulkarni to join Akhada and take on the role of Mahamandaleshwar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calling it a betrayal of the Akhada&rsquo;s sacred values, Ajay questioned the ethical implications of giving such a prestigious title to someone having a criminal record.</p>

<p>This created a controversy and soon the president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, Mahant Ravindra Puri slammed him and questioned his right to remove Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi from her position. He also added that she and Mamta will continue with their positions.</p>

<p>As the controversy escalated, Mamta turned to social media to announce her resignation from the position. At the same time, the Kinnar Akhada officially removed Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi and Mamta Kulkarni, citing increasing discord within the community and concerns about their spiritual credentials.</p>

<p>Fans quickly flooded the comments section with reactions. One user wrote, &quot;Papa ne band bajadi, this is hilarious nana rapping.&quot; Another commented, &quot;Papa Toh Band Bajaye. Music.&quot; A third remarked, &quot;Most honest line in the world &#39;papa to band bajaye.&#39;&quot; While another added, &quot;&#39;Papa to band bajaye&#39; was nostalgia.&quot;</p>

<p>One user complimented Nana Patekar&rsquo;s performance and wondered, &quot;I&#39;m wondering how Nana Patekar was convinced for this type of pop rap song singing.&quot; Another comment nostalgically read, &quot;I can see the trios of Bluffmaster &amp; Heyy Babyy here. But sadly, they are not the same anymore. End of our childhood.&quot;</p>

Criminal Justice 4 actress reveals daughter knowing about v*gina]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-05/678038516_surveen.jpg"></img><p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/how-did-surveen-chawla-save-herself-from-being-kissed-by-a-director-criminal-justice-4-actress-recalls-traumatic-experience-1390133">Surveen Chawla</a>, recently seen alongside Pankaj Tripathi in Criminal Justice Season 4, spoke about how she introduced the concept of periods to her 3-year-old daughter. She emphasized the importance of using correct terms from the beginning, adding that her daughter is familiar with the word &#39;v*gina&#39; because that&rsquo;s what she has always been taught to call it.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Hauterrfly, Surveen Chawla shared that her daughter knows about sanitary pads and periods in an age-appropriate way. She shared that her daughter once entered her bathroom, opened her drawer and found a packet of sanitary pads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little girl questioned the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/criminal-justice-season-4-who-plays-what-in-pankaj-tripathi-led-legal-drama-know-full-cast-details-here-1389967">Criminal Justice Season 4</a> actress about it and was given a proper answer. Surveen told her about women releasing all the &lsquo;toxic blood&rsquo; from their bodies&nbsp;once a month and the sanitary pad just working like an adult diaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress mentioned that during times of discomfort, she simply tells her daughter that she&#39;s on her period and asks for some space.</p>

<p>Surveen Chawla also shared that she began educating her daughter about periods at the age of three. For her, the initial way a topic is introduced to a child leaves a lasting impression, making it essential to normalize such conversations early on.</p>

<p>She added, &ldquo;She knows what a v*gina is because that&#39;s all I&#39;ve called it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Surveen Chawla was recently seen in the much-awaited Criminal Justice Season 4. The show is led by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/criminal-justice-season-4-pankaj-tripathis-little-pep-talk-was-all-barkha-singh-needed-after-doubting-her-performance-find-out-what-he-said-1388798">Pankaj Tripathi,</a> who reprises his role as the sharp and unconventional lawyer Madhav Mishra. He takes charge of a new gripping case that tests his legal acumen once again.&nbsp;</p>

While these larger-than-life films have their place, they often leave a void for audiences who long for the simplicity, depth, and emotional richness of classic romantic tales. But 2025 seems to be rewriting the script. With a fresh slate of love stories on the horizon, Bollywood appears to be rediscovering its romantic roots, and audiences couldn&rsquo;t be more excited.</p>

<p>The upcoming film Saiyaara, featuring Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, is one of the most promising projects spearheading this shift. With a youthful cast and a reportedly heartfelt storyline, Saiyaara promises the kind of sincere, sweeping romance that once defined Bollywood in the era of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.</p>

<p>Ahaan, making his debut, brings a sense of freshness, while the chemistry with Padda is already generating buzz for its relatability and emotional depth.</p>

<p>Dhanush and Kriti Sanon&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/dhanush-turns-tere-ishk-mein-sets-into-holi-celebration-with-kriti-sanon-and-anand-l-rai-see-pic-1377452">Tere Ishk Mein,</a> directed by Aanand L. Rai, also offers a potent reminder of the emotional intensity that love stories can carry.</p>

<p>The film is said to be packed with raw passion, heartbreak, and vulnerability,&nbsp;&nbsp;all essential ingredients of the golden-era romances that Bollywood fans still hold dear. With Dhanush&#39;s intense screen presence and Kriti&rsquo;s charm, this film seems poised to tug at the heartstrings.</p>

<p>Another highly anticipated film is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-kill-lakshya-reunites-with-karan-johar-for-an-action-film-filming-begins-in-2025-1363298">Chand Mera Dil,</a> starring Ananya Panday and Lakshya Lalwani. The title alone evokes nostalgia, hinting at a story rooted in old-school romantic ideal,&nbsp;&nbsp;moonlit confessions, longing glances, and the kind of innocence Bollywood used to revel in. Lakshya, too, is shaping up to be a promising romantic hero, bringing subtlety and softness back into the mix.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Anurag Basu&rsquo;s<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-war-2-sitaare-zameen-par-metro-in-dino-saiyaara-and-maa-trailers-on-the-big-screen-with-akshay-kumars-housefull-5-1390104"> Metro... In Dino</a>, an ensemble film that promises to explore love in the modern era but through an emotional, grounded lens. As a spiritual successor to Life in a... Metro, this film seems poised to offer stories of complex relationships, heartbreak, and hope, proving that love in its many forms still deserves center stage.</p>

<p>Param Sundari, starring Sidharth Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor, and Kartik Aaryan&rsquo;s reported film with Telugu star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/fact-check-is-sreeleela-getting-married-soon-heres-the-truth-behind-her-viral-haldi-pictures-1390166">Sreeleela </a>are further indications that filmmakers are once again investing in love stories that are both rooted and refreshing.</p>

<p>These films appear less interested in bombastic action sequences and more focused on chemistry, emotion, and story,&nbsp;the very essence of romantic cinema.</p>

<p>This resurgence marks a welcome shift from formulaic action-heavy narratives back to storytelling that values emotional resonance. Audiences are craving vulnerability, realism, and the timeless appeal of falling in love, not superheroes, but human beings navigating life and connection.</p>

<p>In embracing the original charm of romance,&nbsp;the music, the heartbreak, the longing, Bollywood is not just reviving a genre, it&rsquo;s rekindling a cultural heartbeat. And in doing so, it reminds us that amid the chaos of modern cinema, the magic of love stories still holds the power to move us all.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I feel that by shifting away from the spectacle and returning to authentic, relatable love stories, filmmakers are reconnecting with audiences on a deeper level. As these upcoming films hit the screens, they carry the potential to revive the magic of classic Bollywood romance, proving that sometimes, the simplest stories of love and connection are the most powerful of all.</p>

He was recently in the news for his remark on the industry. He told The Hindu that he has left Mumbai and&nbsp;wants to stay away from the &lsquo;toxic&rsquo; film industry. He also added that the cinema&nbsp;is&nbsp;dying. Now, Chhaava director Laxman Utekar hit back at his remarks and claimed that he doesn&rsquo;t have the sensibility to accept the audiences&rsquo; tastes.</p>

<p>In an interview with Mama&rsquo;s Couch, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-laxman-utekar-hit-flop-hindi-movie-list-1372584">Laxman Utekar</a> criticized Anurag Kashyap and shared that he is wrong in saying that audiences don&#39;t have the sensibility to accept his film. He further added, &ldquo;Balki unki sensibility nahi hai audience ka taste accept karne ki.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/chhaava-ott-release-when-and-where-to-watch-vicky-kaushal-rashmika-mandanna-and-akshaye-khannas-biographical-period-drama-1381714">Chhaava</a> director further gave examples of films&rsquo; record-breaking collections of 700-800 crore that don&rsquo;t signify cinema is dying. He asked Anurag to take a look at the box office collection of Bahubali, RRR, Pushpa and even his film Chhaava, starring Vicky Kaushal in the lead role.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Laxman said the filmmaker should change his sensibility, as he is stuck in the same place. He also talked about it in detail and admitted that in today&rsquo;s time, audiences have more knowledge about films and are more updated, as they have cinema in their phones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further revealed that every three years cinema changes and now, as filmmakers, they have to update themselves as well. They cannot be stuck in the past blaming the audiences for not having sensibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier, in a conversation with The Hindu, Anurag Kashyap opened up on moving away from Mumbai to distance himself from the industry. He called it &#39;toxic&#39; and cited the loss of creativity and rising pressure from unrealistic expectations.</p>

<p>Now, in the same interview, Laxman Utekar opened up about it and asked Anurag to leave if he wants to, as nobody is forcing him to stay. He added that one can make films if they are creatively happy, but cannot put their heart into it if&nbsp;forced.&nbsp;</p>
