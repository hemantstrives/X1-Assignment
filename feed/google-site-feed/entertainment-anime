One expert likens the experience of boarding Titan to &ldquo;stepping inside a bomb made of Play-Doh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The passengers&mdash;Rush, Hamish Harding, Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, and Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet&mdash;were casualties of this venture built on ignored warnings. Internal footage and interviews also reveal how those inside the company feared retaliation for speaking up.</p>

<p>The Titan: The OceanGate Disaster documentary ultimately uncovers how a company that sold extreme adventure collapsed under its own reckless ambition. The OceanGate corporation ceased operations shortly after the incident and is now the subject of lawsuits and public scrutiny.</p>

Bonney, sharing Ginny&rsquo;s appetite and spirit, grows up happily under his care, believing Kuma to be her real father. Despite his continued involvement in the Revolutionary Army, Kuma always returns to care for Bonney.</p>

<p>However, Kuma soon boards up the church&rsquo;s windows when he realizes Bonney has inherited Ginny&rsquo;s disease&mdash;an incurable condition known as Sapphire Scales, which causes her skin to harden when exposed to sunlight.</p>

<p>Kuma seeks treatment from multiple doctors in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/anime/one-piece-episode-1125-sentomaru-faces-borsalino-recap-release-date-where-to-stream-and-more-1382015" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">One Piece Episode</a> 1132.

<p>One Piece Episode 1132 will end with Kuma learning that King Bekori is planning another atrocity&mdash;targeting the elderly and weak citizens in a campaign of fire and violence.</p>

<p>At the hotel, Chihiro questions Samura&rsquo;s intent to die alone. Samura explains that he fears the Malediction&rsquo;s power, especially for his daughter Iori, and insists that eliminating the Sword Saint is necessary.

<p>Samura ignores this and closes the door between them. The narrator then explains that the lai White Purity Style produces explosive force from Spirit Energy. Samura, preparing to strike with Tobimune, infuses it with Suzaku&#39;s firepower.</p>

<p>Chihiro, remembering their past encounter and realizing he must prove his worth, counters with his Enten and the lai White Purity Style as well. The Kagurabachi Chapter 82 spoilers end as both enchanted swords clash for the first time.</p>

The imposter confirms Kudo died earlier in the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/anime/kagurabachi-chapter-79-spoilers-hakuri-to-hide-shinuchi-as-shigyu-brothers-attack-deets-1388031" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">Kagurabachi Chapter</a> 81 spoilers.</p>
