The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein&nbsp;is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

The movie added Rs. 50 lakh to the tally on its Day 7, bringing the total cume to Rs. 6.50 crore in its opening week. </p>

<p>The courtroom drama, directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-and-anubhav-sinhas-film-nears-rs-5-cr-in-4-days-1401001">Anubhav Sinha</a>, met with majorly positive reception, it still couldn't post the kind of growth it needed in its first week. The movie should now aim to record a big jump in its second weekend in order to reach a respectable figure. However, it won't get a clear run as The Kerala Story is releasing in cinemas this weekend. Though it isn't a trouble as of now but you never know how such movies can take a sensational route, eventually becoming a threat like its predeccesor. </p>

<p>Co-starring Kani Kusruti, Revathy, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannus-courtroom-drama-records-muted-drop-collects-rs-45-lakh-on-day-6-1401064">Assi </a>had a lowkey promotional strategy, which is why it couldn't ignite the interest among the audience. All eyes are now on its second weekend hold. </p>

<p>The previous collaboration between Anubhav Sinha and Taapsee Pannu was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Assi Box Office Collections: Taapsee Pannu's courtroom drama records muted drop, collects Rs 45 lakh on Day 6','1401064','https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannus-courtroom-drama-records-muted-drop-collects-rs-45-lakh-on-day-6-1401064','Thappad','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Thappad</a>, which debuted with Rs. 2.75 crore and went on to collect Rs. 13.50 crore nett in its opening weekend. Thappad eventually recovered its cost of production and ended its theatrical run around Rs. 30 crore nett, which would be considered as a good outcome for a film like this in today's scenario. It will be interesting to see how Assi performs further. </p>

Though the drop isn&#39;t big but it is coming from an already low figure, so that doesn&#39;t make any cut. Estimates suggest that the movie collected Rs. 45 lakh on Day 6, bringing the cume to Rs. 5.60 crore nett at the Indian box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Co-starring&nbsp;Kani Kusruti, Revathy, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, the courtroom drama will face <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-dhurandhar-the-revenge-final-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-1401024">The Kerala Story 2</a> from the coming weekend. Since the movie has recieved a favourable word-of-mouth, it should see a spike on the second weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the major factors why the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-drops-on-day-3-wraps-opening-weekend-at-rs-4-10-crore-1400969">Taapsee Pannu</a> film isn&#39;t gaining the required traction is lack of interest among the audience. The movie had lowkey promotions, which also affected its box office potential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, audience now has a notion of considering such films as OTT movies, as they have now build enough patience to wait for movies&#39; digital release. The stakeholders needs to disrupt this patience and elongate the OTT window to somewhere around 6 months, otherwise the business of such small/mid-sized film is already dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The previous collaboration between Anubhav Sinha and Taapsee Pannu was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Assi Box Office Collections: Taapsee Pannu starrer drops on Day 3, wraps opening weekend at Rs 4.10 crore ','1400969','https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-drops-on-day-3-wraps-opening-weekend-at-rs-4-10-crore-1400969','Thappad','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Thappad</a>, which debuted with Rs. 2.75&nbsp;crore and went on to collect Rs. 13.50&nbsp;crore nett in its opening weekend. Thappad eventually recovered its cost of production and ended its theatrical run around Rs. 30 crore nett, which would be considered as a good outcome for a film like this in today&#39;s scenario.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein&nbsp;is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-film-continues-decent-run-nets-1-75cr-on-2nd-friday-1400535">Mardaani 3</a> has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates. </p>

The Jaspal Singh Sandhu directorial debuted with Rs. 50 lakh on Day 1 and went on to collect around Rs. 3.05 crore in its opening week. Furthermore, the movie witnessed a massive drop in the second week, when it minted just Rs. 25 lakh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Since then, it only could add around Rs. 5 lakh more to the tally, bringing its entire cume to Rs. 3.35 crore nett (Rs. 4 crore gross) at the Indian box office. Considering the cast, budget, and scale of the movie, Vadh 2 performed well. However, it should have recorded a much better theatrical run, if the movie had received audience support and better showcasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The original film had collected just Rs. 65 lakh in its entire run. Compared to which, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/vadh-2-box-office-collections-week-2-sanjay-mishra-neena-gupta-film-adds-rs-25-lakh-targets-rs-3-50-cr-finish-1400923">Vadh 2</a> managed to smash 5 times more. However, the sequel ran in cinemas with an activated Buy-One-Get-One offer, which means the actual earnings will be on the lower side.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Co-starring Kumud Mishra, Amitt Singh, Shilpa Shukla, and others, the crime thriller was released alongwith <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bhabhi-ji-ghar-par-hain-final-box-office-collections-aasif-sheikh-and-rohitashv-gour-starrer-ends-theatrical-run-at-rs-1-50-crore-turns-a-disaster-1400831">Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hain! Fun On The Roll</a> in cinemas. Though the comedy drama had a strong TV IP attached to it, still Vadh 2 performed far better. This is a win of sorts for the film and deserves acknowledgement. However, some sections of the trade seem unwilling to recognise the value in such results.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">One portal even states that &ldquo;the second part shouldn&rsquo;t really be happening.&rdquo; A film with no face value has done more than five times the business of its predecessor, albeit at a low level of business, which clearly indicates some appreciation. Dismissing its existence outright is myopic. Moreover, at a time when the industry routinely struggles with a lack of releases for several weeks in a year, discouraging films that are at least finding some audience is counterproductive. Beyond box office mathematics, filmmaking is fundamentally an art form, and the idea of suppressing films solely because they do not cater to mass audiences is deeply flawed.</p>

<p>Backed by JP Films and T-Series Films, the military action drama is now running in its final legs at the ticket window.

<p>The Sunny Deol starrer performed well on weekends but remained ordinary on the weekdays, which is why, it is ending its entire run far behind Deol&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/decoding-the-economics-of-gadar-2-sunny-deol-starrer-budget-recovery-verdict-and-lifetime-box-office-1244895">Gadar 2</a>.

As per estimates, the movie collected Rs. 1 crore yesterday, bringing the second week&#39;s cume to Rs. 11 crore in 6 days. It is looking to close this week at Rs. 12 crore, which will take its running cume of 14-days closer to Rs. 55 crore nett mark.</p>

<p>Based on the current trends, the romantic action drama is heading to wind its entire theatrical run somewhere around Rs. 60 crore or so. This isn&#39;t a good total for such a big-budgeted movie, thus, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/oromeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-and-tripti-dimri-starrer-collects-rs-1-25-crore-on-2nd-tuesday-cume-hits-rs-52-crore-in-12-days-1401032">O&#39;Romeo</a>&nbsp;is heading towards a disappointing end.</p>

<p>Not that it changes anything for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-triptii-dimri-film-makes-it-past-rs-50-cr-net-in-india-1401002">Shahid Kapoor</a> starrer, just that, at one point, even reaching Rs. 50 crore nett felt like an improbable task, but aided by BOGO offers and this open run, it has gotten there and some more. The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

As the duo steps into a committed relationship, there was a time a couple of years ago when their relationship was almost revealed by Ranbir Kapoor.</p>

<p><strong>When Ranbir Kapoor almost spilled the relationship between Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna</strong></p>

<p>In an episode of Unstoppable with NBK, hosted by Nandamuri Balakrishna, the Animal leads, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-ranbir-kapoors-valentines-tease-has-internet-guessing-about-his-one-wish-1400721">Ranbir Kapoor</a> and Rashmika Mandanna, appeared to promote the film along with director Sandeep Reddy Vanga.</p>

<p>During the show, the topic shifted to Arjun Reddy, and NBK asked Rashmika whether she had any connection to the film. In response, the actress did not elaborate on her personal life and instead mentioned that it was the first film she watched after moving to Hyderabad.</p>

<p>However, Ranbir Kapoor added more spice to the conversation, saying, &ldquo;There is a coincidence here. Sandeep met Rashmika for the first time at the Arjun Reddy success party, on Vijay&rsquo;s terrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the studio erupted in cheers, Rashmika responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary to give all this information.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Wedding of VIROSH</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/virosh-wedding-vijay-deverakonda-rashmika-mandannas-muhurtam-time-for-multi-cultural-wedding-revealed-1401050">Vijay Deverakonda</a> and Rashmika Mandanna are all set to tie the knot soon and were recently spotted arriving in Udaipur.

<p>Ahead of their wedding, the couple also held a haldi ceremony, which was teased by both Vijay and Rashmika. As part of the celebrations, a post featured an adorable picture of Vijay&rsquo;s Siberian Husky, Storm, and Rashmika&rsquo;s Cocker Spaniel, Aura.</p>

<p>As per reports, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-vijay-deverakondas-nickname-for-rashmika-mandanna-revealed-in-sneak-peek-at-fun-haldi-ceremony-1401051">Rashmika</a> and Vijay are set to enter wedlock at the auspicious muhurat time of 8 a.m. The couple will reportedly honor both their roots by hosting two traditional wedding ceremonies, a Telugu-style wedding and a Coorg-style wedding.</p>

They are set to return to the silver screen with a highly anticipated horror-comedy project that promises to revive their signature cinematic magic.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Scenes: How the Bhooth Bangla title was finalized by Akshay Kumar</strong></p>

<p>The collaboration was initiated by powerhouse producer Ektaa Kapoor, who personally pitched the script to the duo. Veteran director Priyadarshan immediately saw the story&rsquo;s potential and agreed to come on board after adding a few creative tweaks to the narrative.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-did-arshad-warsi-confirm-akshay-kumars-role-in-golmaal-5-actor-reveals-plans-for-asur-season-3-1400947">Akshay Kumar</a> who made the final call on the film&rsquo;s title, opting to change the original working title to the catchier Bhooth Bangla.</p>

<p>Promising a masterful blend of laugh-out-loud comedy, spine-tingling horror, and gripping thrills, the film is deliberately designed to remind fans of their 2007 cult classic, Bhool Bhulaiyaa. A recently released teaser perfectly captures this energetic vibe, showcasing Akshay Kumar having an absolute blast while navigating the spooky, chaotic antics of a haunted house.</p>

<p><strong>Ektaa Kapoor&#39;s Vision: A &quot;Wild Gujarati Thali&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/heer-ranjha-imtiaz-ali-reunites-with-ektaa-kapoor-for-new-film-expands-laila-majnu-franchise-1400756">Ektaa Kapoor</a>&nbsp;has a specific demographic in mind for this venture: families and children. Drawing personal inspiration from her own child, she wants the film to be an entertaining, shared experience for audiences of all ages. In an informal chat, she enthusiastically described Bhooth Bangla as a &ldquo;wild Gujarati thali&rdquo;&mdash;a rich, vibrant, and varied mix of comedy, horror, and drama that proudly features the &ldquo;OG&rdquo; masters of the genre.</p>

<p>With an ensemble cast that includes Paresh Rawal, Asrani, Rajpal Yadav, Tabu, Mithila Palkar, and Wamiqa Gabbi, Bhooth Bangla is shaping up to be a wild ride. Pritam&rsquo;s music is set to elevate the film&rsquo;s energy.</p>

<p>The first single from the film, titled Ram Ji Aake Bhala Karenge, has already been announced. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bhooth-bangla-akshay-kumar-vidya-balan-send-special-wishes-to-priyadarshan-for-the-film-as-he-turns-69-video-1400330">Bhooth Bangla</a> is officially slated to release in theatres on April 10, 2026.</p>

<p>Varun Tej Konidela previously starred in the lead role in the film Matka. Directed by Karuna Kumar, the period action drama is set between 1934 and 1988 in Visakhapatnam and is based on real-life incidents.</p>

The couple is happy with the term Virosh that fans coined for them, and have named their marriage ceremony as &ldquo;The Wedding of Virosh.&rdquo; As celebrations inch closer, admirers have been revisiting old interviews, photos, and videos that trace their journey from co-stars to life partners. Among the most talked-about resurfaced clips is one featuring Vijay&rsquo;s parents, whose heartfelt words about their future daughter-in-law have struck a chord online.<br />
<br />
<strong>Vijay Deverakonda&#39;s parents on their condition for to-be daughter-in-law</strong><br />
<br />
In 2018, during the success meet of Geetha Govindam, the host asked Vijay&rsquo;s parents, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-peek-into-rashmika-mandannas-future-home-vijay-deverakondas-luxurious-rs-15-crore-mansion-in-hyderabad-1401034">Govardhan Rao and Madhavi</a>, about their expectations for their son&rsquo;s marriage. Madhavi shared that she wished for someone who would genuinely love and care for Vijay and understand the demanding nature of his profession in the film industry. Echoing her sentiments, Govardhan Rao said that he wanted his son to marry the person of his choice, irrespective of caste or religion. He added that he would be happy if Vijay married an Indian, preferably a South Indian. Vijay, present at the event, had lightened the moment by reiterating his belief in love marriage, joking that while the choice would be his, his parents would also need to adore the girl.</p>

<p>Over the years, fans closely followed Vijay and Rashmika&rsquo;s bond, strengthened through films like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/virosh-wedding-vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandannas-sangeet-dance-to-have-a-geetha-govindam-link-find-out-1401042">Geetha Govindam</a> and Dear Comrade. During promotions for The Girlfriend, Rashmika hinted at having a partner who helped her heal from past pain, sparking speculation that she was referring to Vijay. Reports later suggested the couple got engaged privately in Hyderabad last October, long before they made their relationship public.<br />

While the couple has been tight-lipped about the celebrations, tiny details are being shared online regarding the nuptials.

The couple that finally announced their relationship alongside their wedding plans for this week showcased a glimpse at their intimate affairs with minimal updates on their Instagram handles. A report from India Today has now claimed that the Animal actress will be gifted a family treasure at their sangeet ceremony.</p>

<p><strong>Rashmika Mandanna gets a grand family welcome from Vijay Deverakonda&rsquo;s mom</strong></p>

<p>A source spoke about Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna&#39;s wedding festivities, sharing how the actor&rsquo;s mother, Deverakonda Madhavi, planned on presenting a set of meaningful jewellery to her would-be daughter-in-law. &ldquo;In a heartfelt gesture, Vijay&rsquo;s mother will present Rashmika with traditional heirloom bangles during the sangeet ceremony, symbolising acceptance, love and family legacy,&rdquo; was reportedly said about the couple&rsquo;s celebrations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the couple, the guests, and their families gear up for the ceremony at the ITC Mementos hotel, Udaipur, fans have been cheering on for the pair loudly. The duo was rumored to be in a relationship for many years before finally confirming it earlier on Sunday. They have been sharing tiny sneak peeks of the celebrations on their social media accounts, including a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/virosh-wedding-vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandanna-indulge-in-fun-cricket-match-before-tying-the-knot-1401022">cricket match</a> moment following <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-rashmika-mandanna-vijay-deverakonda-kickoff-wedding-festivities-with-celebratory-dinner-and-water-volleyball-pics-1401003">water volleyball and a welcome dinner</a> with indulgent Japanese cuisine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna are all set to marry in a private affair on February 26, 2026, in Udaipur, with a limited guestlist. Meanwhile, a separate reception will be held back home for their industry colleagues and friends back home in Hyderabad on March 4.</p>

<p>Following their work in Geetha Govindam back in 2018, the couple reunited for Dear Comrade in 2019, and the dating rumors have followed them since. They were spotted going on a vacation to Rome earlier this year and have announced their official couple name as Virosh.</p>

The drop is very disappointing as the movie should have record a spike ideally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The courtroom drama collected Rs. 50 lakh on its Day 5, bringing its total cume to Rs. 5.15 crore nett at the Indian box office. It is expected to wind its first week around Rs. 6 crore nett or so. The way Assi is performing, it&#39;s nothing but disappointing. Since the movie has received mainly positive word-of-mouth, it still didn&#39;t see any sort of growth at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the movie continues with the same pace, it will only tank at the box office, emerging another failure this year. One of the major reasons why <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-and-anubhav-sinhas-film-nears-rs-5-cr-in-4-days-1401001">Assi </a>isn&#39;t picking up is the lack of awareness around its release, as the promotional strategy was very lukewarm.</p>

<p>Furthermore, audience now has a notion of considering such films as OTT movies, as they have now build enough patience to wait for movies&#39; digital release. The stakeholders needs to disrupt this patience and elongate the OTT window to somewhere around 6 months, otherwise the business of such small/mid-sized film is already dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how far the latest <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/taapsee-pannu-gets-real-about-the-negative-side-of-pr-you-pay-to-push-yourself-and-to-push-someone-else-down-1399860">Taapsee Pannu</a> film can go at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

It will be a good outcome for the film as the theatrical business has gone down drastically in the post-pandemic era, with the rise of OTT in India.</p>

<p>In fact, big-budget movies starring A-listers are also struggling to find the audience. In such times, if a female-led film managed to recover its cost of production, its a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The military action drama collected Rs. 30 lakh on its 5th Tuesday, registering a nominal jump over the previous day. The 5th week's cume has now reached Rs. 2.80 crore nett, which took its 37-day cume to slightly over the Rs. 305 crore nett at the Indian box office. </p>

<p>Allied to its Rs. 42 crore of first week, the total cume of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-triptii-dimri-film-makes-it-past-rs-50-cr-net-in-india-1401002">O&#39;Romeo</a> reached Rs. 52 crore nett in its 12 days of theatrical run.

<p>Based on the current trends, the Vishal Bharadwaj directorial is heading to wind its entire theatrical run around Rs. 60 crore nett at the Indian box office, which is not a good total for such a well-budgeted movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not that it changes anything for the film, just that, at one point, even reaching Rs. 50 crore nett felt like an improbable task, but aided by BOGO offers and this open run, it has gotten there and some more. The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Entering the Pinkvilla Predicts tracking this week is the highly anticipated Dhurandhar: The Revenge. This also marks the final update for The Kerala Story 2: Goes Beyond.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dhurandhar: The Revenge (19/03/2026)</strong><br />
First Day Box Office Forecast: Rs. 67-77 crore</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dhurandhar: The Revenge or Dhurandhar 2 is the most anticipated Bollywood film in recent times, probably since Dhoom 3. The original <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/decoding-economics-of-dhurandhar-ranveer-singh-film-generates-300-crore-profits-1400454">Dhurandhar</a>, released in December 2025, was a <em>box office dhurandhar</em>, which had a glorious run and went on to become the biggest Hindi film of all time. It has continued its record-breaking journey beyond theatrically as well, amassing record views for an Indian film on Netflix.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The film has no fresh marketing material out yet, but it doesn&rsquo;t even really matter, as the first part itself was a trailer for it. It could practically release tomorrow and will still open to historic numbers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The record for the highest opening day for a Hindi film is held by Jawan at Rs. 64 crore nett. Releasing on Eid holiday, Dhurandhar 2 would comfortably cross that and will set new benchmarks for the Hindi film industry. Had it been a solo release, it would be expected to clear Rs. 70 crore nett and Rs. 80 crore nett mark, possibly even Rs. 90 crore nett, but that is unfortunately not the case as the film is slated to clash with Yash starrer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-toxic-hindi-trailer-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-final-update-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-1400833">Toxic</a>, which will cause a loss of capacity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If it were a solo release, the forecast for the film would have been around Rs. 80-90 crore, but considering the clash, it is starting at Rs. 67-77 crore. In this range, the scope for upside is more, with the pinpoint forecast closer to the higher end. With more clarity on showcasing, as we get closer to release, the forecast may be increased.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Updates</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Kerala Story 2</strong> remains a tricky title to predict for all the factors explained previously. The forecast remains unchanged at Rs. 3-7 crore.&nbsp;</p>

The drop from Sunday is about 40 percent, which means, the movie is holding decently. The 4th week&#39;s cume now stands at Rs. 1.60 crore in 4 days and it is expected to wind around 2.50 crore or so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backed by Yash Raj Films, the cop action drama has reached Rs. 47 crore in 29 days of its theatrical run. Mardaani 3 is now taking its last few breaths at the box office and is looking to wind its entire theatrical run around Rs. 50 crore nett mark, which will be a good total for a female-led film in the post-COVID times, when the theatrical business has gone down drastically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mardaani 3 is now the biggest grosser of its franchise, surpassing Mardaani 2&#39;s Rs. 46.30 crore of lifetime earnings. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-says-salman-khan-got-heart-of-gold-credits-khan-trio-for-her-bollywood-journey-1400317">Rani Mukerji</a> starrer also emerged as the only successful female-led franchise from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-india-box-office-collections-4th-weekend-rani-mukerjis-cop-drama-emerges-franchises-biggest-grosser-surpasses-mardaani-2-1400982">Mardaani 3</a>&nbsp;has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

<p>Vijay continued, &ldquo;I want to make sure he remains alive even while working with Mani Ratnam. When I entered the industry, all I wanted was to stand in front of the camera and deliver my dialogue. Even today, I feel so alive when I&rsquo;m in front of the camera.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While more details about the project haven&rsquo;t been revealed, reports suggest that it will be a romantic film.</p>

Their return signals more than nostalgia; it restores the emotional core that has shaped the slasher saga for decades. As Sidney Prescott and Gale Weathers, the duo has anchored the series through shifting timelines, rising body counts, and evolving horror tropes. It is a powerful continuation of one of horror&rsquo;s most iconic female dynamics.<br />
<br />
<strong>Courteney Cox and&nbsp;Neve Campbell reunite for Scream 7</strong><br />
<br />
For Courteney Cox, stepping back into Gale&rsquo;s shoes alongside Campbell felt instinctive. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long, it seems like we grew up together. Gale and Sidney will always have some issues, but working together is the most comfortable thing in the world for us. It&rsquo;s the way it should be,&rdquo; she said. Their off-screen familiarity continues to fuel the layered tension and loyalty that defines their on-screen characters.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/6-hollywood-theatrical-releases-this-week-feb-23-28-2026-from-scream-7-to-epic-elvis-presley-in-concert-1400988?amp">Neve Campbell</a> echoed&nbsp;the sentiment, reflecting on how the characters&rsquo; bond has matured. &ldquo;Their love-hate relationship has always been a lot of fun. We get to see more of that this time as they become even closer. Gale brings so much humor to these films and Courteney adds an important layer of humanity to her,&rdquo; she said. The evolving camaraderie promises emotional depth amid the terror.<br />
<br />
<strong>About the film Scream 7</strong><br />
<br />
Scream 7 is helmed by Kevin Williamson, who also worked on the screenplay of the film. With legacy characters reclaiming the spotlight, Scream 7 aims to balance suspense, wit, and character-driven storytelling. Paramount Pictures India will release the film in cinemas on February 27, 2026.</p>

Even the smallest of updates are grabbing the audience&rsquo;s attention, and the latest buzz seems to be about the upcoming filming schedule of the film. As reported on February 24, the stars of the SS Rajamouli movie have proceeded to Georgia, where they will shoot &lsquo;crucial&rsquo; sequences as per Gulte. A separate report by Deccan Chronicle has claimed that the director will aim for action scenes between the protagonist and antagonist.</p>

<p><strong>Varanasi begins Georgia filming schedule</strong></p>

<p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, superstar Mahesh Babu was spotted flying to Georgia as previously rumored. The actor&rsquo;s team accompanied him at the airport as he headed for the next filming location, Georgia. It has been reported that the filmmaker, alongside DOP PS Vinod, previously scouted and fixed the venues for the shoot a couple of months ago, and will now be taking the actors there for a span of 12 to 14 days.</p>

<p>The makers are seemingly aiming to shoot crucial portions of the film during these two weeks. Buzz has claimed that &lsquo;massive action sequences and pivotal scenes&rsquo; starring Mahesh Babu and Prithviraj Sukumaran will be shot during this time. It is not known whether the lead actress, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-priyanka-chopra-jonas-calls-mahesh-babu-starrer-a-career-defining-film-says-ss-rajamouli-is-the-best-in-india-1400872">Priyanka Chopra</a>, will be joining the crew during this leg of the shoot; however, it seems unlikely with her ongoing promotions for The Bluff and the schedule focusing on the two male leads&rsquo; portions.</p>

<p>Helmed by SS Rajamouli, Mahesh Babu will play Rudhra in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/its-official-mahesh-babu-starrer-varanasi-with-ss-rajamouli-to-hit-big-screens-on-april-7-2027-new-look-out-1400342">Varanasi</a>, with some reports suggesting a dual role as Lord Rama or an inspiration angle. Meanwhile, Kumbha will be Prithviraj Sukumaran&rsquo;s wheelchair-bound character. Priyanka Chopra has been roped in for the role of Mandakini.</p>

<p>Varanasi is expected to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-update-ss-rajamouli-confirms-mahesh-babus-movie-to-wrap-up-shoot-by-june-2026-1400722">wrap filming by June</a>&nbsp;this year and then focus on the post-production work, including enormous VFX editing and more. The film has already announced its April 7, 2027, release date and previously held a big title reveal event at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.</p>

<p>On February 23, 2026, local time, it was confirmed that Robert Carradine passed away via a note from his family to Deadline. The actor was known for his work in projects like The Long Riders, Revenge of the Nerds, and most prominently, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/10-actresses-who-made-powerful-comebacks-after-break-from-drew-barrymore-to-jennifer-lopez-1389848">Lizzie McGuire</a>. His demise has invited tributes from fellow co-stars and many who crossed paths with him during his long career.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robert Carradine passes away, family note confirms</strong></p>

<p>The family of the star shared the confirmation as follows, &ldquo;It is with profound sadness that we must share that our beloved father, grandfather, uncle, and brother Robert Carradine has passed away. In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon on light to everyone around him. We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby&rsquo;s valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with Bipolar Disorder. We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness. At this time we ask for the privacy to grieve this unfathomable loss. With gratitude for your understanding and compassion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, his on-screen daughter, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/hilary-duff-plastic-surgery-1251030">Hilary Duff</a>, who played the titular character on Lizzie McGuire,&nbsp;took to her social media to share her sorrow, &ldquo;This one hurts. It&rsquo;s really hard to face this reality about an old friend. There was so much warmth in the McGuire family ,and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. I&rsquo;ll be forever grateful for that. I&rsquo;m deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other actors on the show also remembered the late star for his talent. &ldquo;My heart hurts today. I was fortunate to know Bobby for most of my life. And he was one of the coolest guys you could ever meet. Funny, pragmatic, sometimes cranky, always a little eccentric,&rdquo; said Jake Thomas. He recalled their fond memories on the set and praised his acting, music, and directing skills.</p>

<p>Lalaine, who played Miranda Sanchez, spoke about how unfair it was, &ldquo;I am thankful tho. (though) Thankful I had time with you, thankful for our last conversation, and your constant fatherly like support. I love you Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kalki-2898-ad-sequel-deepika-padukone-out-sai-pallavi-in-for-prabhas-nag-ashwins-film-1400425">Kalki 2898 AD</a> begins at the end of the Mahabharata&rsquo;s Kurukshetra War, marking the onset of the Kali Yuga in 3102 BC. After the war, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna with the responsibility of protecting Lord Vishnu&rsquo;s final avatar when the time comes.</p>

<p>Six thousand years later, in 2898 AD, the world has transformed into a harsh dystopia ruled through fear by a self-proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to appease him in hopes of gaining access to his abundant land, known as the Complex, others rise in rebellion against his tyranny.</p>

<p>As hope begins to fade, a new light emerges in the form of an unborn child carried by SUM-80, also known as Sumathi. With Yaskin and his followers determined to extract the child&rsquo;s life force, an epic tale unfolds, setting the stage for the rest of the saga.</p>

<p>The first installment starred <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-on-how-he-wishes-to-do-more-films-for-fans-but-only-2-will-be-arriving-this-year-3-movies-were-to-release-1400932">Prabhas</a> in the lead role and also featured Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, and Kamal Haasan in prominent roles. As Deepika has reportedly opted out of the project, rumors suggest that Sai Pallavi may replace her in the sequel.</p>

<p>While Prabhas is currently working on Fauzi and Spirit, he is expected to join the shoot of Kalki 2 later.</p>

After months of speculation around their relationship, secret engagement, and upcoming nuptials, the two finally confirmed that they&rsquo;ll be getting married via a note to their fans. Announcing the &lsquo;Wedding of VIROSH,&rsquo; the couple is gearing up to tie the knot on February 26, 2026. Ahead of the big day, we&rsquo;re taking a look at the details of where it all first began.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong><br />
The duo&rsquo;s first known meeting was for the 2018 film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-rashmika-mandanna-cried-while-filming-geetha-govindam-with-vijay-deverakonda-for-this-reason-1339681">Geetha Govindam</a>. They began shooting for the same back in 2017, shortly after the actress called off her engagement to Rakshit Shetty. In the project, they starred as Vijay Govind and Geetha Kanuganti, who quickly became fan favorites for their chemistry, which led to a commercially successful run at the box office.</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong><br />
The following year, they were cast in another movie together, a rarity owing to the close timelines of both projects. But their on and offscreen sparks could not be ignored, and thus came <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/vijay-deverakonda-rashmika-mandannas-dear-comrade-plans-hindi-remake-siddhant-chaturvedi-pratibha-ranta-eyed-as-leads-1399576">Dear Comrade</a>, which essentially became the foundation of their dating phase. Rumors followed the couple no matter where they went and allowed them to test the waters with their fans, who were loving even the tiniest of their interactions.</p>

<p><strong>2020-2022</strong><br />
Secret dates and vacations became the norm for the couple. Their fans spotted them on multiple occasions, with the same backgrounds in photos and dinner sightings. However, the couple was tight-lipped and not ready to comment on it publicly, side-stepping all rumors and questions alike. They maintained that they were friends only, with Rashmika even saying that she was too early in her career for anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong><br />
During Animal promotions, she was asked to call up Vijay Deverakonda with co-star Ranbir Kapoor by her side. Answering her sudden call, the actor said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up re?,&rdquo; causing an uproar in the fandom for his casual tone. The actress blushed, informed him that they were on loud speaker, and the fans were convinced that the sparks were more than just that.</p>

<p><strong>2024</strong><br />
While never publicly confirming their rumors, the two hinted at being in a relationship. They did not reveal the names of their partners but continued to support each other&rsquo;s projects and drop subtle clues, becoming more open with their relationship.</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong><br />
Reports of the two having gotten engaged at the Kingdom actor&rsquo;s home in Hyderabad surfaced. It was said that an intimate ceremony was held in the presence of their families on October 3, 2025, with Rashmika being spotted with a new sparkler on her ring finger later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an appearance for The Girlfriend, amid ongoing success promotions, Vijay suddenly grabbed the hand of his lady love and dropped a sweet kiss, in his first public display of affection. The internet subsequently lost its mind and cheered for the two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple went on a Rome trip with their friends and featured in each other&rsquo;s social media updates, before which the actress jetted off to Sri Lanka for an apparent bachelorette party. This would be followed by them wrapping up their individual filming schedules, including Cocktail 2 for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rumors of a February wedding emerged with an invitation card revealing that the ceremony will be held in Udaipur with only close friends and family. It will be followed by a grand reception back home in Hyderabad for their colleagues and industry friends on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p>The couple finally announced their wedding to their fans amid heightened security around the venue, and is all set to tie the knot this Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Rashmika Mandanna and Vijay Deverakonda&rsquo;s pre-wedding rituals</strong></h3>

Yesterday (February 23, 2026), the couple hosted their friends and family to a celebratory luncheon and dinner. The groom-to-be also had a blast enjoying water volleyball with his best buds and probably the&nbsp;groomsmen.</p>

<p>After unwinding in the palace overlooking picturesque mountains and sa tunning sunset view, the couple is ready to step into wedlock. According to a report by India Today, their wedding will commence with an intimate daytime Mehendi ceremony. The ceremony will also include dance and music, with reports suggesting that several artists have been flown in to keep the guests entertained.</p>

<p>The same evening, a happening Sangeet is also expected to take place, giving the stars another chance to let their hair down and enjoy their last days as an engaged couple. The following day (February 25, 2026), a Haldi ceremony is on the cards, taking place at a spectacular outdoor location of the hotel.</p>

<p>The pre-wedding rituals will be held in the presence of only the dear and near ones of the couple. All the events will lead up to the main event, the wedding, which is going to be a blend of traditional and modern elements. Rumors have it that their traditional wedding ceremony will happen in the daytime on February 26, 2026, as customary.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

The drop from the second Friday is 35 per cent, which is good, but doesn&rsquo;t really count when the base is low enough to be called poor.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Shahid Kapoor and Triptii Dimri film has collected Rs. 8.75 crore nett approx in the first four days of its second week. The full second week will likely collect around Rs. 12 crore nett. There will be competition from The Kerala Story 2 next week, but then the following two weeks are open weeks, so it will likely continue to play in the cinemas till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-toxic-hindi-trailer-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-final-update-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-1400833">Toxic (Hindi)</a> arrive on March 19th. That could lead it to a Rs. 60 crore nett final.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Not that it changes anything for the film, just that, at one point, even reaching Rs. 50 crore nett felt like an improbable task, but aided by BOGO offers and this open run, it has gotten there and some more. The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The results are consistent with director Vishal Bhardwaj, who hasn&rsquo;t found much success at the box office in his career. His collaborations with Shahid Kapoor have done relatively better, namely Kaminey and Haider. Rangoon didn&rsquo;t do well, and now this one has also faltered.</p>

That marks a 35 per cent drop from its opening day, which is generally considered good but not at this level of collection, where you need to be on par with first day and even then it might not be enough. The four day running total stands at Rs. 4.75 crore nett approx.</p>

<p>The movie needs to keep maintaining the same momentum ahead and grow with mouth publicity since the word-of-mouth seems positive. Based on the current trends, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-drops-on-day-3-wraps-opening-weekend-at-rs-4-10-crore-1400969">Taapsee Pannu</a> starrer courtroom drama is looking to wind its opening week around Rs. 6.50 crore or so.&nbsp;</p>

However, that won&#39;t be easy as the movie still has low awareness among the audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The previous collaboration of Sinha and Taapsee was Thappad, which collected around Rs. 13 crore in its opening weekend and then went on to collect around Rs. 30 crore nett. This would be a good total for a film like this in today&#39;s times as theatrical business has gone down severely ever since OTT bloomed in India. It will be interesting to see how <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-records-60-percent-spike-on-day-2-nets-rs-2-60-crore-in-two-days-1400963">Assi </a>performs further at the box office and whether it can emerge as a successful story or not.&nbsp;</p>

While the announcement promo of the project created a massive uproar, it appears that the filmmaker has yet to provide a complete script to the Icon Star.</p>

<p><strong>Is Lokesh Kanagaraj yet to narrate the full script of AA23 to Allu Arjun?</strong></p>

<p>According to online buzz shared by Movies Singapore, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/lokesh-kanagaraj-films-ranked-worst-to-best-cinematic-ventures-directed-by-coolie-helmer-1390693">Lokesh Kanagaraj</a>&nbsp;narrated an outline of the film to the Pushpa actor, which reportedly impressed him. However, the full screenplay is yet to be completed and will be presented to the actor in a final narration once it is ready.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Lokesh is currently working on the bound script along with his co-writers Chandru Anbazhagan and Rathna Kumar, along with other key assistant directors. The filmmaker is presently in Kerala and is expected to continue working on the script until March 3, 2026.</p>

Following the phenomenal success of Mankatha this year, another Ajith Kumar&#39;s film, Thunivu returned to the cinemas, along with Thalapathy Vijay and Trisha Krishnan starrer Ghilli. The box office rivalry between the two superstars of Tamil cinema&nbsp;hasn&#39;t been any secret. Here&#39;s a look at how both Thunivu and Ghilli performed in their opening weekends.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/ghilli-re-release-box-office-collections-thalapathy-vijay-starrer-records-strong-start-grosses-rs-1-30-crore-in-two-days-1400964">Ghilli </a>debuted with Rs. 55 lakh at the box office and went on to collect a superb Rs. 1.95 crore in its opening weekend, of which around Rs. 1.70 crore came from Tamil Nadu alone, while the remaining&nbsp;Rs. 25 lakh came from the rest of India. In contrast, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/thunivu-box-office-collections-ajith-kumar-starrer-tops-rs-100-crores-in-india-1206605">Thunivu </a>opened with Rs. 18 lakh and went on to wrap its first weekend at Rs. 42 lakh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, the Thalapathy Vijay starrer film established a big lead of Rs. 1.53 crore gross over the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/after-viswasam-ajith-kumar-and-director-siva-to-reunite-for-5th-time-filmmaker-confirms-project-1400955">Ajith Kumar</a> film. However, one must note that Ghilli had an edge over showcasing. While Ghilli was&nbsp;released in around 250 screens in Tamil Nadu other than the rest of Indian markets, Thunivu&#39;s release was exclusive for its home state alone, where it had around 225 screens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how far both these movies can go from here on.&nbsp;</p>

The same has followed for her love story with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/first-pics-samantha-ruth-prabhu-and-raj-nidimoru-looking-stunning-as-husband-and-wife-netizens-comment-1398838">Raj Nidimoru</a>. But on the actress&rsquo;s end, much has changed, as she revealed during a chat with Vogue India, opening up about how she&rsquo;s a &lsquo;much better person&rsquo; due to her second marriage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Samantha Ruth Prabhu reveals how her new partner, Raj Nidimoru,&nbsp;has changed her life</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about how being in a public relationship with a big star and a subsequent split, the Eega actor did not know whether she could ever do it again. Sharing her admiration for her current husband, the actress said, &quot;When I went through a separation, I closed up completely. I didn&rsquo;t think it would ever be possible to rely on someone else. Thankfully, I was vulnerable enough to accept that kind of love and friendship. And I&rsquo;m a much better person because of the relationship I&rsquo;m in. Because of the person Raj (Nidimoru) is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 38-year-old has had a massive change in her personality following the divorce, and so has been noted by her own pals. She shared an anecdote about having met an old friend recently, who shared a voice note with the actress later, saying, &lsquo;This is the first time in a long time that I feel like you&rsquo;re not struggling to breathe.&rsquo; The star agreed, sharing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not performing anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Neethaane En Ponvasantham star dated the son of acting superstar Nagarjuna Akkineni, Naga Chaitanya, from 2010 to 2017. The two got married in Goa on October 6, 2017. However, the duo announced their split on October 2, 2021, after months of speculation. He then got married to actress Sobhita Dhulipala in 2024.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/samantha-ruth-prabhu-says-being-real-made-split-from-naga-chaitanya-public-lot-of-trolling-and-judgment-1397833">Samantha Ruth Prabhu</a>&nbsp;was later linked to the director Raj Nidimoru, with whom she worked on The Family Man Season 2, and is one-half of the filmmaker duo Raj &amp; DK. The two got married on December 1, 2025, via a Linga Bhairava Vivaha ceremony at the Isha Foundation in Coimbatore.</p>

Allied to its Rs. 4.25 crore cume of Week 1, the total earnings of the survival thriller has reached Rs. 5.25 crore in 10 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backed by Colour Yellow Productions and Bhanushali Studios, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/tu-yaa-main-box-office-collections-adarsh-gourav-and-shanaya-kapoor-starrer-continues-to-struggle-cume-nears-rs-5-crore-mark-1400962">Tu Yaa Main</a> didn&#39;t record the kind of growth it needed so far. The crocodile film is&nbsp;expected to crawl from today onwards on weekdays, with significant drops. Based on the current trends, the movie won&#39;t be able to survive much longer at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for now, it is looking to wind its entire theatrical run under the Rs. 10 crore nett mark at the domestic box office. Though the movie received a slightly better reception than its rival release, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-triptii-dimri-film-has-a-poor-second-weekend-nears-rs-50-cr-in-10-days-1400972">O&#39;Romeo</a>, it still failed to show any sort of growth in the ticket sales. Sadly, audience now considers such movies as OTT films, which is why they don&#39;t bother to go to cinemas and watch such films.&nbsp;The makers need to elongate the 8-week OTT window to somewhere around 6 months to save the dying business of such small/mid-budgeted films.&nbsp;</p>

The running cume of Mardaani 3 now stands at Rs. 46.70 crore nett at the Indian box office. It emerged as the biggest net grosser of the franchise, surpassing Mardaani 2&#39;s lifetime cume of Rs. 46.30 crore on its 4th Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-recalls-national-award-win-alongside-shah-rukh-khan-hum-dono-bachchon-ke-tarah-the-1400313">Rani Mukerji</a> starrer is now running in its final legs at the box office. Based on the current trends, the movie will end its entire run around Rs. 50 crore nett mark. It will be a good total for a female-led film&nbsp;in the post-pandemic times. Mardaani also emerged as the only successful female led franchise from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerjis-cop-drama-collects-rs-5-45-crore-in-3rd-week-cume-crosses-rs-45-crore-mark-1400891">Mardaani 3</a>&nbsp;has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

We would like to call it &lsquo;The Wedding of VIROSH.&rsquo; Thank you for holding us with so much love. You are a part of us, always. Biggest hugs and all our love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those unaware, Vijay and Rashmika first appeared together on the big screen in the film Geetha Govindam. Following the Parasuram directorial, the duo also appeared together in Dear Comrade, during which relationship rumors about them were rampant. Now, the couple is all set to tie the knot in an intimate ceremony on February 26, with a reception expected to take place in Hyderabad on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p>Though its a good total, the movie remained far behind Deol&#39;s last blockbuster, Gadar 2. Nevertheless, Border 2 emerged as a Clean Hit venture. At one point, even Super Hit or Blockbuster verdict seemed a possibility but the movie couldn&#39;t maintain the same momentum on weekdays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, Border 2 emerged as the first Hit film of 2026 from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;The movie&nbsp;has done better in northern circuits, where Rajasthan is closer to BLOCKBUSTER, while Delhi-UP and East Punjab have done SUPER HIT business.

Hosted by Alan Cumming, the 79th British Academy Film Awards was a star-studded affair with the biggest stars in attendance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the winners of the night, Paul Thomas Anderson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/one-battle-after-another-exclusive-leonardo-dicaprio-on-his-dream-collaboration-with-benicio-del-toro-and-their-camaraderie-1396785">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>-led&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-presents-value-for-money-hilarity-with-punch-in-the-gut-emotion-1397201">One Battle After Another</a> was the biggest earner with an impressive 6 grabs. Michael B. Jordan&rsquo;s Sinners followed with 3 of its own. Robert Aramayo, who led I Swear,&nbsp;was the most welcome surprise, winning the coveted Best Leading Actor award among some of the best contenders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the biggest shock remained Marty Supreme, which was given no trophies even after being in the running for a whopping 11. The Josh Safdie sports dramedy tied 1969 film Women in Love and 2004&rsquo;s Finding Neverland in doing so. The latter two went on to nab one Oscar each, meaning all hope is not lost for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/timothee-chalamet-goes-instagram-official-with-kylie-jenner-after-dating-for-3-years-tremendously-grateful-1399867">Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet</a> starrer, which did get big wins at Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes.</p>

The domestic and overseas split for the film stands at Rs. 2.40 crore (Rs. 2 crore nett) and Rs. 6.10 crore (USD 675K) respectively. Compared to the other recent Ammy Virk films, the opening weekend is below Saunkan Saunkanay 2 (Rs. 15 crore) and Sarbala (Rs. 11.25 crore).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The overseas performance ranges from so-so to good. The good being Canada, which was on par with Sarbala and better than Saunkan Saunkanay 2. Had Canada not delivered, it would have been a total lost cause, but now Canada has given it some numbers to go with.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The main disappointment came in India, where the film has not done well. The original Bambukat was a blockbuster in 2016, which opened to bumper numbers and then trended superbly. Considering how comedy sequels do well, one would have expected triple the numbers it has done. The trend over the weekend is also quite mediocre, with Sunday not growing as much as it could have.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Box Office Collections of Bambukat 2 in India is as follows:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjabi film box office in India has fallen off from the highs of the 2010s, when the business was growing and sort of peaked towards the end of the decade. The quality of films aside, one of the major driving factors is demographic change. A sustained wave of emigration in the late 2010s and early 2020s has reshaped the core audience base. A large chunk of the business has shifted from India to overseas markets like Canada and Australia. It is now common for overseas collections to be multiple times higher than those in India. In contrast, pre-COVID, the business used to be more domestic-heavy, with rarely any film collecting more overseas than in India.</p>

The couple that has been going out for a while now, made sure the world knew they were together in an undeniable PDA moment at the award ceremony. With a cheek kiss, the That&#39;s So True singer sealed it in for her boyfriend, who she came in to support for how work with Hamnet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re taking a look at the couple&rsquo;s journey from strangers to lovers.</p>

<p><strong>June 2024: First spotting</strong><br />
Just weeks after fans began connecting the dots about the two being in cahoots, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/isnt-that-devastating-gladiator-ii-star-paul-mescal-reveals-how-untrue-rumors-of-one-night-stands-affected-his-mom-1353648">Paul Mescal</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/happy-birthday-gracie-abrams-top-10-songs-to-listen-to-as-singer-turns-25-1345849">Gracie Abrams</a> were spotted by TMZ, with him reaching out to cup her face at a food outing. Prior to this, many even speculated that she had given a nod to the actor&rsquo;s Normal People role in her song Normal Thing, writing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal thing to fall in love with movie stars. When the lights are low, and red at all their favorite bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They continued to be spotted together, including a Mayfair shopping outing and other small dates around. They&rsquo;re called to be like &lsquo;any other young couple&rsquo; by a source speaking to The Sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>August 2024: London kisses</strong><br />
The two were once again photographed by paparazzi but this time in a manner that almost confirmed their romance. Daily Mail shared snaps of them holding hands while in London, with an onlooker claiming they were &lsquo;kissing a lot.&rsquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been hooking up and it&rsquo;s still early stages,&rdquo; a source then said to PEOPLE.</p>

<p><strong>September 2024: Public dating</strong><br />
The two finally decided to go public with a stroll hand-in-hand. A laid-back date, their outing was a clear declaration of the new romance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>October 2024: Eras Tour&nbsp;</strong><br />
Paul Mescal was there to support his girlfriend, Gracie Abrams, as she opened for Taylor Swift at the Eras Tour in Miami, where he interacted with fellow concertgoers from a VIP section of the crowd. Many casual dates across the country followed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>November 2024: Party people</strong><br />
The duo attended the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-when-paul-mescal-claimed-hed-be-in-a-bad-spot-if-gladiator-2-makes-him-a-household-name-more-people-will-stop-you-1362267">Gladiator II</a> premiere after-party together and made their first work-related appearance beside each other. Their coordinated knit outfits only added to the charm. He then supported her once again at the Saturday Night Live after party the following month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>February 2025: High bars</strong><br />
Gracie Abrams spoke about having a high bar in her relationships while speaking to Cosmopolitan. She did not mention her beau by name but hinted at how their dating phase was going with, &ldquo;My current form of love feels like home no matter where I am,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s literally nothing better than being with somebody where you&rsquo;re not putting on a performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>May 2025: Reverse support</strong><br />
The History of Sound premiere at the Cannes Film Festival saw the American star make an appearance for her man, still not making it a couple&rsquo;s outing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>June 2025: Festival date and going Instagram official&nbsp;</strong><br />
The duo was spotted enjoying Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s set, and she made it semi-Instagram official with a clip of her sitting on his shoulders as the singer belted The Cure&rsquo;s Friday I&rsquo;m In Love. Soon after, they were official on social media as she shared photos from their day out with friends at the music festival and captioned it with all hearts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>January 2026: Surprise confessions</strong><br />
During Hamnet promotions, Gracie Abrams shared a photo of her partner, who plays William Shakespeare in the film, and wrote, &ldquo;Also I love him surprise.&rdquo; She praised his co-stars in an emotional update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid more support for each other&rsquo;s projects and mushy birthday messages, their latest red carpet official moment is all everyone can talk about!</p>

This brings the total cume of Assi to Rs. 4.10 crore nett at the Indian box office in its opening weekend. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The movie needs to show strong trends ahead on weekdays and then on the second weekend in order to have a chance at the box office. So far the word-of-mouth is positive, however, the movie isn't getting the kind of audience support it need. That may be due to lack of awareness among the audience around its release and then the lowkey marketing strategy. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/assi-twitter-review-11-tweets-to-read-before-watching-taapsee-pannu-in-anubhav-sinhas-courtroom-drama-1400924" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Assi Box Office Collections: Taapsee Pannu starrer records 60 percent spike on Day 2, nets Rs 2.60 crore in two days ','1400963','https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/assi-twitter-review-11-tweets-to-read-before-watching-taapsee-pannu-in-anubhav-sinhas-courtroom-drama-1400924','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-records-60-percent-spike-on-day-2-nets-rs-2-60-crore-in-two-days-1400963','Taapsee Pannu','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Taapsee Pannu</a>, Kani Kusruti, Revathy, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, the courtroom drama has a clean run until the release of Dhurandhar and Toxic (March 19), which means, it might have a chance if it manages to grow well further and stick to the cinemas for a long run. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The previous collaboration between Anubhav Sinha and Taapsee Pannu was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096">Thappad</a>, which debuted with Rs. 2.75 crore and went on to collect Rs. 13.50 crore nett in its opening weekend. Thappad eventually recovered its cost of production and ended its theatrical run around Rs. 30 crore nett, which would be considered as a good outcome for a film like this in today's scenario. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Compared to Thappad, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-records-60-percent-spike-on-day-2-nets-rs-2-60-crore-in-two-days-1400963">Assi </a>is nowhere closer. That's due to Post-COVID, with the OTT boom, the theatrical base has eroded, and non-event films have seen their business contract sharply. </p>

<p>So far the movie is heading for a disappointing end, as the movie couldn&#39;t show the kind of growth it needed in the opening weekend. Let&#39;s see how far the movie can go at the box office. The one positive thing for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/do-deewane-seher-mein-twitter-review-7-tweets-to-read-before-watching-mrunal-thakur-siddhant-chaturvedis-film-1400929">Siddhant Chaturvedi </a>starrer is that it has a good clean run of a couple of weeks until <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/director-says-dhurandhar-2-and-toxic-will-eat-into-each-others-business-due-to-unfortunate-clash-people-dont-have-money-1400949">Dhurandhar </a>and Toxic releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

The drop from its <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-drops-on-wednesday-nears-rs-40-cr-in-six-days-1400877">opening weekend</a> was 73 per cent, which itself was quite ordinary. The total box office collections after ten days in release are short of Rs. 50 crore nett, which it is expected to cross today.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shahid Kapoor and Triptii Dimri starrer had a so-so opening day, which it followed with a rather meh trend. There were two surprisingly</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">days on Monday and Tuesday, thanks to the BOGO offer and some feeding, but then it dropped on Wednesday and since then has only gone further down. Even the second weekend saw a mediocre growth on Saturday, and Sunday saw collections falling, thanks in large part to the cricket match in the evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first weekend, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. There won&rsquo;t be much going on at the box office till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic releases, it will possibly crawl its way towards Rs. 60 crore nett.</p>

Reports suggest that they will be getting married in the presence of friends and family in a private ceremony at a palace in Udaipur, Rajasthan.

Originally slated for a grand theatrical debut on January 9, 2026, the project has reportedly been stalled due to pending certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The delay has disappointed fans who were eagerly looking forward to seeing the superstar on the big screen in what is being described as his last film before a full-fledged career plunge.</p>

<p><strong>CBFC yet to begin review</strong></p>

<p>According to multiple reports, the holdup stems from the revising committee of the CBFC not commencing the review process. Last week it was reported, the newly appointed panel has neither initiated re-censoring proceedings nor communicated any official update to the production house of the film, KVN Productions. Without the required certification or acknowledgment, the makers are unable to finalize a release plan. Apparently, the lack of clarity has added to the further speculation in the industry, leaving the film&rsquo;s fate hanging in the balance.</p>

<p><strong>June 2026 Release to be considered</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new update shared by Valai Pechu suggests that the team is exploring an alternative release window. If pending formalities are completed in time, the H. Vinoth directorial could potentially arrive in theaters in June 2026. The tentative date being considered is Thursday, June 18, strategically kept before Vijay&rsquo;s 52nd birthday and coinciding with the Muharram long weekend.</p>

<p><strong>No official confirmation given</strong></p>

<p>Despite the growing buzz around a June release, the makers of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-thalapathy-vijay-confessed-having-one-sided-crushes-i-used-to-get-attracted-to-1380634">Vijay</a> starrer have not issued any formal statement. According to reports, it is indicated that internal discussions are ongoing, with June emerging as the most viable option should certification hurdles be resolved. Until then, Jana Nayagan release date remains unconfirmed, with fans awaiting definitive news on when Vijay&rsquo;s final cinematic outing will finally see the light of day.</p>

Originally released in 2004, the sports action drama returned to the cinemas this weekend and it opened to a superb reception. Debuted with Rs. 60 lakh, the movie recorded a jump on Day 2 and collected Rs. 70 lakh, bringing the two-day cume to Rs. 1.30 crore gross at the Tamil Nadu box office. </p>

<p>Based on the current trends, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/ghilli-box-office-collections-thalapathy-vijay-starrer-obilterate-opening-record-for-indian-re-releases-1297720">Ghilli </a>is looking to record its first weekend of Rs. 2 crore or so, which is a solid result for a film, which had a mega re-release just 2 years ago and holds the record for biggest re-release for the Tamil film industry by a huge margin. For the record, Ghilli collected over Rs. 20 crore in its home state during its previous re-release, which is still a dream to achieve for other re-releases. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how the Thalapathy Vijay and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/7-trisha-krishnan-movies-on-ott-that-prove-shes-a-powerhouse-performer-1377856">Trisha Krishnan</a> starrer performs in this inning. Even if the movie collects 1/3rd of what the movie did two years back will consider as a success. </p>

There is a growth of 60 per cent from the opening day, which would normally be good but when the level of business is so low, you need to double or treble to succeed at the box office. This jump doesn&#39;t cut it at all.&nbsp;</p>

Post-COVID, with the OTT boom, the theatrical base has eroded, and non-event films have seen their business contract sharply.&nbsp;It will be interesting to see how Assi performs further. Since there is no significant release until Dhurandhar and Toxic&nbsp;(March 19), Assi has a good scope of clear run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

There was a 40&nbsp;per cent growth in business, which is good, but the business remains at low levels. There should be a big growth today, as Punjabi films do strongly on Sundays, and since the business is at a low level, the growth in percentage could turn out to be particularly big.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overseas, the film is faring comparatively better, especially in Canada. There, it is outperforming Saunkan Saunkanay 2, the highest-grossing Punjabi film domestically over the past two years. The two-day overseas box office gross stands at USD 475K (Rs. 4.35&nbsp;crore) approx, giving the film a worldwide box office gross of Rs. 5.75 crore approx. Led by Ammy Virk and Binnu Dhillon, the film is now eyeing a weekend total in the range of Rs. 9-9.50 crore approx.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjabi film box office in India has fallen off from the highs of the 2010s, when the business was growing and sort of peaked towards the end of the decade. The quality of films aside, one of the major driving factors is demographic change. A sustained wave of emigration in the late 2010s and early 2020s has reshaped the core audience base. A large chunk of the business has shifted from India to overseas markets like Canada and Australia. It is now common for overseas collections to be multiple times higher than those in India. In contrast, pre-COVID, the business used to be more domestic-heavy, with rarely any film collecting more overseas than in India.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the industry is facing a double whammy by missing out on some potential big grossers that have not secured a release in India due to external factors, such as featuring Pakistani artists (Sardaar Ji 3 and Chal Mera Putt 4) or facing censor issues (Punjab 95). Audiences are also not as keen on giving original films a chance as they were in the previous decade, with comedy sequels being the only ones getting traction from time to time. However, lately, even some of these comedy sequels are failing, with Bambukat 2 seemingly the latest addition to that list.</p>

The film registered around 50 per cent growth from Friday, which is on the lower side compared to the kind of jumps films tend to witness on their second Saturdays these days, with many even doubling their Friday numbers. However, with the business having remained at an elevated level through the week due to BOGO offers since Monday, a relatively muted surge over the weekend was always on the cards.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The film isn&rsquo;t expected to show much growth on Sunday for the kind of film it is, but since the business is at a low level, the growth might come. There is a cricket match today, which may also limit the growth. Accordingly, the Shahid Kapoor and Triptii Dimri starrer will rake in Rs. 7.50-8 crore nett over its second weekend, for a total of over/under Rs. 50 crore nett at EOD today. There won&rsquo;t be much going on at the box office till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic releases, it will possibly crawl its way towards Rs. 60 crore nett.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first weekend, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and Tuesday briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that, but the drop on Wednesday took that possibility away, and since then, it has only gone down.</p>

<p><strong>Jithu Madhavan confirms Suriya 47 to be a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Tamil movie</strong></p>

<p>During a recent media interaction at an airport, Jithu Madhavan was asked whether <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/suriya-47-jithu-madhavans-next-with-suriya-begins-with-pooja-ceremony-nazriya-and-naslen-join-the-ensemble-1399028">Suriya 47</a> would resemble a Malayalam film. In response, the filmmaker said, &ldquo;The shoot for Suriya 47 is ongoing, and updates will be made officially. It will be a proper Tamil film.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Naslen expected to play an important role in the movie, the director was also asked for an update on Fahadh Faasil&rsquo;s Aavesham 2. However, he clarified that nothing has been confirmed yet and that discussions are still underway.</p>

The upcoming action-comedy is said to feature the actor as an eccentric police officer who leads a team similar to himself, only to have their lives turned upside down when they are assigned a serious case.</p>

<p>With Nazriya Nazim playing the co-lead, the film will also feature Naslen in a pivotal role. Sushin Shyam will make his debut in Tamil cinema as the film&rsquo;s composer.</p>

<p><strong>Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan to begin shooting for Kalki 2898 AD: Part 2?</strong></p>

<p>According to online reports, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-to-begin-shooting-for-kalki-2898-ad-part-2-from-february-2-heres-what-we-know-1400264">Kalki 2898 AD: Part 2</a> has begun shooting this year.

<p>The current schedule is said to include key scenes that do not involve Prabhas. However, these remain unconfirmed reports, as no official announcement has been made yet.</p>

<p><strong>More about Kalki 2898 AD</strong></p>

<p>Kalki 2898 AD begins at the end of the Mahabharata&rsquo;s Kurukshetra War, marking the onset of the Kali Yuga in 3102 BC. After the war, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna with the responsibility of protecting Lord Vishnu&rsquo;s final avatar when the time comes.</p>

<p>Six thousand years later, in 2898 AD, the world has transformed into a harsh dystopia ruled through fear by a self-proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to appease him in hopes of gaining access to his abundant land, known as the Complex, others rise in rebellion against his tyranny.</p>

<p>As hope begins to fade, a new light emerges in the form of an unborn child carried by SUM-80, also known as Sumathi. With Yaskin and his followers determined to extract the child&rsquo;s life force, an epic tale unfolds, setting the stage for the rest of the saga.</p>

<p>The first installment starred Prabhas in the lead role and also featured <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-priyadarshan-says-he-wanted-to-make-hungama-with-amitabh-bachchan-and-not-paresh-rawal-says-making-last-attempt-1397072">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Deepika Padukone, and Kamal Haasan in prominent roles.

His family shared a confirmation, as reported by PEOPLE, that he had breathed his last surrounded by his family and close friends following a battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that lasted around a year after being publicly revealed in April 2025. Now, a new interview has been released by Netflix, taken before the actor&rsquo;s passing, covering some of his last words to the world. It held a special message to his two kids, Billie and Georgia.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane speaks to teenage daughters in a chat revealed posthumously</strong></p>

<p>As a part of the platform&rsquo;s interview series, Famous Last Words, Eric Dane&rsquo;s final chat in front of the camera was revealed to the world. It included a confirmation on both sides that the same would be shared only after his passing. So, one day later, it was released globally for the fans of the star. He spoke to his children while looking at the camera to the best of his ability, and said, &ldquo;Billie and Georgia, these words are for you. I tried. I stumbled sometimes, but I tried. Overall, we had a blast, didn&rsquo;t we? I remember all the times we spent at the beach, the two of you, me and mom &mdash; in Santa Monica, Hawaii, Mexico. I see you now playing in the ocean for hours, my water babies. Those days, pun intended, were heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to share four of his biggest learnings in life, with the advice to live in the present being his first. He wanted them to cherish every moment and not dwell on the past, unlike what he did. The Euphoria star also wished his kids could be in love, whether with another person or something, and that it was for them to decide. He went on to share his passion for acting and how it brought him the best and some of the worst days in his life. His third piece of advice was to find friends who are not just there for the good bits but also the bad ones, and don&rsquo;t hesitate to call you out on it, as they are the ones who can shape you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, he shared how they must not stop fighting and wanting to live no matter what. &ldquo;Fight with every ounce of your being, and with dignity. When you face challenges, health or otherwise, fight. Never give up. Fight until your last breath. This disease is slowly taking my body, but it will never take my spirit,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Eric Dane&rsquo;s final words follow his family&rsquo;s request for privacy as they grieve, and amid countless <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-passes-away-greys-anatomys-kevin-mckidd-euphorias-sam-levinson-and-nina-dobrev-share-tributes-1400910">co-stars and fans&rsquo; tributes</a>.

Actress Replaces Engagement Ring With Gold Band]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1508315441_zendaya-tom-holland-1.webp"></img><p>Tinsel Town&rsquo;s favorite couple, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/are-zendaya-and-tom-holland-expecting-their-first-child-amidst-wedding-rumors-heres-what-we-know-1400556">Tom Holland and Zendaya</a>, got engaged back in December 2024 over the holidays. With many speculations surrounding their impending marriage, the two have remained tight-lipped about it, choosing to be as private as possible. However, a recent update seems to have their fans jumping around in excitement. On February 18 local time, the Dune actress was spotted in Beverly Hills with a gold band on her ring finger, raising speculations of a secret wedding to the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-tom-holland-blend-romance-and-work-with-london-walk-and-indian-lunch-on-spider-man-set-1395388">Spider-Man</a> himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zendaya and Tom Holland may have gotten married secretly, and here&rsquo;s what we know about it</strong></p>

<p>As per a Hello! report, the 29-year-old was photographed alongside film producer Josh Lieberman in Los Angeles on Wednesday. While going for a laid-back look in a white jacket over a plain T-shirt and some loose trousers, it was her hand that grabbed the most eyeballs. It was belatedly shared that she had swapped out her 5-carat diamond ring from fianc&eacute; Tom Holland for a shiny gold band on her ring finger, leading to questions about whether the two lovers had gotten married in a secret ceremony already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-drops-her-cutesy-throwback-pic-to-celebrate-28th-birthday-pens-truly-means-the-world-to-me-1345546">Zendaya</a> and Tom Holland have not commented on the same, the same could very well be possible for the couple, who have always opted for privacy around their relationship. Previously, there were a lot of questions about the duo possibly getting married this year; however, her close friend and popular stylist, Law Roach, had shared in July 2025 that the process hadn&rsquo;t even been started back then. Six months on, and we think it&rsquo;s very much achievable that the two held a small ceremony without the knowledge of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After dating since 2021, the couple chose not to announce their engagement, but the actress stepped onto the Golden Globes 2025 red carpet with a new sparkler on her finger, confirming it. Later, a source shared that the proposal happened over the holidays in December 2024. She was seen frequenting the set of his films in recent months, as the couple spent every possible moment together between busy schedules.</p>

All three films failed to get a start, with combined collections of around Rs. 2.50 crore from three on over 9000 shows. Assi had the widest release of the three, while Do Deewane Seher Mein came up with higher&nbsp;collections.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/do-deewane-sheher-mein-advance-booking-siddhant-chaturvedi-and-mrunal-thakur-starrer-sells-10000-tickets-on-bookmyshow-1400903">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a>&nbsp;collected&nbsp;Rs. 1.15-1.25 crore nett approx on its first day. This is a low number, but it&rsquo;s not really a day one film and what matters more is how it does today on Saturday. If it manages to grow well over the weekend and then hold closer to Friday numbers on weekdays, it could have a run of sorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/assi-twitter-review-11-tweets-to-read-before-watching-taapsee-pannu-in-anubhav-sinhas-courtroom-drama-1400924">Assi</a> collected around Rs. 1 crore nett approx on Friday, substantially lower than the openings of the previous collaboration of Taapsee Pannu and Anubhav Sinha, Thappad, which opened at Rs. 2.75 crore nett in 2020. Those were comparatively better times for the box office, particularly for films in this space. Post-COVID, with the OTT boom, the theatrical base has eroded, and non-event films have seen their business contract sharply. Thappad eventually went on to collect Rs. 30 crore nett approx, a figure that was viewed as below par by the trade at the time (trade tends to be stringent with such films). If that number was achieved today, it would likely be viewed far more favourably.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Shatak: Sangh Ke 100 Varsh was a non-starter, collecting around Rs. 20&nbsp;lakh nett. The very fact that an AI film is not only given a theatrical release but also has an A-lister from the industry endorsing and promoting it is, quite frankly, appalling. The film may get some political support, which could lead to growth in business at some point, if at all.</p>

Arshad said that until Aryan&rsquo;s series came out, no one knew what he was. But now, it&rsquo;s known what he&rsquo;s all about. &ldquo;He is a star without being an actor, and not because he&rsquo;s Shah Rukh&rsquo;s son. At a young age, he has multiple businesses running,&rdquo; he opined.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/shah-rukh-khan-makes-stylish-entry-in-mumbai-with-wife-gauri-and-suhana-khan-after-celebrating-new-year-video-1399607">Suhana Khan</a>, on the other hand, he says, is a sweet kid who is working hard on her big-screen debut film, King. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not an ounce of bad behaviour in both of them. They are bound to succeed. There&rsquo;s too much goodwill going on,&rdquo; he divulged.</p>

<p>When asked about his relationship with Shah Rukh, Arshad was quick to state that the Pathaan actor is a good host and a wonderful human being. &ldquo;He&#39;s one of those guys who has given my profession dignity,&rdquo; stated Arshad, adding that Khan, along with Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, &quot;made us look so good all over the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well-behaved, talented, and well spoken. The whole industry owes it to them,&rdquo; concluded the Golmaal Again star.

Overseas was a slightly better, where it earned USD 200K (Rs. 1.85 crore) approx, giving it a worldwide first day number of nearly Rs. 2.50 crore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starring Ammy Virk and Binoo Dhillon, Bambukat 2 is the sequel to the 2016 blockbuster, Bambukat. The original film had a bumper opening of Rs. 1.60 crore (Rs. 1.48 crore nett) in India, registering the fourth biggest opening ever for a Punjabi film at the time. In comparison, the sequel has managed less than half of that figure, closer to a third, in fact, which is undeniably disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjabi film box office in India has fallen off from the highs of the 2010s, when the business was growing and sort of peaked towards the end of the decade. The quality of films aside, one of the major driving factors is demographic change. A sustained wave of emigration in the late 2010s and early 2020s has reshaped the core audience base. A large chunk of the business has shifted from India to overseas markets like Canada and Australia. It is now common for overseas collections to be multiple times higher than those in India. In contrast, pre-COVID, the business used to be more domestic-heavy, with rarely any film collecting more overseas than in India.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the industry is facing a double whammy by missing out on some potential big grossers that have not secured a release in India due to external factors, such as featuring Pakistani artists (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/sardaar-ji-3-box-office-diljit-dosanjh-starrer-becomes-highest-grossing-punjabi-film-overseas-surpassing-jatt-and-juliet-3-1394701">Sardaar Ji 3</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/chal-mera-putt-4-box-office-fourth-biggest-opening-weekend-for-a-punjabi-film-1395062">Chal Mera Putt 4</a>) or facing censor issues (Punjab 95). Audiences are also not as keen on giving original films a chance as they were in the previous decade, with comedy sequels being the only ones getting traction from time to time. However, lately, even some of these comedy sequels are failing, with Bambukat 2 seemingly the latest addition to that list.</p>

If the reports are to be believed, the duo will tie the knot on February 26 in a private celebration in Udaipur attended only by their close friends and family. While the guest list has been kept under wraps, it is expected that the intimate affair will have some of the biggest stars in South cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the couple has reportedly planned a big reception back in Hyderabad for their industry colleagues and other friends on March 4, 2026.

The drop from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-worldwide-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-films-rakes-in-rs-68-cr-in-first-week-1400915">Thursday</a> was 25-30 per cent. Films these days tend to stay flat on Fridays, especially those catering to bigger centres. However, since O&rsquo; Romeo had a partial holiday on Thursday and a BOGO offer was in effect on weekdays, which kept the business elevated. As such, a drop was largely expected, but it could have been softer at around 10-15 per cent. What it has is a bit excessive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was competition from two new releases, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/do-deewane-sheher-mein-advance-booking-siddhant-chaturvedi-and-mrunal-thakur-starrer-sells-10000-tickets-on-bookmyshow-1400903">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a> and Assi,&nbsp;but neither of the two got a start, and O&rsquo; Romeo remained the film with the most showcasing. The eight-day running total stands at Rs. 44 crore nett approx. The second weekend is expected to collect Rs. 8&nbsp;crore nett, which will take it around Rs. 50 crore by Sunday. The film is a FLOP, but since there won&rsquo;t be much going on at the box office till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic releases, it will possibly crawl its way towards Rs. 60 crore nett.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first weekend, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and Tuesday briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that, but the drop on Wednesday took that possibility away, and since then, it has only gone down.</p>

Makers reportedly censor sequel glimpse titled Dilli]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1222295385_kaithi-2-karthi-loki-webp.webp"></img><p>Kaithi, starring Karthi, has been a fan-favorite film of the actor, and many fans have been eagerly waiting for its sequel. As the film&rsquo;s future remains unclear, a recent report has surfaced online indicating a possible sequel.</p>

<p><strong>Is Karthi&rsquo;s Kaithi 2 set to be launched soon?</strong></p>

<p>According to online reports, the makers of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/is-kaithi-2-still-on-cards-karthi-breaks-silence-after-lokesh-kanagaraj-announces-next-movie-aa23-with-allu-arjun-1400006">Kaithi</a>, Dream Warrior Pictures, have reportedly censored a video glimpse titled Dilli. The 30-second promo is expected to mark the announcement of the sequel and was reportedly certified by the board on February 19, 2026.</p>

<p>While there has been no official confirmation, it is worth noting that in Kaithi, Karthi played the character Dilli, who became a fan favorite. The project later evolved into the Lokesh Kanagaraj Cinematic Universe (LCU).</p>

<p>Earlier in January, Karthi was asked whether Kaithi 2 would happen. However, the actor revealed that he was not aware of any developments and said that only Lokesh Kanagaraj could provide a clear answer.</p>

<p>Directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/lokesh-kanagaraj-breaks-his-silence-about-quitting-kaithi-2-will-not-leave-without-completing-kaithi-2-vikram-2-rolex-1400209">Lokesh Kanagaraj</a>, Kaithi follows the story of an ex-convict, Dilli, who is forced to help a police officer while a mafia group is hot on their heels.</p>

<p>With Karthi in the lead role, the film features an ensemble cast including Narain, Arjun Das, Harish Uthaman, and George Maryan, among others, in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>The action thriller marked the first installment in the Lokesh Kanagaraj Cinematic Universe, which was later expanded with Vikram, starring Kamal Haasan, and Leo, starring Vijay.</p>

<p>Moreover, the upcoming film Benz, starring Raghava Lawrence and Nivin Pauly, is also set to be part of the LCU.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was speculated that Lokesh Kanagaraj would begin work on Kaithi 2 after wrapping up Coolie. However, the filmmaker recently announced that his next movie will be the Allu Arjun starrer, tentatively titled AA23 (LK07), marking his directorial debut in Telugu cinema.</p>

<p><strong>Karthi&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vaa-vaathiyaar-review-karthi-starrer-offers-a-fresh-idea-that-turns-loud-corny-and-forgettable-1400265">Karthi</a> was last seen in the lead role in Vaa Vaathiyaar. Directed by Nalan Kumarasamy, the film focuses on a police officer who is influenced by his grandfather to adopt elements of the late M. G. Ramachandran&rsquo;s cinematic characters.</p>

<p>As a result, the officer develops an alter ego that fights against wrongdoers while masquerading as an MGR-inspired character. Apart from the Thozha actor, the film also stars Krithi Shetty, Sathyaraj, Shilpa Manjunath, and Rajkiran in key roles.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Karthi will appear in the spy action drama Sardar 2, and he is currently working on Marshal.</p>

During the interaction, the Rebel Star spoke about his initial plan to appear in three films in 2026 to offer more to his fans. However, despite working on three projects, only two have managed to hit theaters this year.</p>

<p><strong>Prabhas on the initial plan to release 3 movies in 2026</strong></p>

<p>Speaking with the team of Couple Friendly, actor Santosh Sobhan expressed his admiration for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prasanth-varmas-prabhas-starrer-baka-shelved-after-hanu-man-and-rakshas-troubles-report-1400885">Prabhas</a> and his films. In response, the Baahubali actor said that he wishes to do more films for his fans. However, despite working on three projects, only two of them will be released this year due to scheduling constraints.</p>

<p>The actor said, &ldquo;I know what you all want. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to make three movies per year. But due to release schedules, only two are coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Prabhas&rsquo; lineup this year, The Raja Saab was released in theaters during Sankranti, while Fauzi is expected to hit the big screens during Dussehra 2026. Earlier, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/spirit-release-date-prabhas-and-sandeep-reddy-vangas-cop-action-drama-to-hit-screens-on-march-5-2027-1399970">Spirit</a>&nbsp;was slated to release in 2026; however, the makers have officially announced that the film will now release on March 5, 2027.</p>

<p><strong>Prabhas&rsquo; work front</strong></p>

<p>Prabhas was last seen in the lead role in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/the-raja-saab-ott-release-when-and-where-to-watch-prabhas-starrer-horror-comedy-online-after-28-days-of-theatrical-run-1400344">The Raja Saab</a>. Directed by Maruthi, the horror-comedy revolves around Raja and his rivalry with his late grandfather, a malevolent spirit who haunts a mansion.</p>

<p>Apart from the Saaho actor, the film also starred Sanjay Dutt, Nidhhi Agerwal, Malavika Mohanan, and Riddhi Kumar, among others, in key roles. The film received an underwhelming response from both critics and audiences upon its release. It is currently available for streaming on JioHotstar.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the actor will appear in Fauzi, a period epic. The film features him as a soldier of the Azad Hind Force and presents an alternative, fictionalized retelling of historical events.</p>

<p>The movie is set to feature internet sensation Imanvi as the female lead, with veteran actors Mithun Chakraborty, Jaya Prada, and Anupam Kher appearing in key roles.</p>

<p>Additionally, the actor will also star in Spirit, a cop action drama directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, co-starring Triptii Dimri.</p>

<p>According to a report by Valai Pechu, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-king-main-hoon-na-2-front-runner-to-be-shah-rukh-khans-next-farah-khan-cracks-double-role-idea-for-srk-1400476">Shah Rukh Khan</a> is expected to shoot for Jailer 2 for 7&ndash;8 days.

<p>Following Jailer 2, Rajinikanth will appear in the lead role in the tentatively titled Thalaivar173. The movie is set to be directed by Cibi Chakravarthy, best known for Don, and is expected to be a light-hearted action entertainer.</p>

<p>Initially, the project was set to be directed by Sundar C. However, due to prior commitments, the filmmaker opted out of the film.</p>

Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that the trailer of the Ranveer Singh-led spectacle is slated to drop in the first week of March, around March 5, perfectly setting the stage for its grand Eid release.</p>

<p>According to a source close to the development, Dhurandhar 2 promises to be bigger, grander, and far more intense.&nbsp;&quot;The scale of the second part surpasses the first film in every aspect...from action to emotions&nbsp;and world-building. The team has expanded it like never before, and the trailer will give audiences a solid glimpse into the evolved world of Dhurandhar,&quot; revealed an insider.</p>

<p>The trailer is said to feature brand-new visuals that introduce unexplored territories&nbsp;within the narrative. However, what is truly grabbing attention in early previews is Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s fierce transformation. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-walks-out-of-don-3-amidst-dhurandhar-success-hunt-for-a-new-don-begins-1399363">Ranveer Singh</a> is undoubtedly the highlight of the trailer. His screen presence and physical transformation as Lyari&rsquo;s King is&nbsp;being raved about internally. He brings a certain gravitas&nbsp;that will elevate&nbsp;the sequel to another level,&rdquo; the source added.</p>

<p>Insiders suggest that the trailer cut has been designed massively, without revealing too much of it. With its strategic early-March launch, the makers aim to build&nbsp;momentum&nbsp;for Eid release, positioning Dhurandhar 2 as one of the biggest cinematic events of the year.</p>

<p>If early reactions within the industry are anything to go by, the roar is about to echo louder than ever!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Aditya Dhar, and produced by Jio Studios and B62 Studios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wuthering Heights should aim for a spike in its second weekend in order to escalate its lifetime target. Based on the current trends, the movie is looking for a finish under Rs. 5 crore only.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mrunal Thakur on why Dhanush attended Son of Sardar 2 event at her request</strong></p>

<p>Speaking with Mirchi Plus while promoting her new release, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/mrunal-thakur-reflects-on-arranged-marriage-amid-dating-rumors-with-dhanush-if-everyone-is-on-board-1400913">Mrunal Thakur</a> said, &ldquo;Dhanush sir&hellip; I mean, after watching Raayan, Maari, Raanjhanaa, and Captain Miller, I am a big fan of his. Oh my God, Asuran is something I can watch multiple times. He&rsquo;s such an institution, and it takes so much for an actor to be that way and to bring out such performances from other actors too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It so happened that while they were shooting Tere Ishk Mein, I said, &lsquo;Sir, can you please come for the screening of Son of Sardaar?&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know he would actually come. He just came, and I was so happy. I felt it was really sweet. I really wish to work with him one day,&rdquo; the actress added.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Mrunal Thakur and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/after-ranveer-singh-and-vikram-is-director-shankar-eyeing-dhanush-for-magnum-opus-velpari-find-out-1400869">Dhanush</a> have been reportedly seeing each other.

<p>Mrunal Thakur recently appeared in the lead role in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/3-hindi-movies-releasing-this-week-in-theaters-do-deewane-seher-mein-to-assi-and-veer-murarbaji-the-battle-of-purandar-1400789">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a>, co-starring Siddhant Chaturvedi.

As they battle insecurities and societal pressure, their journey takes them from the chaos of the city to the serenity of the mountains.</p>

<p>Directed by Ravi Udyawar, the film also features Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Deepraj Rana, and Mona Ambegaonkar, among others, in key roles.</p>

<p>The movie further added Rs. 2.40 crore to the tally on weekdays, with its Day 7 of Rs. 40 lakh. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/funky-box-office-collections-vishwak-sen-and-kayadu-lohar-starrer-registers-disappointing-opening-weekend-grosses-rs-6-crore-in-3-days-1400791">Funky </a>wrapped its opening week at just Rs. 8.65 crore gross at the Indian box office, which is nothing but disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going by the present trends, the Vishwak Sen starrer won&#39;t be able to survive another week. If it doesn&#39;t see any spike on its second weekend, it might end its entire theatrical journey around Rs. 10-12 crore only.&nbsp;</p>

Mohanlal starrer franchise to likely end with Georgekutty’s final sacrifice for family]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/2122350682_drishyam-3-plot-leak-webp.webp"></img><p>Drishyam 3, starring Mohanlal in the lead role, is set to release in theatres on April 2, 2026. Directed by Jeethu Joseph, the upcoming film will mark the franchise&rsquo;s final installment, with huge expectations riding on it.</p>

<p>As the release is just months away, the film&rsquo;s plot has reportedly surfaced online. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>

<p><strong>Did Mohanlal starrer Drishyam 3 plot leak online?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Movies Singapore, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/drishyam-3-release-date-mohanlal-confirms-georgekutty-to-return-to-the-big-screen-on-april-2-2026-1400777">Drishyam 3</a> once again follows the story of Georgekutty. The film is said to focus not only on protecting his family from the world but also on shielding them from the truth and the burden of what binds them together.</p>

<p>As a new force begins to close in on him and his family, Georgekutty reportedly witnesses cracks in his carefully crafted plan, with adversaries who are more determined and organized than ever before.</p>

<p>With the walls closing in around his conscience, his relationships, and the fragile normalcy he has worked so hard to build, the threat is no longer merely external. The film is said to explore how much more the man is willing to sacrifice for the sake of his loved ones. However, this remains an unconfirmed plot, and an official update is still awaited.</p>

<p><strong>More about Drishyam 3</strong></p>

<p>Drishyam 3 is the upcoming installment in the crime thriller franchise directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/will-drishyam-3-be-the-endgame-jeethu-joseph-breaks-silence-on-mohanlals-crime-thriller-1400429">Jeethu Joseph</a>.&nbsp;The original Drishyam follows the story of Georgekutty, a middle-class man who leads a modest life with his wife and daughters.</p>

<p>Their lives take a drastic turn when Georgekutty and his family come under suspicion after IG Geetha Prabhakar&rsquo;s son, Varun Prabhakar, goes missing. With several clues pointing toward Georgekutty&rsquo;s involvement, the film explores the truth and how the family navigates an intense investigation.</p>

<p>Released in 2021, Drishyam 2 continued the narrative by exploring new dimensions of the story. With the third installment, the franchise is expected to delve into yet another chapter in the family&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Apart from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/l366-first-look-mohanlal-introduced-as-pure-love-ts-lovelajan-in-tharun-moorthys-cop-action-comedy-1400310">Mohanlal</a>, the third film will feature Meena, Ansiba Hassan, Esther Anil, Asha Sharath, Murali Gopy, and Siddique, among others, reprising their previous roles. The film is scheduled to hit theatres on April 2, 2026.</p>

<p>Later, the Hindi remake, also titled Drishyam 3 and starring Ajay Devgn, is set to release on October 2, 2026.</p>

The romantic drama collected Rs. 11.50&nbsp; crore in its second week, bringing the two 14-day cume to Rs. 26.50 crore gross at the Indian box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Madhan directorial recorded a drop of 20 percent from the previous week, which is a strong hold to say the least.&nbsp; The jump was majorly due to Valentine&#39;s Day week and the positive word-of-mouth among the audience.</p>

<p>It is expected to see a good spike in its third weekend. However, it will have to face new releases including Thalapathy Vijay&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/ghilli-box-office-collections-thalapathy-vijay-starrer-obilterate-opening-record-for-indian-re-releases-1297720">Ghilli </a>re-release. If the movie sustained well in its third week and performed on a similar pace, it might end of doing Rs. 40 crore in its final run.

The couple that has long kept the details of its nuptials private, however, an alleged look at their wedding invitation card, including date, time, location, and concerned contact numbers, was shared online. Now, owing to the heightened interest, the two have decided to hire an international security firm to handle their celebrations, as reported by India Today.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna plan tight security for the wedding day</strong></p>

<p>With under a week left to their marriage ceremony, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-deverakonda-rashmika-mandanna-net-worth-inside-soon-to-wed-couples-reported-rs-133-cr-combined-fortune-1400858">Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna</a> are having to deal with a lot of security issues. Every day, a new detail of their wedding is being shared on the internet, and now the duo has sought the help of a global team to help them with the management of any possible breaches on their big day. They will also be in touch with local authorities to ensure the smooth progression of the festivities. The two actors wish for utmost protection so as to maintain the intimate nature of their nuptials and have taken additional precautions to ensure so.</p>

<p>A source close to the couple shared, &ldquo;To secure the perimeter of the palace, a specialised agency from abroad has been hired. They will be collaborating with local Rajasthan security to assure absolute privacy of the events.&rdquo; The couple wished for absolute privacy of their wedding, with earlier reports suggesting that NDAs were signed by involved parties, including vendors and guests who were asked to be discreet about the same. A no-phone rule has been implemented at the wedding for all attendees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, it was noted that following the main ceremony on February 26 in Udaipur, which will be an intimate affair, a big reception will be held in Hyderabad on March 4 for friends and industry colleagues. Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna have previously worked together on Geetha Govindam and Dear Comrade, and have kept their relationship under the radar so far.&nbsp;</p>

Combined with Rs. 51 crore (Rs. 42.50 crore nett) from the domestic market of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-nets-rs-42-cr-in-first-week-in-india-1400911">India</a>, that amounts to Rs. 68.25 crore worldwide box office gross.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While the first week&#39;s business in India is similar to Shahid Kapoor&rsquo;s other recent film Teri Baaton Main Uljha Jiya, which released in February 2024. The overseas business fell short of USD 2.80 million in the first week, which Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya had. It&rsquo;s not like Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya had done particularly strongly overseas; its performance was termed decent to good, while O Romeo is below par. The shortfall was pretty much all across the board, with the Middle East being somewhat closer, while the United States showed the largest gap, being around half of TBMAUJ, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia - New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya went on to have solid legs, nearly doubling its first week business, to collect Rs. 82.50 crore nett in India and USD 5.35 million overseas, giving it a Rs. 143 crore worldwide sum. O&rsquo; Romeo is not expected to do that and will probably end up being closer to half of that overseas and around Rs. 60-65 crore nett in India, for over/under Rs. 100 crore mark worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Given its relatively higher costs, O&rsquo; Romeo ideally needed to outperform Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya, not fall short of it.</p>

It was a holiday in Maharashtra, which kept the business flat in the state, maybe even a minor growth, while elsewhere it dropped closer to 15-20 per cent. Apart from that, the film also had a BOGO offer going on, which has kept business elevated throughout weekdays.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second week, the film faces two new films, Assi and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/do-deewane-sheher-mein-advance-booking-siddhant-chaturvedi-and-mrunal-thakur-starrer-sells-10000-tickets-on-bookmyshow-1400903">Do Deewane Sehere Mein</a>, but both of these are smaller releases, and O&rsquo; Romeo remains the film with the most showcasing. Generally, films with BOGO offer&nbsp;on weekdays have muted growth over the weekend as the offer is removed; however, the film seems to be continuing the offer, so growth may be closer to normal. The film will most likely cross Rs. 50 crore nett on Sunday and is headed for Rs. 60-65 crore closing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-film-drops-sharply-on-sunday-nets-rs-27-50-cr-first-weekend-in-india-1400782">weekend</a>, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and Tuesday briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-drops-on-wednesday-nears-rs-40-cr-in-six-days-1400877">Wednesday</a> drop has again made that possibility unlikely, and now Thursday has taken the film further down.</p>

His last moments were in the presence of his family, including two daughters, Billie and Georgia, and close friends. The actor was 53 and had previously announced his <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-wishes-als-diagnosis-is-not-the-end-of-my-story-promises-hes-capable-of-more-1391338">diagnosis in April 2025</a>. Tributes for his time in the acting world began pouring in almost immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane&rsquo;s peers remember the actor following his passing</strong></p>

<p>Euphoria creator Sam Levinson revealed he is &lsquo;heartbroken&rsquo; by the loss of his &lsquo;dear friend,&rsquo; and added, &quot;Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric&#39;s family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellow actors on Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens Jr. and Sarah Drew shared a photo of the star on their Instagram stories and wrote, &quot;Rest in Peace, Buddy,&quot; and &quot;Rest in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;RIP, Buddy. Me and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-juggles-relationships-with-3-women-amid-als-battle-all-about-ex-wife-gf-and-mystery-woman-1392001">Eric Dane</a> played brothers years ago in a beautiful movie called, Wedding Wars. Good guy. Too soon. Xo J,&rdquo; John Stamos wrote on his social media.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcher wrote on X (formerly Twitter) about how the Franklin strip fanatics fantasy football league will miss the star and is sure that he&rsquo;ll be watching from above. He also vowed to join the fight to solve ALS.</p>

<p>His Charmed co-star Alyssa Milano recalled his warm existence and love for his family, &quot;He loved the absurdity of things. He loved catching people off guard. And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca [Gayheart], everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren&#39;t present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. ... The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Vampire Diaries star Nina Dobrev, who worked with the actor on Redeeming Love,&nbsp;called him &lsquo;warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate&rsquo; about his work, leading with kindness and making others feel welcomed. She hopes his demise can result in more research on ALS.</p>

<p>More memories and words of condolence are surfacing on the internet as his fellow stars and fans come to terms with his passing. His family has asked for privacy during this important time.</p>

According to a PEOPLE report, the popular actor was said to have passed away that afternoon in the presence of his friends and family. A note from his family confirmed that his demise came following his &lsquo;courageous battle&rsquo; with ALS. His family has asked to keep the rest of the details private as they mourn the loss.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane dies at 53 following nearly a year-long fight with ASL</strong></p>

<p>Back in April 2025, the star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-wishes-als-diagnosis-is-not-the-end-of-my-story-promises-hes-capable-of-more-1391338">revealed his diagnosis</a> and was met with an outpouring of support and encouragement from his many fans around the world. The actor went on to speak about his wishes to fight the battle as much as possible. Confirming his passing, his family shared, &quot;With heavy hearts, we share that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-juggles-relationships-with-3-women-amid-als-battle-all-about-ex-wife-gf-and-mystery-woman-1392001">Eric Dane</a> passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS. He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world.&quot;</p>

<p>They reiterated his passionate advocacy for &lsquo;awareness and research&rsquo; about ALS, and added, &ldquo;[He was] determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he&rsquo;s received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actor was previously supposed to be at the ALS Network Champions for Cures &amp; Care Gala in early February, but could not, due to the realities of his condition. Former Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy co-star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/ellen-pompeo-reveals-chat-with-greys-anatomy-co-star-eric-dane-on-his-asl-diagnosis-phone-rang-30-seconds-later-1400442">Ellen Pompeo</a> went on to speak about their call after his ALS diagnosis announcement, and there were no updates on him since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was previously married to actress Rebecca Gayheart, and the duo shares two children, daughters Billie and Georgia, born in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Following their divorce in 2018, she asked for it to be dismissed in March 2025. The Euphoria star is said to have been in an on-and-off relationship with director and photographer Janell Shirtcliff for over three years before his health update. He was also involved with Priya Jain, a 28-year-old actress, although they are said to have separated in June 2025.</p>

The drop from the previous week is around Rs. 60&nbsp;percent. With two new releases coming this weekend, Mardaani 3 is now in its final legs at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

It is only Rs. 1 crore away from surpassing the final earnings of Mardaani 2, which netted Rs. 46.30 crore in 2019. Based on the current trends, Mardaani 3 should emerge as the biggest grosser of the franchise in its 4th weekend itself. It is likely to wind its entire run around Rs. 48 crore to Rs. 50 crore nett in India.</p>

<p>It will be a good result for Mardaani 3, as business has gone down severely for mid-sized films in the post-pandemic times. Even&nbsp;A-list starrers are struggling to find the audience. In such times, if a female-led movie managing to recover its cost of production, its a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-starrer-cop-actioner-remains-flat-on-3rd-tuesday-cume-over-rs-44-crore-1400836" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Mardaani 3 Box Office Collections: Rani Mukerji's cop drama continues steady run, nets Rs 45 lakh on 3rd Wednesday','1400868','https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-starrer-cop-actioner-remains-flat-on-3rd-tuesday-cume-over-rs-44-crore-1400836','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerjis-cop-drama-continues-steady-run-nets-rs-45-lakh-on-3rd-wednesday-1400868','Mardaani 3','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Mardaani 3</a>&nbsp;has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

<p>The movie failed to impress the audience, which is why it didn&#39;t see any sort of growth at the box office. The Adarsh Gourav starrer is looking to finish its theatrical run around Rs. 5 crore or so, depending on how it holds during its the second week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on the current trends, the survival thriller will not able to survive against the upcoming two releases: <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/3-hindi-movies-releasing-this-week-in-theaters-do-deewane-seher-mein-to-assi-and-veer-murarbaji-the-battle-of-purandar-1400789">Do Deewane Sheher Mein and Assi</a>. Though these are small size films, still they might push Tu Yaa Main out of the cinemas.</p>

<p>Backed by Colour Yellow Productions and Bhanushali Studios, Tu Yaa Main suffered majorly due to no star face and then because of its mixed reviews. Moreover, audience now considers such movies as OTT films. The makers need to elongate the 8-week OTT window to somewhere around 6 months to save the dying business of such small/mid-budgeted films.&nbsp;</p>

It is likely to see some spike on the 5th weekend too and then march towards its final target. Based on the current trends, Border 2 is heading for a finish in the vicinity of Rs. 305 crore to Rs. 310 crore nett.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though this is a good result, it is still far lesser than Sunny Deol&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/decoding-the-economics-of-gadar-2-sunny-deol-starrer-budget-recovery-verdict-and-lifetime-box-office-1244895">Gadar 2</a>. Having said that, Border 2 emerged as the first Hit film of 2026 from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;The movie&nbsp;has done better in northern circuits, where Rajasthan is closer to BLOCKBUSTER, while Delhi-UP and East Punjab have done SUPER HIT business. The underperformance has come in central circuits of Gujarat and CPCI, which one would expect to fare strongly for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/top-10-highest-grossing-bollywood-films-post-pandemic-border-2-takes-9th-spot-dhurandhar-rules-at-no-1-1400771">Sunny Deol</a>&nbsp;film, but that hasn&#39;t happened.

The Ravi Udayawar-directed movie sold over 10,000 tickets for the opening day on ticket-booking web portal, BookMyShow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the romantic drama is looking for a low opening. As per Pinkvilla Predicts, the movie is expected to open in the vicinity of Rs. 50 lakh to Rs. 1.50 crore, with its pinpoint forecast at Rs. 1 crore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer and promos of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/3-hindi-movies-releasing-this-week-in-theaters-do-deewane-seher-mein-to-assi-and-veer-murarbaji-the-battle-of-purandar-1400789">Do Deewane Sheher Mein </a>met with positive reception, it still doesn&#39;t have much buzz among the audience, due to no star value attached to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fate of Do Deewane Sheher Mein depends heavily on word-of-mouth and then on audience&#39;s support. If the movie opens to a positive reception, it might see an instant boost in its sales. Furthermore, the movie also needs strong audience support as even movies with favourable reception are struggling at the box office in today&#39;s times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-siddhant-chaturvedi-to-play-v-shantaram-in-biopic-fardeen-khan-joins-the-cast-1398359">Siddhant Chaturvedi</a> and Mrunal Thakur starrer is clashing with Anubhav Sinha&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-final-update-for-mardaani-3-1400285">Assi</a>, starring Taapsee Pannu in the lead role. Though both are small-budget movies with no anticipation, so both can co-exist at the box office. It will be interesting to see how both these movies perform at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Shalini Ajith Kumar on the relationship shared by Ajith Kumar and Thalapathy Vijay</strong></p>

<p>In a rare public appearance, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ajith-kumar-flaunts-his-spiritual-tattoo-for-1st-time-in-temple-visit-with-wife-shalini-and-son-aadvik-pics-1397957">Shalini Ajith Kumar</a> was spotted at the JFW Awards, where she was asked about the relationship between her husband and his former co-star Thalapathy Vijay.</p>

<p>In response, the actress said, &ldquo;They have a good relationship. Both of them are very happy about each other&rsquo;s success and everything. It&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/thalapathy-vijays-father-reacts-to-jana-nayagan-delay-will-face-any-number-of-such-obstacles-1400300">Thalapathy Vijay</a> is currently awaiting the release of his final film, Jana Nayagan. Directed by H. Vinoth, the film follows the story of Vetri Kondan, a former police officer and convict who adopts a young girl named Viji and is determined to raise her as a strong and independent woman. He even persuades her to join the military despite her fear of violence.</p>

<p>Amid these events, a grave threat looms over India, one that could potentially lead to the annihilation of its people. As Vetri Kondan finds himself caught in these circumstances, a personal vendetta also emerges, forcing him to take matters into his own hands and expose the system responsible for triggering the crisis.</p>

<p>Apart from Vijay, the film also stars Pooja Hegde, Bobby Deol, Mamitha Baiju, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Prakash Raj, Narain, Priyamani, Sunil, and several others in key roles.</p>

<p>Earlier, the film was scheduled for a Pongal release but failed to secure CBFC certification in time. The dispute led to judicial intervention, which further postponed the release, and the makers are still awaiting a new release date.</p>

Here’s What We Know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/797628544_chloe-zhao-tom-cruise.webp"></img><p>The Mission Impossible grapevine has a new update, but it&rsquo;s not one the fans are necessarily happy about. Recently, reports have surfaced that the Tom Cruise-led daredevil franchise will return with yet another part despite the actor previously stating that it would end with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-cruise-bids-farewell-to-mission-impossible-at-2025-cannes-film-festival-grateful-to-entertain-1388001">Mission: Impossible &ndash; The Final Reckoning</a>. However, a report by popular tabloid Deux Moi has shaken the world of Hollywood once again as it has shared that Hamnet&rsquo;s star director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-harish-patel-reveals-what-eternals-director-chloe-zhao-said-when-he-congratulated-her-nomadland">Chlo&eacute; Zhao</a> has been in talks with the 63-year-old for a project which is believed to be MI9.</p>

<p><strong>Mission: Impossible &ndash; The Final Reckoning, not the end for Tom Cruise&#39;s Ethan Hunt? Here&rsquo;s all we know</strong></p>

<p>With &lsquo;Final&rsquo; in its name, many were accepting of the fact that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-cruise-bags-gold-mission-impossible-star-lands-guinness-world-record-for-highest-burning-parachute-jumps-1390799">Tom Cruise</a> would bring an end to his beloved but dangerous franchise of the Mission Impossible films, and so he claimed. But new murmurs have hinted that he may have changed his mind already, within a year of saying so. According to a report from the gossip outlet&rsquo;s anonymous tip, &ldquo;Chlo&eacute; Zhao is in talks to write/direct. Tom sought her out, they&rsquo;ve workshopped a treatment, script is underway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long time, Christopher McQuarrie has been the captain of the ship, forging his way ahead with some fabulous and some lukewarm receptions of the MI world&rsquo;s four films. With a supposed change in direction, one can hope there&rsquo;ll be a change in the outcome. But all of this remains mere hearsay for the time being, with no official confirmations or denials from either side.</p>

<p>As of now, Tom Cruise&rsquo;s Ethan Hunt had his grand goodbye in the 8th instalment while awaiting the release of his Alejandro G. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu directorial Digger. On the other hand, Chlo&eacute; Zhao remains dedicated to her Oscars campaign for her historical drama film Hamnet. A frontrunner for multiple accolades, the Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal starrer has been in the good graces of plenty to have a believable shot at a win, or more.&nbsp;It is up for 8 awards, across major categories including Best Picture, Best Director (Chlo&eacute; Zhao), and Best Actress (Jessie Buckley).</p>

Pramod Shetty says, ‘We know she won't invite us…’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/361647722_rashmika-pramod-webp.webp"></img><p>Rashmika Mandanna and Vijay Deverakonda are expected to tie the knot on February 26, 2026. Ahead of the wedding festivities, the actress&rsquo; former co-star Pramod Shetty has revealed whether she has invited them to her wedding or reception.</p>

<p><strong>Pramod Shetty on whether Rashmika Mandanna invited them to wedding</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the media, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kantara-chapter-1-review-rishab-shettys-final-transformation-as-chamundi-will-leave-you-breathless-rukmini-vasanth-suprises-1397366">Pramod Shetty</a> said, &ldquo;I haven&#39;t received Rashmika&#39;s wedding invitation yet. If I get it, I&#39;ll go. We know she won&rsquo;t invite us, nothing new. As for Rakshit Shetty, he&rsquo;s not a kid eating chocolate and sitting around feeling guilty about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As per a report by One India, Pramod added, &ldquo;Rakshit will rise like a phoenix. He gave a statement recently, didn&rsquo;t he? He hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere. That&rsquo;s how he writes his films. He takes some time, then comes back and calmly makes a movie. He isn&rsquo;t in as much of a hurry as we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those unaware, Pramod Shetty has been a long-time friend and collaborator of Rakshit Shetty. The Kantara: Chapter 1 actor starred alongside Rakshit and Rashmika in the latter&rsquo;s debut film Kirik Party, which was helmed by Rishab Shetty.</p>

<p>Pramod&rsquo;s comments about Rashmika and her wedding have gone viral on the internet, especially due to the shared history between the actress and Rakshit.</p>

The actors are expected to have an intimate ceremony attended only by close family members and friends.</p>

<p>As the wedding will not include actors or colleagues from the film industry, the couple is expected to host a reception for their colleagues on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Rakshit Shetty&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

Following the 2023 release, the actor is currently said to be in the writing phase of his next film, Richard Antony.</p>

<p>The upcoming project is touted to be a sequel to his 2014 film Ulidavaru Kandanthe.</p>

The couple, which has always been talked about for their long-running romance and possible troubles, has handled having a baby wonderfully well, always hanging out around the child and taking him to places. The model has repeatedly <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/hailey-bieber-opens-up-about-baby-no-2-plans-says-she-now-feels-ready-for-another-child-1398587">spoken about wanting more kids</a> with her partner and has now revealed what motherhood has been like for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hailey Bieber wants at least a second kid, but may end up having more</strong></p>

<p>During an appearance on Jake Shane&#39;s podcast Therapuss, the skincare entrepreneur opened up about coming to terms with motherhood for the first time, &quot;It is so fun. I always knew I wanted kids; I always wanted to be a mom. And then when it happens, you never know what to expect, and you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going to be like.&rdquo; She spoke about how Jack Blues is already interested in basketball and is now learning to speak &lsquo;please,&rsquo; something which he already knew how to do with the American Sign Language before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing that there were many unexpected parts of her relationship with her first child, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/hailey-biebers-team-says-her-billion-dollar-rhode-deal-has-no-ties-to-justins-scooter-braun-settlement-1394083">Hailey Bieber</a> added that one would not be able to prepare for until they&rsquo;re at that stage. But there was one thing that surely surprised her, &ldquo;I feel like I&#39;m a lot more relaxed as a mom than I thought I would be. I think especially as a first-time mom.&quot;</p>

<p>Revealing her plans to grow their family with more kids, the 29-year-old reiterated, &ldquo;I definitely do want one more. I&#39;m not in a rush, but I definitely want one more. Maybe I&#39;ll have four more. Maybe I&#39;ll have three. I don&#39;t know, I really don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just taking it one day at a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, amid rumors of trouble in paradise for Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber, the two have continued to be strong and together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backed by MRP&nbsp;Entertainment and Zion Films, the Tamil-language romantic drama is likely to continue its favorable run in the third week too.

According to a report by Gulte, the star director&rsquo;s much-awaited project, Baka, starring South Indian star Prabhas in the lead role, has supposedly been taken off the floors. As per coverage on February 19, the project has been cut off from the protagonist&rsquo;s side, who was seemingly unhappy after the first few days of filming.</p>

<p><strong>Prasanth Varma&rsquo;s Baka &lsquo;may not be happening&rsquo; after Prabhas steps away</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/before-kalki-2898-ad-and-spirit-prabhas-to-rejoin-fauzi-sets-after-italy-vacation-find-out-1400106">Prabhas</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rishab-shetty-shares-big-update-on-jai-hanuman-with-prasanth-varma-fabulous-script-i-couldnt-refuse-1397198">Prasanth Varma</a> who fans were excited for working on a project together, may not move ahead after all. According to the reports, the lead star was involved in a test shoot a few months ago. However, following the filming, the movie has seemingly been called off and appears not to be happening at all. Reports say, &lsquo;Prabhas did not feel comfortable after the shoot and is said to have declined the project.&rsquo; The actor has not yet made any comments on the same.</p>

<p>Tentatively titled Baka, the film in which Prabhas was set to take on the role of Bakasur was being backed by the famed Mythri Movie Makers. Neither the creators nor the director has shared an update on the filming or cancelation plans so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, similar fates were met with three other projects being helmed by Prasanth Varma. Firstly, Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s planned Telugu debut with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-and-prasanth-varma-amicably-part-ways-on-rakshas-due-to-creative-differences-1307753">Rakshas</a> (later referenced as Brahma Rakshasa) was canceled over creative differences and scheduling conflicts. Later, Hanu-Man was revealed to have had issues with the producer Niranjan Reddy, who claimed that a much higher expense came into play, unlike the projected Rs 20 crore budget. The film was released in 2024 with Teja Sajja at the forefront and went on to become a hit at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nandamuri Mokshagna&rsquo;s debut film, which was touted to be in the same genre as Hanu-Man, was cancelled on the day of launch and eventually postponed indefinitely. With Baka&rsquo;s possible end, it seems that director Prasanth Varma has more than a few shelved projects on his hands.&nbsp;</p>

As reports suggest that the duo is finally set to tie the knot on February 26, 2026, here&rsquo;s a quick look at what fans can expect from the wedding.</p>

<p><strong>Everything to know about Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna&rsquo;s wedding</strong></p>

<p>According to online reports, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-deverakondas-hyderabad-house-lights-up-ahead-of-udaipur-wedding-with-rashmika-mandanna-video-1400876">Vijay Deverakonda</a> and Rashmika Mandanna are planning to keep their wedding ceremony private and away from the public eye. The couple is reportedly keen on maintaining a low profile regarding their union and has enforced a strict no-phone policy to prevent pictures from the ceremony from being leaked.</p>

<p>Moreover, the official team responsible for organizing the wedding is required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Additionally, in a rare move, the celebrity wedding will not include actors or colleagues from the film industry who have not been invited, and only immediate family members and close friends will attend.</p>

<p>Reportedly, two separate pre-wedding rituals will be hosted by Vijay&rsquo;s and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandanna-to-tie-wedding-knot-on-february-26-2026-invitation-card-goes-viral-1400797">Rashmika</a>&rsquo;s families, as both are eager to honor their respective traditions. Additionally, the couple will pen handwritten notes to their friends, requesting that no gifts be given.</p>

<p>Following the wedding, the couple is planning to take a month-long break from acting. A grand reception for friends and colleagues is scheduled to take place on March 4, 2026. Earlier, an invitation card for the duo&rsquo;s wedding reportedly went viral on the internet.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Vijay Deverakonda is set to appear in the lead role in the upcoming film Ranabaali. Directed by Rahul Sankrityan, the period action drama will reportedly feature Rashmika as the co-lead and is slated for release on September 11, 2026.</p>

<p>Moreover, the actor also has Rowdy Janardhana, a gritty actioner alongside Keerthy Suresh. The film is scheduled to be released in December this year.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Rashmika Mandanna will next appear in Cocktail 2 and Mysaa. Additionally, there are reports that she may play a negative role in Allu Arjun&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/aa22xa6-allu-arjun-and-atlees-movie-to-go-dhurandhar-way-likely-to-be-made-in-2-parts-1399231">AA22xA6</a>, directed by Atlee.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/toxic-update-yash-reunites-with-kgf-distributors-aa-films-aiming-for-a-massive-theatrical-release-1400682">Toxic: A Fairy Tale for Grown-Ups</a> is a period action thriller co-written and directed by Geetu Mohandas. Apart from Yash, the film features Kiara Advani, Nayanthara, Huma Qureshi, Tara Sutaria, and Rukmini Vasanth as co-leads. The cast also includes Akshay Oberoi, Sudev Nair, Amit Tiwari, and several others in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>The film has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English and will be dubbed and released in six Indian languages, including Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, and Tamil.</p>

<p>The music and background score have been composed by Ravi Basrur. John Wick action director JJ Perry has choreographed some of the action sequences, while the Anbariv duo has handled select action portions.</p>

<p>For those unaware, a glimpse of Toxic was unveiled last month on Yash&rsquo;s birthday, introducing the Rocking Star&rsquo;s character, Raya. The content showcased in the glimpse contained sensitive elements that created significant buzz online, particularly due to its perceived links to Geetu&rsquo;s earlier statements during a past press conference.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the upcoming period gangster action drama is slated to clash at the box office with the Ranveer Singh starrer Dhurandhar 2.</p>

<p><strong>Yash&rsquo;s upcoming film</strong></p>

<p>Yash was last seen in a lead role in KGF: Chapter 2. Directed by Prashanth Neel, the action film was a massive success in theatres and developed a cult-like following.</p>

<p>Nearly four years after its release, the actor will return to the big screen with Toxic. Additionally, he is set to play King Ravana in the upcoming Ranbir Kapoor-led <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/is-ar-rahman-taking-a-40-day-digital-detox-ahead-of-ramayana-event-heres-what-we-know-1400828">Ramayana</a>, which is slated for a Diwali release this year.</p>

The XXX: Return of Xander Cage actor told reporters that Priyanka is not just amazing in the film but also an incredible talent. He further thanked the Isn&#39;t It Romantic actress for being nice to his kids when they were in New York attending the screening.</p>

<p>Talking about The Bluff, the movie also features Karl Urban, Ismael Cruz C&oacute;rdova, Safia Oakley-Green, and Temuera Morrison.

The drop from Monday is around 30-35 per cent, which is on the steeper side of things, as normally it is expected to be around 20 per cent. The absolute number is still higher than what one would normally expect from a Rs. 8 crore Sunday, but that is the doing ofthe &nbsp;BOGO offer, keeping the business elevated.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The six-day running total for the Shahid Kapoor, Tripti Dimri starrer stands at a little under Rs. 40 crore nett. The first week is headed for Rs. 42 crore nett. The film hasn&rsquo;t done much better overseas either, with USD 1.75 million (Rs. 16 crore) approx so far, giving it a worldwide box office gross of Rs. 64 crore approx.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-film-drops-sharply-on-sunday-nets-rs-27-50-cr-first-weekend-in-india-1400782">weekend</a>, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film is now likely to get there, as it is already around Rs. 40 crore. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-continues-to-surprise-on-tuesday-nets-rs-37-cr-in-5-days-1400842">Tuesday</a> briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that. The Wednesday drop has again made that possibility unlikely.</p>

While the stars didn&rsquo;t arrive together, they were papped around the same time at the same location. Later, an invitation card went viral,&nbsp;which mentioned that Vijay and Rashmika are allegedly set to tie the knot on February 26, 2026. According to the card, the celebs are also planning a wedding reception that could take place on March 4, 2026, in Hyderabad from 7 pm onwards.</p>

<p>The card reads, &ldquo;With the love and blessings of our families, Rashmika and I will be getting married on 26.02.26 in a small and intimate ceremony. We warmly invite you to join us and bless us at our Wedding Reception. Wednesday, 04 March 2026 | 7:00 PM onwards. Taj Krishna, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad. We look forward to celebrating together. Warm regards, Vijay (on behalf of Rashmika &amp; myself).&rdquo; Having said that, it remains unclear whether the card is linked to the actors or not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a known fact that the Dear Comrade actors will be keeping the ceremony small and intimate. However, a source close to the stars told India Today that it&rsquo;s going to be a very small guest list. &ldquo;No phones will be allowed. Even the team capturing the wedding has signed the non-disclosure agreement,&rdquo; revealed the insider.</p>

The cop action drama, directed by Abhiraj Minawala, added Rs. 45&nbsp;lakh to the tally on its third Wednesday, bringing the third week&#39;s cume to Rs. 5&nbsp;crore in 6 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The movie will close its third week around&nbsp;Rs. 5.50 crore, which will take its three-week running cume to slightly over Rs 45 crore.&nbsp;The cop action drama will end up surpassing Mardaani 2&#39;s lifetime cume of Rs. 46.30 crore and emerge as the biggest net grosser of the franchise. Based on the current trends, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-recalls-national-award-win-alongside-shah-rukh-khan-hum-dono-bachchon-ke-tarah-the-1400313">Rani Mukerji</a> film is heading for a finish around Rs. 48-50 crore nett.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-starrer-cop-actioner-remains-flat-on-3rd-tuesday-cume-over-rs-44-crore-1400836">Mardaani 3</a> has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

The survival thriller drama collected Rs. 30-35 lakh on Day 6, as per estimates. The running cume of Tu Yaa Main has reached Rs. 4.10 crore nett in 6 days. It is likely to close its opening week around Rs. 4.35 crore to Rs. 4.50 crore nett.&nbsp;</p>

As Priyanka Chopra Jonas plays the co-lead, she recently reacted to working with director SS Rajamouli, calling the film &ldquo;a career-defining moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Priyanka Chopra Jonas raves about Mahesh Babu&rsquo;s Varanasi</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by India Today, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/vin-diesel-praises-priyanka-chopra-jonas-incredible-talent-at-the-bluff-premiere-shes-amazing-in-the-film-1400850">Priyanka Chopra Jonas</a> was spotted at the premiere of her upcoming film The Bluff, in which she stars alongside Karl Urban. At the event, the actress was asked about her upcoming project with SS Rajamouli.</p>

<p>Priyanka said, &ldquo;Well, the filmmaker&#39;s name is SS Rajamouli sir, and he is one of the best that we have in India. His movie is going to be really career-defining for me, I think, and I&#39;m very excited about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from his primary role, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/mahesh-babu-unveils-virat-karnas-mythological-action-film-nagabandhams-teaser-calls-it-absolutely-fascinating-1400801">Mahesh Babu</a> has confirmed that he will also appear as Lord Rama in one of the film&rsquo;s episodes.</p>

<p>With the shoot currently underway, Varanasi is slated to release on April 7, 2027. Earlier, there were speculations that the film would be released as a two-part venture. However, the director has confirmed that it will be a single, massive installment with a runtime of around three hours.</p>

Find out]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/437526047_dhanush-shankar-velpari-webp.webp"></img><p>After the release of films like Indian 2 and Game Changer, director S. Shankar is expected to helm a magnum opus titled Velpari, an adaptation of the novel of the same name.</p>

<p><strong>Is Dhanush being eyed to play a pivotal role in director Shankar&rsquo;s Velpari?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Valai Pechu, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/like-game-of-thrones-or-avatar-shankar-on-his-much-awaited-movie-velpari-rajinikanth-credits-him-for-tamil-cinemas-growth-1393535">Shankar</a> is considering Dhanush for an important role in Velpari. The film is touted to be a massive project mounted on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the director has inquired about the actor&rsquo;s availability, which is said to be the reason he appeared in person for the D55 pooja ceremony. However, the makers have not yet made any official announcement regarding this.</p>

<p>Earlier reports also suggested that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ranveer-singh-to-join-game-changer-director-shankar-in-dream-project-velpari-all-we-know-so-far-1400349">Ranveer Singh</a>&nbsp;and Chiyaan Vikram were being considered for the lead role, though official confirmation is still awaited.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/director-shankar-to-begin-his-magnum-opus-velpari-under-strict-budget-rules-after-game-changers-response-1400288">Velpari</a> is based on the novel Veera Yuga Nayagan Vel Pari by Su Venkatesan. The story narrates how the Chera, Chola, and Pandya empires sought to overthrow the tribal king Vel Paari and the events that followed.</p>

<p><strong>Shankar&rsquo;s previous movie</strong></p>

<p>Shankar last directed the Ram Charan starrer Game Changer. The political action drama revolves around an honest IAS officer who takes on corruption and abuse of power within the political system, locking horns with powerful individuals. During his fight for justice, he also uncovers truths about his past that are connected to present-day events.</p>

<p>Featuring Ram Charan in dual roles, the film also starred Kiara Advani, SJ Suryah, Anjali, Jayaram, and Srikanth in key roles. Game Changer was released in theatres during Sankranti 2025 but received an underwhelming response from both critics and audiences. The film is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Shankar had earlier announced a sequel to Indian 2, titled Indian 3, starring Kamal Haasan. However, there has been no official update regarding its release so far.</p>

<p><strong>Dhanush&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/mrunal-thakur-dismisses-marriage-rumors-with-dhanush-i-think-14th-feb-is-going-to-be-april-fools-day-1400694">Dhanush</a> is next set to appear in the lead role in Kara. Directed by Vignesh Raja, known for Por Thozhil, the thriller will feature Mamitha Baiju as the co-lead, along with Karunas, Suraj Venjaramoodu, and Jayaram in key roles. The film is slated for a summer release this year.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dhanush has also announced that he will appear in the tentatively titled D55. Directed by Rajkumar Periasamy, the project will be bankrolled by the actor himself and will feature Mammootty, Sreeleela, and Sai Pallavi in important roles.</p>

The Spider-Man: Homecoming co-stars have been dating for a long time. And during a recent chat for Interview Magazine with her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-robert-pattinson-engaged-first-look-at-their-sparkling-romance-in-the-drama-1399039">The Drama</a> co-star Robert Pattinson, the actress was quizzed about her red flags, and right as she was speaking, her boyfriend successfully revealed how he passed the test, without even saying a word.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zendaya shares how Tom Holland overcomes a big relationship red flag for her</strong></p>

<p>Talking about the distinction between a real red flag and some things that people can only learn after being with someone, she shared how it&rsquo;s important to her how people treat their crew. Which actors are welcomed on set and said it&rsquo;s telling of people about how they behave when the cameras are not rolling. At the same time, another very important litmus test for the 29-year-old is how people behave with and around animals, as the Euphoria star would surely get into a fight for her pet. She believes that dogs are a good judge of character.</p>

<p>Immediately after, it is noted that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-holland-expresses-his-love-for-zendayas-dog-via-this-heartfelt-gesture-find-out-1366966">her dog</a> barked on seeing Tom Holland, who had returned home, a fact the actress very easily sews into the conversation. And just like that, without even doing or saying anything, her fianc&eacute; is given the clean chit by her excited dog. Robert Pattinson further questions her if she decides someone is good or bad instinctively, within seconds of meeting them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She agrees and disagrees equally, explaining it as, &quot;People are layered and complex, and they make mistakes. There are cultural differences. But there are also things that are just kind of, &#39;Well, that&rsquo;s rude. That&rsquo;s mean.&#39; And there&rsquo;s also the opposite. You can know someone for a long time, and they can change, or you get to know them on a deeper level, and you&rsquo;re like, &#39;Whoa. I didn&rsquo;t see &nbsp;that side of you.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the couple got engaged back in December 2024, making it public during a red carpet appearance in January 2025.&nbsp;</p>

The makers are leaving no stone unturned to make it a great outing during the Eid weekend.</p>

<p>Backed by Jio Studios, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/dhurandhar-the-revenge-ranveer-singh-announces-teaser-release-date-and-time-with-intriguing-poster-1400415">Dhurandhar 2: The Revenge </a>locked the distribution deal with PVR Inox for the four major markets in India. Reportedly, the largest cinema chain will distribute the upcoming spy actioner in Central Provinces &amp; Berar, Central India, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. Interestingly, they also distributed the first part in these Indian territories, including Rajasthan.</p>

<p>The first part was a historic blockbuster, emerging as the highest grossing Hindi film of all time at the Indian box office, with a lifetime cume of around Rs. 787 crore. In fact, the movie is still luring the audience in cinemas on low levels, despite its digital release.</p>

<p>Though the original film didn&rsquo;t release in any other language, it still performed well down South. The upcoming installment will have its Tamil and Telugu-dubbed versions, too, which is expected to boost its sales in these respective markets.</p>

<p>Co-starring Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, R Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, and Sara Arjun, the sequel is clashing with Yash&rsquo;s gangster action drama, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-toxic-hindi-trailer-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-final-update-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-1400833">Toxic</a>.

The couple who dated in the early 2010s and got married, only to split up and then get back together, has seemingly ended things once and for all. Their breakup is not recent, though, as Page Six reported that the couple has been separated for about a year now.</p>

<p>Shia LaBeouf and wife <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/elizabeth-debicki-discusses-her-role-in-maxxxine-and-her-aversion-to-horror-films-details-1323098">Mia Goth</a> have split up, as per the latest reports. The couple seemingly broke up a year ago, and the coverage says it happened &lsquo;nearly a year ago.&rsquo; However, the status of their relationship currently remains unclear, as reports have cited that it is unknown whether the two have filed for a divorce after all.</p>

<p><strong>Mia Goth and Shia LaBeouf&rsquo;s relationship timeline</strong></p>

<p>The duo is infamous for their on-again, off-again relationship ever since they got together back in 2012 when they met while working together on Nymphomaniac. They dated for a while before getting married four years later in a Las Vegas ceremony in October 2016 in a famed USD 700 ceremony that was talked about for days owing to its absolute budgeted expense. They tied the knot at the Viva Las Vegas wedding chapel as a part of its Blue Hawaii package. However, officials later claimed that they were not legally married, but were instead involved in a commitment ceremony.</p>

<p>Their whirlwind romance and follow-up nuptials came to an end as it was reported that the two filed for divorce in September 2018. At the time, it was noted that the separation was &lsquo;amicable&rsquo;. However, it did not last long as the pair was back again, prancing around with matching couple rings in March 2020 in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With more twists and turns in their relationship than one can imagine, they announced that they were expecting their first child by February 2022. Their daughter was born in March 2022 and was named Isabel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of February 2026, it is believed that the two have officially split; however, it is unknown if they were legally married all this time and if they decided to file for divorce once again.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kichcha Sudeep reported to join Varanasi</strong></p>

<p>Amid a lot of speculations surrounding the cast of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-plot-does-mahesh-babu-starrer-revolve-around-a-mans-travel-across-space-and-time-to-save-the-world-1398568">Varanasi</a>, a new report by India Today claims that actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kichcha-sudeeps-52nd-birthday-fans-request-better-poster-designer-for-billa-ranga-baasha-mark-first-look-is-lit-1396359">Kichcha Sudeep</a> has been roped in to play an important role. If it comes true, it would be the third collaboration between the star and the filmmaker, following their joint work briefly on Eega and then on Baahubali: The Beginning. Though his previous appearances were brief, his impact was notable, making this a high possibility.&nbsp;</p>

Directed by Sudha Kongara, the period political drama is set in 1960s Tamil Nadu and follows the story of Chezhaiyan, also known as Che, a young and peace-loving man. He works in the railways, is the sole breadwinner of his family, and takes care of his younger brother, Chinna Durai, a college student and activist.</p>

<p>As civil conflict takes center stage, Chinna actively fights against systemic oppression, even though his brother disagrees with his methods. However, things take a drastic turn when a vicious police officer named Thirunaadan enters the picture. Serving the government, he uses police brutality to curb the protests.</p>

<p>Amid all this, a life-changing event leads Che to undergo a significant transformation, prompting him to stand with the protesters his brother supports. How Che&rsquo;s life evolves over time, his bond with his sibling, and the challenges he faces form the core of the film.</p>

<p>Apart from Sivakarthikeyan, the film also stars Ravi Mohan, Sreeleela, and Atharvaa Murali in pivotal roles. It is currently available for streaming on ZEE5.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Sivakarthikeyan is also set to collaborate with director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/goats-venkat-prabhu-reveals-how-thalapathy-vijay-agreed-to-the-film-based-on-an-idea-i-told-him-first-half-only-1400119">Venkat Prabhu</a> on another project.</p>

Tamil film Soodhu Kavvum is planning its re-release on the upcoming Friday, February 20. It will join Thalapathy Vijay&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/remember-thalapathy-vijay-and-trisha-krishnans-iconic-film-ghilli-heres-where-to-watch-it-online-as-it-marks-21-years-1382966">Ghilli</a> and Ajith Kumar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/exclusive-ajith-kumar-to-wrap-up-thunivu-on-november-29-film-expected-to-release-on-january-11-1200990">Thunivu</a> at the box office for a major battle between three big South Indian film industry stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2013 release ended up as a monumental point in Vijay Sethupathi&rsquo;s career, earning him praise and accolades alike. It also became a crucial release in Ashok Selvan and Ramesh Thilak&rsquo;s filmographies. During its time of release, the film gathered an impressive Rs. 12 crore at the box office estimates, prompting a remake in Telugu called Gaddam Gang in 2015 and one in Urdu in 2018 named Chupan Chupai. It also gave rise to a sequel titled Soodhu Kavvum 2 in 2024, but it did not gain as much traction at the cinema.</p>

<p>Santhosh Narayanan composed the music for the film, Dinesh B Krishnan did the cinematography, and Leo John handled the editing, under the banner of Thirukumaran Entertainment with C V Kumar&rsquo;s production.</p>

<p>The Nalan Kumarasamy directorial&rsquo;s re-release was confirmed by makers Sakthi Film Factory with an announcement on its social media, with tickets priced at just Rs. 100. The original stars Sanchita Shetty, Karunakaran, Bobby Simha, Ramesh Thilak and Ashok Selvan, alongside Vijay Sethupathi in the main role, with Yog Japee, Aruldoss, M S Bhaskar and Radha Ravi, joining.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Soodhu Kavvum</strong></p>

<p>The film, starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-sethupathi-reunites-with-super-deluxe-director-thiagarajan-kumararaja-for-pocket-book-malavika-mohanan-joins-them-1400804">Vijay Sethupathi</a> in the lead role, is a Tamil-language black comedy about Das, who &lsquo;kednaps&rsquo; people with his own set of rules and gets entangled with a bunch of no-goods who end up becoming his assistants. The four cross paths with some influential figures and, in the greed to earn a lot of money, get involved in a big mess. He comes face-to-face with his &lsquo;imaginary&rsquo; girlfriend, as his partners realize that she was very much real after all.</p>

There was a 10 per cent jump from Monday, due to the discount day. That brings its five-day running total to Rs. 37 crore nett approx, with the first week headed for possibly Rs. 44 crore nett.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Considering the film had a surprisingly good hold on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-film-has-a-surprisingly-good-hold-on-monday-nets-rs-32-cr-in-4-days-1400807">Monday</a>, which was largely attributed to the BOGO offer and possible holiday impact in certain pockets, a drop would have been quite normal. As is seen, films with BOGO offers normally don&rsquo;t grow that much on Tuesday, but they also normally don&rsquo;t continue BOGO on Tuesday, as prices are already down, but this film continued BOGO yesterday, so that probably kept it from dropping.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Then, of course, there is said to be feeding involved, and evidently, the ratios at which business is coming are out of the ordinary. The feeding is probably there outside national chains, with the national chain share of business being lower than what would normally be expected from a film like this. Generally, the feeding is more visible in national chains, but here, it&#39;s probably done differently. You have a state like Gujarat outperforming, something you normally don&rsquo;t see with a film like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Basically, the film had a poor/meh trend over the weekend and was essentially left for dead on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-film-drops-sharply-on-sunday-nets-rs-27-50-cr-first-weekend-in-india-1400782">Sunday</a>, but now the film is suddenly trending well on weekdays, which simply doesn&rsquo;t happen. How long this will continue is unknown. For now, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter as the fate of the film remains unchanged. Seems unlikely, but if it continues or increases in the second week, one might have to think about it because then, by box office numbers, the outlook may change.</p>

The cop action drama, directed by Abhiraj Minawala, recorded a jump in business due to the discount day. The running cume of Mardaani 3 has reached Rs. 44.45 crore nett at the Indian box office. It is likely to surpass the Rs. 45 crore by the end of its third week. The cop action drama will end up surpassing Mardaani 2&#39;s Rs. 46.30 crore and emerge as the biggest net grosser of its franchise. Based on the current trends, the Rani Mukerji film is heading for a finish around Rs. 48-50 crore nett.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x. Mardaani 3 has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

<p>Mammootty said, &ldquo;Eyesight and hearing are very important aspects of human life. Even while breathing, some people are unable to smell anything. I was unable to smell or taste anything for a long time. Now, I am slowly regaining it. We only understand the value of such abilities when we lose them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added, &ldquo;When we ask someone to lower the volume or speak in a softer voice, it is because we can hear. People who cannot hear would never say such things. Some people don&rsquo;t even realize the privilege they have in being able to like or dislike a song, while others simply wish to hear something in their lives. Hearing is a godly blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those unaware, Mammootty faced a health scare in 2025 and took a months-long hiatus from acting. While official sources did not confirm the exact details, reports suggested that the superstar had been undergoing cancer treatment and had recovered in time.</p>

<p>After receiving a positive diagnosis, Mammukka officially announced his return to films by rejoining the shoot of Patriot.</p>

<p>Mammootty is next set to appear in the lead role in Patriot, directed by Mahesh Narayanan. The upcoming spy action drama is said to revolve around a controversial intelligence mission.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/drishyam-3-release-date-mohanlal-confirms-georgekutty-to-return-to-the-big-screen-on-april-2-2026-1400777">Mohanlal</a> playing a key role, the film marks the reunion of the stalwarts of Malayalam cinema after a decade. Apart from the two superstars, the movie also features Kunchacko Boban, Fahadh Faasil, Nayanthara, Rajiv Menon, Revathi, and others in key roles. The film is slated to hit the big screens on April 23, 2026.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Mammootty is currently filming the drama <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/mammoottys-upcoming-film-titled-padayaatra-mammukka-and-adoor-gopalakrishnan-reunite-after-32-years-1400140">Padayaatra</a> and is also set to appear in a pivotal role in Dhanush&rsquo;s D55, directed by Rajkumar Periasamy.</p>

Find out]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/553363965_soundarya-rajinikanth-webp.webp"></img><p>Rajinikanth is currently working on Jailer 2, directed by Nelson Dilipkumar. Now, it appears that the actor may already be planning his farewell film, which could be bankrolled by his daughter, Soundarya Rajinikanth.</p>

<p><strong>Is Rajinikanth&rsquo;s farewell movie to be produced by Soundarya?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Valai Pechu, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanth-to-be-paid-rs-225-crore-for-film-with-kamal-haasan-heres-what-we-know-1400696">Rajinikanth</a> is planning to collaborate with his daughter, Soundarya Rajinikanth, on his farewell film. However, the superstar has not yet decided which project will mark the conclusion of his cinematic career.</p>

<p>The report further suggests that he may continue to appear in a few more films after Thalaivar173 with director Cibi Chakravarthy and the tentatively titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanth-x-kamal-haasan-film-to-be-slice-of-life-project-about-friendship-all-we-know-about-its-plot-1400548">Thalaivar174xKH238</a>, which is expected to co-star Kamal Haasan. As of now, these remain rumors, and an official decision is yet to be made.</p>

<p><strong>Rajinikanth&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Rajinikanth will next appear in the lead role in Jailer 2, directed by Nelson Dilipkumar. The film will see Mohanlal and Shiva Rajkumar reprising their roles and will also feature Vidya Balan and Mithun Chakraborty in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>In an earlier interview, Mithun Chakraborty hinted that the film might include a cameo appearance by Shah Rukh Khan. However, the makers have not issued any official confirmation so far. Additionally, actress Nora Fatehi is expected to feature in a special dance number.</p>

<p>While the release date has yet to be announced, the makers are reportedly aiming for a mid-2026 release.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Rajinikanth is expected to begin work on a film tentatively titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/thalaivar-173-rajinikanth-shares-big-update-on-film-with-kamal-haasan-says-its-gonna-be-proper-1399937">Thalaivar173</a>. The project is set to be co-produced by Kamal Haasan under the banner of Raaj Kamal Films International and directed by Cibi Chakravarthy, who is known for Don. The upcoming film is touted to be an action drama, with the superstar reportedly playing the role of a tailor.</p>

<p>Initially, the project was announced with director Sundar C at the helm. However, due to prior commitments, the filmmaker later opted out.</p>

<p>After that, Rajinikanth is expected to collaborate with Kamal Haasan on the big screen. The film is reportedly being helmed by Nelson Dilipkumar and is said to be a slice-of-life drama centered on the story of two friends.</p>

In a recent appearance, the actress recalled a sweet gesture by her co-star, which she said meant a lot to her.</p>

<p><strong>Mamitha Baiju recalls co-star Suriya&rsquo;s sweet gesture during Suriya46 shoot</strong></p>

<p>Speaking at the JFW Awards event, Mamitha Baiju opened up about her experience working with Suriya. She said, &ldquo;Suriya sir and I had such a great time shooting for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/suriya-46-to-hit-big-screens-in-july-or-august-2026-producer-confirms-post-karuppu-release-plans-1400755">Suriya46</a>. He always has this special coffee, which is unbelievably good. I used to quietly ask his assistants what exactly he was drinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moment he found out, he made sure I got the same coffee every single day until the shoot wrapped up. It was a small gesture from him, but it meant a lot to me,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Suriya46 is an upcoming romantic drama starring Suriya and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/amid-jana-nayagan-delay-mamitha-baiju-breaks-silence-on-trolling-over-her-singing-how-people-receive-it-1400542">Mamitha Baiju</a> in the lead roles.

Tu Yaa Main fell a bit short of the Rs. 1 crore low-end forecast, but in the same general vicinity.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With no major release scheduled for March 13, there is no fresh entrant to Pinkvilla Predicts this week. The following week will bring two notable titles, Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic (Hindi), into tracking. With that in mind, Toxic is forecasted a week in advance, and Dhurandhar will be updated next week.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Toxic (Hindi) (19/03/2026)</strong><br />
First Day Box Office Forecast: Rs. 10-15 crore</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Toxic is the first release of Yash, following the blockbuster success of the K.G.F. franchise, which catapulted him to the national stage. The film retains his established mass-hero persona, with shades of his K.G.F. character Rocky, which is a plus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The two promos released so far offer a cocktail of stylised violence and bold sensual imagery. It&rsquo;s been a while since a major film did that, but that tends to do well as far as opening is concerned, especially in smaller centres. Although that may limit its appeal in family audiences, that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue for the opening day.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The film releases on Eid. It&rsquo;s a big holiday, which benefits everywhere, but the muslim mass centres are particularly in overdrive, and the film is going to fare strongly there.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With all these pluses, there is one negative and a BIG one at that. Toxic clashes with what appears to be the biggest Hindi film in recent times, Dhurandhar: The Revenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dhurandhar: The Revenge will be the first preference for exhibitors and audiences on the day, and Toxic will likely suffer in showcasing. While the clash will certainly amplify awareness for Toxic, awareness without adequate showcasing may not fully convert into box office numbers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether the film holds on to this date remains to be seen, but as of today, the clash seems highly likely. With a solo release or even a clash with a lesser film than Dhurandhar: The Revenge, on a major holiday, the film could have made a go at Rs. 20 crore or higher opening day, but in the current scenario, it&#39;s more likely to be around half of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other Updates:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-the-kerala-story-2-goes-beyond-trailer-update-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-1400493"><strong>The Kerala Story 2</strong></a> got a trailer today, and it has been received well, with the promo carrying a strong, impactful tone.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Forecasting remains tricky, as the film&rsquo;s target audience may not be regular cinema-goers, similar to what was seen with The Kerala Story. Another uncertainty is whether the audience turns up on day one or builds over the weekend and weekdays.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the trailer is a clear positive, and the opening day forecast is accordingly revised to Rs. 3&ndash;7 crore, up from Rs. 1&ndash;5 crore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Assi </strong>remains unchanged, while <strong>Do Deewane Seher Mein</strong> is lowered slightly.</p>

Fun On The Run, starring Aasif Sheikh, Shubhangi Atre, Rohitashv Gour, Mukesh Tiwari, Ravi Kishan, and others, failed to strike chords with the audience, despite being a hugely popular show on Television. The comedy drama, directed by Shashank Bali, opened with around Rs. 20 lakh at the box office and went on to close its opening weekend around Rs. 90 lakh. It could further add around Rs. 45 lakh to the tally, wrapping its first week around Rs. 1.35 crore. </p>

<p>Estimates suggest that the movie couldn't do anything significant in the second week so far. Thus, the movie is exhausting its entire box office journey around Rs. 1.50 crore nett at the Indian box office, which is a disastrous result for such a film, which transitioned from the small screen to the big screen. </p>

<p>The box office fate of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bhabhi-ji-ghar-par-hain-final-box-office-collections-aasif-sheikh-and-rohitashv-gour-starrer-ends-theatrical-run-at-rs-1-50-crore-turns-a-disaster-1400831">Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hain! Fun On The Run </a>proves yet again that television popularity doesn't necessarily turn into the footfalls at the box office. Before Aasif Sheikh, Shubhangi Atre, and Rohitashv Gour starrer, another popular TV sitcom, Khichdi, too got its film adaptation. Though it performed well, the overall figure was nowhere near the kind of popularity it had on TV. </p>

<p>Even the biggest star of Indian TV, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/kapil-sharma-net-worth-how-the-multitalented-star-went-from-making-rs-500-to-becoming-indias-comedy-powerhouse-1399092" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hain Box Office Collections: Big on small screen, small on big screen','1400631','https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/kapil-sharma-net-worth-how-the-multitalented-star-went-from-making-rs-500-to-becoming-indias-comedy-powerhouse-1399092','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/bhabhi-ji-ghar-par-hain-box-office-collections-big-on-small-screen-small-on-big-screen-1400631','Kapil Sharma','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Kapil Sharma</a>, also met with back-to-back failures on the silver screen, barring his debut movie. Now, the popular OTT show <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/mirzapur-the-movie-gets-a-release-date-heres-when-can-you-watch-the-film-in-theaters-1400470">Mirzapur </a>is also gearing up for a theatrical film adaptation.

Rapper Responds Post Super Bowl LX Breakup Rumors]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1692507733_cardi-b-stefon-diggs.webp"></img><p>Is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/has-cardi-b-broken-up-with-stefon-diggs-singer-deletes-all-traces-of-boyfriend-amid-offset-drama-1393149">Cardi B</a> back on the market? It seems that the American rapper has split from her baby daddy after all. The rumors of her breakup with NFL player Stefon Diggs have been rampant ever since the two unfollowed each other post Super Bowl LX. Now, during a new appearance, the WAP hitmaker seemingly confirmed that they have ended their relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cardi B addresses Stefon Diggs breakup rumors&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Taking to the stage for her Little Miss Drama Tour&rsquo;s Los Angeles stop on Sunday night, the rapper reacted to the ongoing tensions surrounding her and fellow rapper BIA. She was precise and to the point while responding to the same, saying, &ldquo;Just because I ain&rsquo;t f&ndash;king with my baby daddy doesn&rsquo;t mean you get to talk about my baby daddy.&rdquo; Her comments have essentially confirmed that she and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/cardi-b-confirms-4th-pregnancy-rapper-expecting-first-child-with-nfl-star-stefon-diggs-im-excited-1396946">Stefon Diggs</a>, the father of her fourth child, a son, are no longer dating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This rant comes amid the two unfollowing each other during Super Bowl LX, where the sportsman&rsquo;s team New England Patriots, lost against the Seattle Seahawks with a score of 29-13. The murmurs of their supposed breakup have been rampant on the internet since. Meanwhile, the rapper was spotted exiting the Levi&rsquo;s stadium right after featuring in the Halftime Show headlined by Bad Bunny, where she performed and went back without waiting for the game to finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 33-year-old was previously asked about any words of support for her then-beau ahead of the Super Bowl game, and only managed to mutter a simple &lsquo;Good luck&rsquo;, then walked away. The beef between Cardi B and BIA has been going on for a while, with the former claiming that the latter dissed her children, while the latter accuses her of copying.&nbsp;</p>

With such a good hold, the second week&#39;s cume of With Love reached Rs. 8.75 crore. It is likely to wind around the Rs. 10 crore mark.&nbsp;</p>
