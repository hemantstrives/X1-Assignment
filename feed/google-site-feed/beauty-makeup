<p>Eisha starts her eye makeup after the base is complete. She fills in her brows using an eyebrow gel, giving them a fuller yet natural look.</p>

<p>For the eyeshadow, she picks shades from a&nbsp;nude palette of her choice, mixing matte tones with a bit of glitter to keep it soft and elegant. &ldquo;Wear your makeup with confidence,&rdquo; she advises viewers, reminding them not to be afraid of trying new shades.</p>

<p>She lines her eyes with an eyeliner pen, a product she seems to enjoy for its precision. Then she curls her lashes and applies&nbsp;mascara to lift them. To add even more volume and length, she layers on another mascara.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Blush and Contour</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to blush, Eisha loves a natural flush. She uses liquid blushes in light shades. Using a brush, she gently taps the product into her cheeks. &ldquo;It gives a natural, dewy look,&rdquo; she says. She admits she should have blended her concealer better before applying blush, but that&rsquo;s what makes the video so real and relatable.</p>

<p>For contour, she uses a contour kit to add some definition to her face.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Lips and Final Touch</strong></p>

<p>Eisha keeps her lips simple yet polished. She first moisturizes them with a lip balm, then applies a lip liner and follows it up with her favorite&nbsp;lipstick. To finish the look, she dabs on some compact, which sets the makeup and removes any unwanted shine.</p>

<p><strong>The Final Word: Water and Rest Are Key</strong></p>

<p>Before wrapping up, Eisha Singh gives an important reminder: drink enough water and get proper sleep. These, according to her, are the real secrets to good skin. Makeup can enhance features, but healthy skin is the real foundation.</p>

<p>Throughout the session, Eisha shares small glimpses of her life, like how she often roams around her house while doing makeup. Her laid-back yet knowledgeable approach makes her tutorial not just helpful but also very real. She encourages beginners to try things out, experiment, and see what makes them feel good.</p>

Complimenting her natural skin, the diva kept her brows defined and used a neutral tint on her lips.</p>

<h3><strong>How to get the faux freckles makeup look?</strong></h3>

<p>While freckles are a natural phenomenon, they can be enhanced and more defined on the skin to give that no-makeup bare look. Here are 6 steps to follow to get it done:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Moisturize your face and follow your desired makeup regime.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Take an eyebrow pencil that matches your skin tone and sharpen it to precision.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Start from the bridge of the nose and move towards the cheekbones. Press and twist gently for dots to mark.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Continue the process until fake freckles are placed evenly all around the nose, cheek, forehead, and chin area.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong></p>

<p>Dab in lightly the freckles with your fingertips to blend them nicely within the skin.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong></p>

<p>Finish off with a spritz of setting spray for the freckles to remain firm.</p>

The diva&rsquo;s cute baby bump and glowing skin have gotten all the attention already, as fans cannot stop gushing over the happy news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, did you know the secret behind her everlasting skin glow is because of a simple 5-step routine she swears by? Read on to find out!</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Cleanse gently, moisturize deeply</strong></p>

<p>The first step for Kiara is to use a gentle cleanser to rid her skin of all impurities, including any makeup residue, while keeping the natural barrier of the skin intact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She then follows it up with a good moisturizer, which consists of vitamin E, leaving her skin feeling hydrated and nourished for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Never miss out on sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>Kiara Advani&rsquo;s glow never fades away, even when out in the sun. The reason? Well, the diva does not forget to use a sunscreen that protects her skin from the UV rays and acts as another barrier to avoid pigmentation.</p>

<p>For the actress, a good sunscreen is ideally one with a large SPF spectrum and also has some nourishing properties. It also must not leave a white cast on her face and blend nicely.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Hydration is key&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Throughout her day, Kiara keeps fulfilling the fluid requirements of her body and skin and keeps track of her water intake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While she begins her day with a glass of warm water, she ensures that throughout the rest of the day, she consumes enough fluids (juices, water, etc.) to keep her skin supple, nourished and hydrated.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Don&rsquo;t take makeup to bed</strong></p>

<p>Kiara Advani has been an advocate for minimal makeup trends most of the time. However, once back from work, the first and most important thing for her is to remove all of it before hitting the bed.</p>

<p>Sleeping with makeup is a big no-no for her, as keeping it overnight on her face blocks pores and makes her skin unable to breathe. Finally, she ends her day by applying a generous amount of night cream, which nourishes, repairs and rejuvenates her skin.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Secret hack passed down from her grandmother</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest secrets behind Kiara Advani&rsquo;s all-time glowing skin is a very special hack passed down from her grandmother. Well, ditching store-bought cleansers, the diva trusts the goodness of natural ingredients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She often uses a homemade face pack made of besan, malai, and honey, which forms a thick paste. This helps to give her skin the best detox ever, leaving it feeling refreshed and glowing.&nbsp;</p>

The diva&rsquo;s hair is literal goals as she flaunts long and luscious strands, which can leave anyone smitten. However, such charming hair can&rsquo;t be achieved easily; it&rsquo;s a result of conscious efforts. From being picky about haircare products to following a 6-step hairwash day routine, here&rsquo;s everything Sonam Kapoor does to keep her hair healthy, long, and shiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s haircare ritual&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sonam&rsquo;s haircare routine displays her love for her hair. While you might think it must be high-end and complicated, it&rsquo;s, in fact, quite practical and accessible. Check the process and steps:</p>

<p><strong>1. Shampoo&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sonam Kapoor shampoos her hair twice. This technique is in trend, and more and more people are practicing it. Shampooing twice or double cleansing helps in deep cleaning and getting rid of buildup. And when you&rsquo;re in an industry where your hair constantly goes through all sorts of processes, double cleansing becomes a necessity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Conditioner&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/sonam-kapoor-enjoys-her-week-off-in-abstract-print-taffeta-midi-dress-and-hermes-sling-bag-1384975">The Khoobsrat actress</a> strongly emphasizes conditioning after shampooing. When you&rsquo;re double cleansing, your hair might lose moisture and become dry and frizzy. To replenish the lost moisture and keep your strands smooth and manageable, conditioner is important. Further adding on the technique of applying a conditioner, Kapoor suggests not applying it to the scalp. However, she does apply conditioner from high up, all the way to the ends, thoroughly treating her hair.</p>

<p>PS: The actress suggests towel drying after shampooing and before applying conditioner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Hand perm&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After going through a catastrophic experience with perming on one of her salon visits, Mrs. Ahuja took matters into her hands. She does hand perm, a simple hair styling technique which is in trend. This involves crunching your hair upwards with your hands, after the conditioner, to create a naturally wavy texture.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Serum</strong></p>

<p>Serum is hands down one of Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s favorite haircare products. She towel-dries her hair after washing off the conditioner and then applies serum. Kapoor emphasizes applying serum on the ends as well to lock in the moisture and have a silky and smooth effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Heat protectant&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Being in the showbiz, Sonam&rsquo;s hair go through a lot. To protect them from possible damage, she applies heat protectant as part of haircare ritual. However, things like heat blow drying and UV radiation can also damage hair, making it equally important to apply a heat protectant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. Bow dry or blast dry&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After her hair is ready to take the heat with the heat protectant, Kapoor goes on with blow-dry or blast-dry to style her hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Biggest hair mistake&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>At one time or another, we all have gone crazy with our hair. This includes cutting bangs at home, coloring with no professional guidance, or straightening them until they turn into a broom. For Sonam, it was perming hair. She got her hair permed for a movie often, leading to brutally damaging results. Sharing the regrettable anecdote, Vaayu&rsquo;s mom further mentioned that in such situations, good salon advice is needed. Kapoor revealed that it took her 5 years to regrow and re-strengthen her hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Take professional guidance before going through a hair change to avoid any future oopsies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Obsession with long hair&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/sonam-kapoor-spending-her-week-off-with-vayu-without-distractions-is-major-mother-son-bonding-goals-dont-miss-their-fun-workout-1384965">The Zoya Factor actress</a> has luscious and long hair reaching below her waist. In an interview with Grazia, the style maven opened up about her obsession with extended tresses. She revealed that she has always had long hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has cut her hair only a few times, including for the movies Ayesha and Khoobsurat. However, her hair grows quickly, letting her get into her everyday avatar quite easily. Ditching the trends, she often chooses long hair as her go-to style.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s haircare tips&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Being a hair enthusiast, Sonam Kapoor is always on the lookout for tricks and techniques that would keep her hair strong and luscious. She shared a few haircare tips from her trove of haircare wisdom:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be very careful and mindful about choosing the right haircare products and taking the right advice from professionals.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be aware of your hair problems and take preventative measures at the earliest.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A heat protectant is a must. Especially if your hair goes through constant treatments and exploitation.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consume protein and have a balanced diet that supports hair growth and strengthening.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

Shanaya Kapoor's Goa diaries]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-05/304178175_image-43.jpg"></img><p>Shanaya Kapoor&rsquo;s recent photos from Goa have everyone dreaming of a beach vacation. With her sun-kissed selfies, breezy outfits, and stunning sunset views, it&#39;s easy to see why the beach life looks so tempting. But with all the beauty that comes with coastal getaways, there&rsquo;s one common concern&mdash;sun tanning.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re already imagining your toes in the sand but worried about skin damage, relax. Here&#39;s how you can enjoy the sunshine without bringing back unwanted tan lines, dryness, or breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Start With the Right Sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>This is the golden rule. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 50. Look for UVA and UVB protection. Mineral-based sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are gentler on sensitive skin and work instantly after application.</p>

<p>Apply it 30 minutes before stepping out into the sun, and reapply every 2 hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Don&rsquo;t skip spots like your ears, neck, feet, and the back of your hands.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cover Up With Light Layers</strong></p>

<p>Shanaya&#39;s comfy loungewear and oversized shirts are not just stylish&mdash;they&rsquo;re smart. Loose, cotton, or linen fabrics allow your skin to breathe while shielding it from harsh rays. A full-sleeve shirt, wide-brimmed hat, and UV-protective sunglasses can go a long way in reducing direct exposure.</p>

<p><strong>3. Avoid Peak Sun Hours</strong></p>

<p>The sun is most intense between 10 AM and 4 PM. Plan your beach walks or sunbathing either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Take breaks under umbrellas, beach tents, or shaded spots to give your skin some rest.</p>

<p><strong>4. Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize</strong></p>

<p>Saltwater, sand, and the sun can dry out your skin. Use a light, water-based moisturizer post-shower to restore hydration. For extra nourishment, pack an aloe vera gel&mdash;it soothes sunburns and calms irritated skin.</p>

<p>If your skin feels itchy or tight, apply hydrating sheet masks in the evening. And don&rsquo;t forget your lips&mdash;carry a lip balm with SPF to keep them soft and protected.</p>

<p><strong>5. Stay Hydrated</strong></p>

<p>Shanaya&#39;s Goa food diaries included lots of fruits, and there&rsquo;s a reason why. A fruit-rich diet can boost skin health from within. Add watermelon, oranges, cucumbers, and coconut water to your beach menu. Drink at least 2-3 liters of water daily to keep your skin plump and glowing.</p>

<p><strong>6. Use Physical Barriers on the Beach</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re lounging for hours, consider using a beach mat, towel, or even a portable umbrella to block direct contact with hot sand. Sand can reflect UV rays back onto your skin, increasing the risk of tanning and even sunburn.</p>

<p><strong>7. Use After-Sun Care Products</strong></p>

<p>Once your beach day ends, give your skin some love. Cool showers, gentle exfoliation with a soft scrub, and calming lotions with chamomile or cucumber extracts help your skin recover overnight. Products with vitamin E and antioxidants are also great for reversing early sun damage.</p>

<p><strong>8. Opt for Tinted Moisturizers or BB Creams Instead of Heavy Makeup</strong></p>

<p>Wearing full makeup on the beach can clog pores and cause breakouts. Instead, use a tinted SPF moisturizer or BB cream, especially if you want to even out skin tone. Choose non-comedogenic products that allow your skin to breathe.</p>

<p><strong>9. Take Extra Care of Sensitive Areas</strong></p>

<p>The skin around your eyes is thinner and more prone to sun damage. Wear UV-blocking sunglasses, and if needed, dab a small amount of SPF-infused eye cream around the area. Your scalp is also at risk&mdash;wear a hat or apply a spray sunscreen on your hair parting.</p>

<p><strong>10. Limit Exfoliation Before and During the Trip</strong></p>

<p>Many people think scrubbing off the tan will help. In reality, over-exfoliating can strip away the skin&rsquo;s natural oils and increase sun sensitivity. Exfoliate once a week, not more. Be gentle and follow up with deep moisturization.</p>

<p><strong>11. Choose Your Beach Beauty Products Wisely</strong></p>

<p>When on a coastal trip, switch to oil-free, non-comedogenic, and fragrance-free products. The humid beach climate can trigger breakouts or rashes. Also, avoid using products with retinol, AHAs, or BHAs before sun exposure&mdash;they can make your skin more sensitive to light.</p>

<p>Shanaya Kapoor&rsquo;s sun-kissed Goa vacation photos may make you want to hit the beach right away. And rightly so! But while you&#39;re chasing sunsets and sipping smoothies, don&rsquo;t forget your skin needs a little extra love. From choosing the right SPF to staying hydrated and protected, beach skincare doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated. Just a few thoughtful steps can help you enjoy your getaway glow without the unwanted tan.</p>

While her stunning looks leave everyone in awe, the secret lies in the simple yet essential regimen she follows without fail.</p>

<p>In one of the videos on her YouTube channel, the diva offered a glimpse into the detailed steps of her skincare routine and even listed the products she uses.</p>

<p>Check out the 5 must-have beauty products from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/7-best-korean-skincare-products-to-add-to-your-beauty-routine-alia-bhatt-swears-by-avocado-ceramide-recovery-serum-1387863">Alia Bhatt</a>&rsquo;s vanity that are absolute essentials for a good skincare routine:</p>

<p><strong>1. Jade roller/skin massager</strong></p>

<p>The first step in Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s skincare regime is using a jade roller (also known as a skin massager) across her cheekbones and jawline. It helps calm the skin, boosts blood circulation, and reduces signs of fatigue.</p>

<p><strong>2. Eye cream</strong></p>

<p>Alia works through a hectic schedule which often leads to less sleep. As a result, it causes dark circles, which is where a good under-eye cream comes in handy. It also helps with dryness around the eyes.</p>

<p>She applies the Farmacy Dew It All Total Eye Cream before any other product and allows it to settle down a bit before proceeding with other items.</p>

<p><strong>3. Watermelon glow niacinamide</strong></p>

<p>Alia Bhatt credits niacinamide in her skincare routine for reducing fine lines and protecting skin from pollution. It also helps regenerate and hydrate the skin.</p>

<p>The Raazi actress uses Glow Recipe&rsquo;s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Drops, applying it generously all over her face.</p>

<p><strong>4. Watermelon juice moisturizer</strong></p>

<p>Moisturizing is a non-negotiable step in Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s skincare routine. She generously applies moisturizer to keep her skin hydrated throughout long shooting days.</p>

<p>The diva uses Glow Recipe&rsquo;s Watermelon Juice Moisturizer, applying it all over her face, neck, and hands.</p>

<p><strong>5. Fotoprotector Fusion Water Sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>The final and most crucial step in Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s skincare routine is sunscreen. She advises applying it everywhere&mdash;even indoors&mdash;since harmful sun rays can penetrate and damage the skin.</p>

<p>Alia uses ISDIN&rsquo;s Fotoprotector Fusion Water Sunscreen with broad-spectrum SPF 50, generously applying it all over her face and neck before makeup.</p>

While some go bare-faced, unfazed by the paparazzi clicks, others strive to maintain their glamorous public image. With hectic schedules and back-to-back shoots, beauty hacks become more of a necessity than just fun makeup tricks.</p>

<p>So, B-town glam queens often rely on on-the-go beauty hacks that help them navigate their busy workdays like true divas. What are these beauty secrets that help them transition smoothly from shoot to shoot, looking flawless? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

<p><strong>1. Alia Bhatt&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/alia-bhatt-gets-treated-to-7-course-meal-and-its-not-from-hubby-ranbir-kapoor-hint-she-is-the-apple-of-their-eye-1382703">Alia Bhatt</a> is a true beauty maven, looking stunning with or without makeup. The diva often shares beauty tips that her fans adore, including her &ldquo;tint instead of foundation&rdquo; hack. Alia prefers to skip foundation when off-duty, reserving it for movies and ads, and opts for skin tints instead.</p>

<p>She also reveals she&rsquo;s a bit of a mixologist, experimenting by blending products. Alia mixes a lightweight, sheer skin tint with a primer to create a concoction that blends seamlessly and gives her skin a beautiful glow. This technique is part of her sunburnt look routine. She loves keeping her skin natural, proudly showing off her freckles.</p>

<p><strong>2. Sonam Kapoor&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sonam Kapoor, a style icon and beauty connoisseur, prefers authentic products that are accessible and effective. In a recent vlog, she revealed her unique lip prep secret&mdash;not what you&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<p>Before applying her favorite red lipstick combo, the Zoya Factor actress dabs a tiny amount of coconut oil&mdash;a staple in every Indian household&mdash;on her lips.

According to Adam Schaffner, a Triple Board-certified plastic surgeon, Kim should have opted for safer alternatives. However, Dr. William Bruno feels that it would be unfair to compare her current state to her younger days.</p>

<p>Kim Novak&rsquo;s plastic surgery tells the tale of Hollywood&rsquo;s obsession with toxic beauty standards that push many celebrities to opt for plastic surgeries. Her cosmetic procedures were failed attempts at restoring her youth, which backfired. The saga is not a fancy tale of amplifying youthfulness. Instead, it is a real-life story from which one can learn and take lessons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter how advanced plastic surgeries, facial treatments, and cosmetic alterations are, one should be aware of the results. For Kim Novak, her non-surgical facelift didn&rsquo;t bear fruitful results, affecting her image and career. However, it is commendable how, despite her personal struggles and insecurities, she had the guts to speak about her regrets. Today, she serves as a poignant reminder of the unpredictable nature of such procedures.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Persistent Stains:</strong> If stubborn stains remain even after deep cleaning, the beauty blender may not be as effective.</li>
	<li><strong>Texture Changes:</strong> If the sponge becomes too soft or loses its bounce, it&rsquo;s a sign that it&rsquo;s breaking down and should be replaced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a worn-out beauty blender can lead to less effective makeup application and an increased risk of skin issues, so it&rsquo;s important to replace it regularly.</p>

<p>With our guide on how to wash beauty blenders the right way, you can easily clean the makeup tools without causing many conundrums or failures.

<p style="text-align:justify">Creating slits in eyebrows is a quick and easy process, but there are essential tips and precautions you must keep in mind before going ahead with it.</p>

<p>1. If you pluck your eyebrows too aggressively, you could end up with permanent alopecia and struggle with regrowth forever. So, think twice before picking up those tweezers.</p>

<p>2. Make certain that all tools used during the process are cleansed and disinfected. Refrain from employing razors or electric trimmers that are not your own. This is imperative for safety and hygiene purposes.</p>

<p>3. Be gentle during the process and shave only as much as needed. Overdoing it could lead to an unpleasant result or even cause harm.</p>

<p>4. If you get a cut, ensure to use an antiseptic liquid to avoid any infections.</p>

<p>5. Keep in mind that eyebrow slits are often linked with gang culture and violence. Make sure that the people around you are not offended by this form of self-expression before proceeding.</p>

<p>Eyebrow slits, once exclusive to celebrity culture, are now more popular than ever. The trend may have been popularized by Tom Hardy, Jason Momoa, Lesley Ann Brandt, and Zayn Malik, but it&#39;s up to you to give it your unique twist and make it your own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hesitate any longer now that you know how to do eyebrow slits. Unleash your artistic spirit and make those slits pop! Just remember to be careful when shaping them and avoid using scissors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And if you accidentally shave off a bit too much, fear not! Your trusty eyebrow pencil will come to the rescue, allowing you to easily conceal any unwanted gaps. It&#39;s time to make a dramatic statement with your eyebrows, so go ahead and let your creative juices flow!</p>

This response emphasized the natural changes her body had experienced.</p>

<p>In July 2020, when another hater commented on the size of her breasts, Maren humorously replied, &quot;Don&#39;t let my boobs knock you on the way out,&quot; accompanied by a crying-laughing emoji. This response showcased her ability to stand up for herself while maintaining a sense of humor.</p>

<p>Back in 2017, when a fan suggested that she might have had breast implants, Maren Morris defended herself by stating that she had not undergone surgery to enhance her body. She further challenged the commenter to say the same thing to her face during a meet and greet.</p>

<p>Maren Morris&#39;s consistent and confident responses to body-shaming and plastic surgery claims highlight her resilience and self-assuredness in the face of online negativity and speculation.</p>
