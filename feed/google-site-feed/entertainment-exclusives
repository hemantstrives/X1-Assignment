They are set to return to the silver screen with a highly anticipated horror-comedy project that promises to revive their signature cinematic magic.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Scenes: How the Bhooth Bangla title was finalized by Akshay Kumar</strong></p>

<p>The collaboration was initiated by powerhouse producer Ektaa Kapoor, who personally pitched the script to the duo. Veteran director Priyadarshan immediately saw the story&rsquo;s potential and agreed to come on board after adding a few creative tweaks to the narrative.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-did-arshad-warsi-confirm-akshay-kumars-role-in-golmaal-5-actor-reveals-plans-for-asur-season-3-1400947">Akshay Kumar</a> who made the final call on the film&rsquo;s title, opting to change the original working title to the catchier Bhooth Bangla.</p>

<p>Promising a masterful blend of laugh-out-loud comedy, spine-tingling horror, and gripping thrills, the film is deliberately designed to remind fans of their 2007 cult classic, Bhool Bhulaiyaa. A recently released teaser perfectly captures this energetic vibe, showcasing Akshay Kumar having an absolute blast while navigating the spooky, chaotic antics of a haunted house.</p>

<p><strong>Ektaa Kapoor&#39;s Vision: A &quot;Wild Gujarati Thali&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/heer-ranjha-imtiaz-ali-reunites-with-ektaa-kapoor-for-new-film-expands-laila-majnu-franchise-1400756">Ektaa Kapoor</a>&nbsp;has a specific demographic in mind for this venture: families and children. Drawing personal inspiration from her own child, she wants the film to be an entertaining, shared experience for audiences of all ages. In an informal chat, she enthusiastically described Bhooth Bangla as a &ldquo;wild Gujarati thali&rdquo;&mdash;a rich, vibrant, and varied mix of comedy, horror, and drama that proudly features the &ldquo;OG&rdquo; masters of the genre.</p>

<p>With an ensemble cast that includes Paresh Rawal, Asrani, Rajpal Yadav, Tabu, Mithila Palkar, and Wamiqa Gabbi, Bhooth Bangla is shaping up to be a wild ride. Pritam&rsquo;s music is set to elevate the film&rsquo;s energy.</p>

<p>The first single from the film, titled Ram Ji Aake Bhala Karenge, has already been announced. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bhooth-bangla-akshay-kumar-vidya-balan-send-special-wishes-to-priyadarshan-for-the-film-as-he-turns-69-video-1400330">Bhooth Bangla</a> is officially slated to release in theatres on April 10, 2026.</p>

Arshad said that until Aryan&rsquo;s series came out, no one knew what he was. But now, it&rsquo;s known what he&rsquo;s all about. &ldquo;He is a star without being an actor, and not because he&rsquo;s Shah Rukh&rsquo;s son. At a young age, he has multiple businesses running,&rdquo; he opined.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/shah-rukh-khan-makes-stylish-entry-in-mumbai-with-wife-gauri-and-suhana-khan-after-celebrating-new-year-video-1399607">Suhana Khan</a>, on the other hand, he says, is a sweet kid who is working hard on her big-screen debut film, King. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not an ounce of bad behaviour in both of them. They are bound to succeed. There&rsquo;s too much goodwill going on,&rdquo; he divulged.</p>

<p>When asked about his relationship with Shah Rukh, Arshad was quick to state that the Pathaan actor is a good host and a wonderful human being. &ldquo;He&#39;s one of those guys who has given my profession dignity,&rdquo; stated Arshad, adding that Khan, along with Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, &quot;made us look so good all over the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well-behaved, talented, and well spoken. The whole industry owes it to them,&rdquo; concluded the Golmaal Again star.

Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that the trailer of the Ranveer Singh-led spectacle is slated to drop in the first week of March, around March 5, perfectly setting the stage for its grand Eid release.</p>

<p>According to a source close to the development, Dhurandhar 2 promises to be bigger, grander, and far more intense.&nbsp;&quot;The scale of the second part surpasses the first film in every aspect...from action to emotions&nbsp;and world-building. The team has expanded it like never before, and the trailer will give audiences a solid glimpse into the evolved world of Dhurandhar,&quot; revealed an insider.</p>

<p>The trailer is said to feature brand-new visuals that introduce unexplored territories&nbsp;within the narrative. However, what is truly grabbing attention in early previews is Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s fierce transformation. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-walks-out-of-don-3-amidst-dhurandhar-success-hunt-for-a-new-don-begins-1399363">Ranveer Singh</a> is undoubtedly the highlight of the trailer. His screen presence and physical transformation as Lyari&rsquo;s King is&nbsp;being raved about internally. He brings a certain gravitas&nbsp;that will elevate&nbsp;the sequel to another level,&rdquo; the source added.</p>

<p>Insiders suggest that the trailer cut has been designed massively, without revealing too much of it. With its strategic early-March launch, the makers aim to build&nbsp;momentum&nbsp;for Eid release, positioning Dhurandhar 2 as one of the biggest cinematic events of the year.</p>

<p>If early reactions within the industry are anything to go by, the roar is about to echo louder than ever!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Aditya Dhar, and produced by Jio Studios and B62 Studios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Motwane and Luv Films are keen on mounting the biopic on a grand scale. Shooting at the real locations was always part of the vision. Permissions are being worked out, and the team plans to begin filming in March at various locations like Kolkata, Mumbai and London,&quot;&nbsp;shares a source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajkummar Rao, known for his transformative performances, has already begun prep for the role and is expected to undergo intensive&nbsp;cricket training to embody the former Indian skipper. The film aims to chronicle Ganguly&rsquo;s on-field heroics and lasting impact on Indian cricket.</p>

Initially, the show was planned for a limited run of around 40 episodes. Now, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that the actor&rsquo;s association with the show has been extended by 25 additional episodes. The strong response from audiences has encouraged the makers to expand the season further. The extension signals growing popularity for the game show format and marks another significant milestone for the actor on the small screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Akshay Kumar&#39;s Wheel of Fortune contract extended</strong><br />
<br />
With this development, Wheel of Fortune becomes Akshay Kumar&rsquo;s third successful outing in the television space. While he has long dominated the big screen, his selective appearances on TV have consistently drawn attention and ratings. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-akshay-kumar-reacts-to-similarities-between-khiladi-franchise-and-mission-impossible-i-am-inspired-by-tom-jerry-1391583">The actor</a>&#39;s ability to connect with family audiences through engaging hosting skills and an energetic screen presence has helped the show gain steady traction across demographics. With the extension of his contract, viewers will get to see him for 65 episodes on TV as well as on Sony&#39;s OTT platform Sony Liv.</p>

<p>The success also represents an important achievement for Sony Entertainment Television. After the enduring popularity of Kaun Banega Crorepati, Wheel of Fortune now stands as the channel&rsquo;s second major game show success story.<br />
<br />
<strong>The actor&#39;s previous TV stint</strong><br />
<br />
Akshay&rsquo;s earlier television ventures laid the groundwork for this achievement. He previously impressed viewers as the main host on MasterChef India Season 1 and also as a judge alongside Kunal Kapur and Ajay Chopra. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-akshay-kumar-and-anees-bazmee-team-up-for-family-comedy-film-on-floors-in-feb-2026-1398048">Khiladi Kumar</a> brought his action-hero persona to the stunt-based reality show Fear Factor: Khatron Ke Khiladi in seasons 1, 2, and 4. He is known as the show&#39;s &quot;OG&quot; original host, who popularized the show in India. With Wheel of Fortune now joining that list, the actor has once again demonstrated that his appeal extends well beyond cinema halls, successfully carving out a strong presence on television.</p>

Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that the actor is excited for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-and-jai-mehtas-next-tentatively-titled-pralay-zombie-film-in-post-apocalyptic-world-1397310">Pralay</a>, a high-concept zombie drama set against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, to be directed by Jai Mehta.</p>

<p>Pralay is expected to have&nbsp;large-scale action with strong human emotions, revolving around a family in distress. Being made on Rs 300 crore budget, approx, the film marks the most expensive standalone project of Ranveer&rsquo;s career. While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-yami-gautam-set-to-make-a-cameo-in-aditya-dhars-dhurandhar-2-with-ranveer-singh-1400426">Dhurandhar</a> was mounted on a larger scale, its two-part format split the production costs, making Pralay his biggest single-film investment to date.</p>

<p>A source close to the development reveals, &ldquo;Ranveer has entered into a backend profit-sharing deal and is involved in every stage, from script development to VFX planning. This is also the maiden venture under his production banner, Maa Kasam Films, making it even more special for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We also heard that Pralay&nbsp;will rely heavily on VFX and content equally. In an industry where actors often chase established filmmakers after delivering a blockbuster, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/decoding-economics-of-dhurandhar-ranveer-singh-film-generates-300-crore-profits-1400454">Ranveer Singh</a>&nbsp;has chosen to place his faith in the script, backing Hansal Mehta&rsquo;s son and debutant director Jai Mehta&rsquo;s vision. Pralay is likely to redefine the zombie genre in Indian cinema.</p>

<p>Pralay is set to go on floors from May or June 2026. While there&rsquo;s no official announcement regarding the same, Kalyani Priyadarshan will be seen as the female lead in her Bollywood debut. The zombie thriller focuses on a married couple fighting for survival in a dystopian Mumbai.</p>

Sandhu also talks about whether he is looking forward to expanding the Vadh universe with Vadh 3. In this candid interview, he opens up about the franchise&rsquo;s growth, audience connection, and what lies ahead.</p>

<p><strong>1. Vadh 2 has recorded a nearly 100% jump on Day 3 at the box office, despite several big-ticket films running in theatres. How do you see this reinforcing the belief that content is king, especially in an era where films are succeeding without heavy promotional strategies?</strong></p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s a clear fact that people are liking the film. That means good content is here to stay, and they are recommending the film to other audiences to watch. And I think this is how it should be&mdash;that if a good film is there and word of mouth is able to bring more audiences to the theatres, then even filmmakers gain a certain confidence. We are here to make good cinema, and if we make good cinema, it&rsquo;s here to stay. I mean, making a thriller and setting some benchmarks with the cast&mdash;that not necessarily the hero can only be a 30-year-old, 35-year-old, or 25-year-old. I mean, anybody can be a hero in a given situation. If you&rsquo;re able to make content like that, people are going to watch it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. The climax of Vadh 2 took me by surprise. How did you arrive at such an unpredictable climax, and what was the creative thought process behind structuring it this way?</strong></p>

<p>The main theme has been knowingly kept a low-hanging fruit so that the second climax works like a charm...that was the purpose. I bounced a couple of ideas with Luv, and when this came up, we were happy about it...the intent of the first climax being a low-hanging fruit was to make the second climax work better, and it did.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. The film tackles multiple sensitive themes&mdash;rape, honour killing, morality, and justice&mdash;yet never feels preachy or overly dramatic. How important was it for you to maintain this balance, and what was your approach to layering these messages organically within the narrative?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the film deals with very sensitive themes, but I never wanted the film to become preachy, and I did not want the audience to feel repulsive while watching it. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Given the strong audience response and growing franchise value, are there any discussions or ideas currently in place for Vadh 3?</strong></p>

<p>Vadh 3? So <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/luv-ranjan-exclusive-interview-vadh-2-is-not-a-true-sequel-but-more-of-a-thematic-1400130">Vadh 2</a> happened because we could write a very good story and then a good screenplay, a very tight screenplay that gave us confidence, and we are critics of our own work. So if, going forward, I am able to crack a story that can do justice to both 1 and 2, then why not 3? Content is king, so it&rsquo;s not a pressure, but a responsibility. For&nbsp;me, if I am planning for the third one, the story should move everyone, the screenplay should move everyone, and the film should move everyone. So if we reach there, then why not?</p>

He has again proved his unmatched mass appeal with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/border-2-box-office-collections-sunny-deol-varun-dhawan-diljit-dosanjh-and-ahan-shetty-film-nets-2-75cr-on-3rd-friday-1400533">Border 2</a>.

Decades into his career, Sunny&rsquo;s larger-than-life screen presence and action-hero persona continue to resonate with audiences across generations. Now, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that Sunny Deol is set to team up with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/kill-review-lakshya-unleashes-his-inner-beast-in-the-masterfully-shot-but-thin-plotted-gory-action-drama-1323309">Kill</a> director Nikhil Nagesh Bhatt for his next film.</p>

The narrative is rooted, raw, and real, and audiences will get to see Sunny Deol in a completely new avatar,&rdquo; reveals the source.</p>

<p>Adding to the excitement, insiders suggest that Sunny Deol is thrilled to explore this new world of action under Bhatt&rsquo;s direction. The collaboration will be a fresh take on action cinema + Sunny&rsquo;s iconic mass appeal.</p>

<p>The yet-untitled film will be produced by a leading South Indian studio in association with a prominent Hindi producer. With scale and star power, this Sunny Deol&ndash;Nikhil Nagesh Bhatt collaboration will possibly be one of the most anticipated action films of the coming years.</p>

Dhurandhar: The Revenge has fetched a staggering Rs 245 crore from its non-theatrical rights, setting a new high and underlining the franchise&rsquo;s massive commercial pull.</p>

<p>As per sources close to the development, the digital streaming rights of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-yami-gautam-set-to-make-a-cameo-in-aditya-dhars-dhurandhar-2-with-ranveer-singh-1400426">Dhurandhar 2</a> have been acquired by Jio Hotstar for Rs 150 crore, while the satellite rights (All Languages) have gone to Star Network for Rs 50 crore. Adding further to the deal, the music rights have been picked up by T-Series for Rs 45 crore, taking the overall non-theatrical value of the film to unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>With satellite revenues at a low in recent years, the deal stands as the highest non-theatrical valuation of the period and enters the top non-theatrical deals of all time in Hindi cinema.</p>

<p>For context, the non-theatrical rights of Dhurandhar Part 1 were also sold for a hefty price of around Rs 140 crore. With Dhurandhar 2 clocking Rs 240 crore, the sequel has only doubled. The combined profit for Jio Studios from the two Dhurandhar films is insane, and stay tuned till April when we break down the business model.</p>

<p>Dhurandhar 2 stands tall as a rare success story?</p>

For a very long time, there has been chatter about Farah working on the Main Hoon Na 2 script. Now, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that Main Hoon Na 2 is emerging as the front-runner to be King Khan&rsquo;s next big-screen outing. Sources reveal that conversations between SRK and Farah are&nbsp;going strong, marking what could be their return to collaboration after a long gap.</p>

<p>Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan share a successful history, having delivered some of Hindi cinema&rsquo;s most iconic films together. Their last collaboration was Happy New Year in 2014, which went on to become a box-office success. Before that, Om Shanti Om in 2007, and Main Hoon Na, released in 2004, which set a benchmark&nbsp;as a stylish entertainer, packed with patriotism, action, emotion and humor.</p>

<p>Now, two decades later, Main Hoon Na 2 is taking shape as a big sequel while retaining the soul of the original. According to our sources, &quot;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/farah-khan-recalls-how-a-director-tried-to-hit-on-her-during-a-shoot-he-has-come-into-my-room-to-1398223">Farah Khan</a> has cracked an exciting double-role concept for Shah Rukh Khan, which has excited the superstar. The idea is said to elevate the emotion and entertainment quotient of the sequel, while SRK will explore two contrasting characters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The film will be a patriotism galore, with the original cast returning. The central theme revolves around a new threat to India, and the narrative will balance action with comedy. Interestingly, the core story idea has come from Shah Rukh Khan himself,&quot; the&nbsp;source confirms, adding further that the idea is being developed into a screenplay by Aakash Kaushik.</p>

<p>The sequel is expected to retain the DNA of the first film and Farah Khan&rsquo;s signature humor. We also heard, alongside the new faces,&nbsp;the makers are keen on bringing back some actors&nbsp;from the original, adding nostalgia value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While timelines are being worked out around <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/exclusive-shah-rukh-khan-and-siddharth-anands-king-spikes-huge-demand-for-india-distributor-gets-an-offer-of-rs-200-crore-advance-1400456">Shah Rukh Khan</a>&rsquo;s packed schedule post-King, insiders suggest that Main Hoon Na 2 has clearly moved ahead in priority. If things fall into place, the film could mark a celebratory reunion of Shah Rukh Khan and Farah Khan.</p>

<p>&quot;Shah Rukh Khan is expected to hear the complete narration of Main Hoon Na 2 after wrapping up the shoot of King around May 2026. He will take a call on the project post the narration, while the writing process continues in full swing,&quot; adds the source.&nbsp;</p>

Having said that, most sets that I&#39;ve worked on, I&#39;ve really been nurtured. 98% of the incredible directors that I&#39;ve worked with have just been amazing with me. And, but I do believe it&#39;s each to their own, and you need to look out for what, how you are giving your best.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a little five-year-old greedy kid inside of me who wants the experiences. Also, as somebody who&#39;s not from the industry, I have waited for my wishlist directors to find me, for me to be directed by them. As somebody from the outside, even after the commercial success, I&#39;ve had to wait for my next film. And that&#39;s not a complaint. It&#39;s a fact. I&#39;m used to it. So I&#39;m fine with it. But then when I do get that opportunity, I really savor it, and I really enjoy it. So I&#39;m at that phase. I don&#39;t know when that will change.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any methods for taking care of yourself, any skin prep, or morning routines?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aditi Rao Hydari:</strong> I listen to my body and my skin, and like I&#39;m very instinctive. I think my mother has fooled me into believing many healthy things are very delicious. And since I was a little kid, she would give me all kinds of things like jeera paani. And it just became a part of my everyday. So that kind of self-care I do. But as Siddharth says, I think my superpower is that I, and I believe that his superpower is that we can just be five-year-olds and we&#39;re not overthinking things. I rely on gharelu nuske (home remedies), and I listen to my body.</p>

<p>And I need Siddharth. Siddharth is like an energy shot for me. Every so often, I&#39;m just like, this is necessary. Because we are also constantly working, right? So when I&#39;m with Siddharth, I get some of my vitamins and fuel.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Would you say that post marriage, taking care of each other has changed in any way?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aditi Rao Hydari: </strong>No, we take care of each other the way we always have. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any difference.&nbsp;</p>

The silent film, which has finally found its way to the viewers on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/gandhi-talks-teaser-out-vijay-sethupathi-and-aditi-rao-hydaris-silent-film-locks-january-30-release-date-1399617">January 30, 2026</a>, stars Vijay Sethupathi, Arvind Swamy, Aditi Rao Hydari, and Siddharth Jadhav, with Kishor Pandurang Belekar at the helm. The film places two men at starkly different positions in life, and how money rules their choices, affection not just for them but also for those around them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aditi essays the character of Gayatri, the neighbor of Mahadev (Vijay), whom he is in love with, but cannot win over. Meanwhile, Arvid portrays Boseman, an originally successful businessman whose empire nears collapse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with us, actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/aditi-rao-hydari-wears-sindoor-and-red-saree-as-she-flaunts-new-bride-energy-at-cannes-2025-1388788">Aditi Rao Hydari</a> shed light on the &lsquo;deep&rsquo; nature of Gandhi Talks and working with some greats in the industry, as well as her maneuver to a silent film amid contributions to many industries.</p>

<p><strong>How did Gandhi Talks come about, and what was it like working with Vijay Sethupathi and Arvind Swami?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aditi Rao Hydari:</strong> When this came to me, I was really excited. I didn&#39;t know the concept. I just knew that it was a silent film, so I was dying to do the narration. So I heard it, and conceptually, of course, it&#39;s quite deep. But it was told in a kind of satirical, kind of like a dark comedy vibe. But it has a lot of depth, and it&#39;s a comment on society. And I found that very relevant.</p>

<p>A director&#39;s vision and their obsession with their film is very infectious for me, which Kishore sir had, because he&#39;d worked many years on this. And then the fact that there was Vijay Sethupathi, Arvind Swami, and of course, Rahman sir doing the music. Vijay Sethupathi, I&#39;ve almost done three films with, and none of them worked out. So this was one [I got to do with him]. It was a lot of fun. And I was really looking forward to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arvind sir, I&#39;ve worked with him in one of Mani sir&#39;s films, and he&#39;s really like family. But I didn&#39;t work at all with Arvind sir in this film. I was really looking forward to it. And now that the film is out, and I&#39;m hearing people&#39;s reactions, I&#39;m like, &#39;it&#39;s gotten through to people.</p>

<p><strong>Having worked across Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam industries and now coming in with a silent film, how differently did you approach this film?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Aditi Rao Hydari: </strong>Just now, I&#39;ve been stationed in Bombay (Mumbai) and working on Hindi stuff, but I do miss working in the other languages with the other directors. And when I was doing films in other languages, people would ask me, how is it different? The difference is only in the person who is the captain of the ship, that is, the director. So [it&rsquo;s about] how that director runs the set because cinema is about feeling. And I feel doing a silent film has reiterated that to me even more, that it&#39;s not even Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, or Marathi, it&#39;s no language. It&#39;s just your heart, your heartbeat, your feeling, your body language, your action, your eyes, [and] your face.</p>

<p>No boundary, no difference, no language, no caste, creed, religion, nothing. It&#39;s about human beings. It&#39;s about their dreams, their aspirations, their hopes, their lives.&nbsp;And I think that&#39;s what unites everybody, what you feel from your heart, yeah. And the love and whatever you give from your heart.</p>

The first film, directed by Pavan Kirpalani, starred Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor as quirky ghost hunters alongside Jacqueline Fernandez and Yami Gautam. Bhoot Police found its audience on OTT, especially for its light-hearted take on the horror-comedy genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-bhoot-police-2-in-the-making-priyadarshan-to-helm-this-ramesh-taurani-and-akshai-puri-project-with-a-new-star-cast-1398427">Bhoot Police 2</a> is officially in development, and&nbsp;acclaimed filmmaker Priyadarshan has been onboarded to direct the sequel.

<p>A little birdie also told us, &ldquo;While the sequel retains the core idea of a horror-comedy, the casting will see a complete refresh. Saif Ali Khan and Arjun Kapoor will not be returning for the second installment. Instead, the makers are planning to introduce a new pairing that can bring a fresh energy to the franchise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea is to reinvent the franchise with a new duo. The makers are looking at two actors &mdash; one senior and one junior to create an interesting combo.

<p>The film is expected to go on floors by the end of the year, once the casting is locked and pre-production is wrapped up.

While the buzz around Don 3&nbsp;continues after Ranveer Singh&#39;s exit, the filmmaker-actor is in no hurry to rush the casting process and wants to ensure the iconic franchise gets the right face to carry the legacy forward.</p>

<p>A source close to the development reveals to&nbsp;us, &quot;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sunny-deol-and-jyotika-collaborate-for-farhan-akhtar-ar-murugadoss-new-project-shoot-begins-from-february-2026-1400196">Farhan</a> feels the casting of Don is crucial. He wants to be absolutely sure about who steps into the role, and it is a longer process.&quot;&nbsp;With that decision,&nbsp;Farhan has now reinitiated conversations around <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/katrina-kaif-and-vicky-kaushal-share-first-pic-with-son-name-their-baby-boy-vihaan-kaushal-1399721">Katrina Kaif</a>, Alia Bhatt and Priyanka Chopra Jonas starrer Jee Le Zaraa,&nbsp;a film that everyone has been eagerly awaiting since its announcement.</p>

<p>&quot;Jee Le Zaraa has always been special for Farhan. With Don 3 taking time at the casting stage, he felt this was the right moment to revive discussions with the original team and push the film forward,&quot;&nbsp;the source adds.</p>

<p>The script for Jee Le Zaraa is already locked, and the delay so far has largely been due to logistical challenges and date alignments of all three lead actresses. &ldquo;If the dates align, the film could finally go on floors in the second half of 2026. Creatively, everything is in place, and&nbsp;it&rsquo;s now about managing schedules,&quot; the source adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farhan has begun fresh conversations with the leading ladies Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranbir-kapoor-alia-bhatt-and-vicky-kaushals-love-and-war-pushed-to-2027-sanjay-leela-bhansali-to-wrap-shoot-in-june-1400028">Alia Bhatt</a>. &quot;Farhan has started discussions with all three actresses and is hopeful their timelines can align. Everyone is keen, it&rsquo;s just about finding that common window,&rdquo;&nbsp;an insider confirms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jee Le Zaraa has long been a passion project for Excel Entertainment and Tiger Baby, also seen as the final chapter in their trilogy of slice-of-life friendship films, following the much-loved Dil Chahta Hai and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.</p>

<p>If things fall into place, Jee Le Zaraa&nbsp;may finally see the light of day, much to the excitement of fans who have been waiting patiently for this ambitious reunion. Interestingly, the road-trip drama will also reunite&nbsp;the much-loved Dil Chahta Hai&nbsp;trio,&nbsp;Farhan Akhtar, Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>New Tune Calling!!</strong></p>

<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a goodbye, folks; it&rsquo;s a hello to a new chapter in his life: filmmaking.</p>

<p>He cited a desire to explore new creative horizons as the reason behind his retirement from singing.

<p>His debut Hindi film will feature Nawazuddin Siddiqui&rsquo;s daughter, Shora, and Arijit&rsquo;s son in lead roles. The jungle adventure film is co-produced by Arijit and his wife, Koel Singh, along with Mahavir Jain.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t Arijit&rsquo;s first foray into filmmaking. He previously directed a Bengali film, Sa (2018), which revolved around a young boy&rsquo;s musical journey.</p>

<p>As Arijit Singh embarks on this new path, fans and the industry alike are eager to see what he brings to the table.

In an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kartik-aaryan-and-luv-ranjan-reunite-after-success-of-pyaar-ka-punchnama-franchise-sonu-ke-titu-ki-sweety-1397204?amp">Luv Ranjan</a> not only talked about the difference between his directorial picks versus production projects, but also shared insights on his upcoming slate of releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Excerpts from the interview:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Every filmmaker craves a signature style, and you clearly have one. Whenever we think of a quirky, modern rom-com, your name immediately comes to mind. Does it come naturally to you?</strong></p>

<p>I am genuinely telling you, I have no idea. When I started in this industry, it was not like I decided that I was going to be a filmmaker who would have a signature with quirky rom-coms. Sometimes, what happens is that you can&#39;t determine your journey. You set out to do something, and your journey takes form.&nbsp;My second film, Akash Vani, if it had done well at the box office, maybe I would have ventured more towards dramas. So, now no one can tell when that journey will turn and in which direction. It just so happened that you know, I ended up doing rom coms and comedies and quirky comedies, and they resonated with the audiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, we are talking about me having a signature in terms of rom-coms and comedies. But if you ask me, was it intentional? It wasn&#39;t intentional. It wasn&#39;t something that I decided beforehand, that this is the path I&#39;m going to take and this is the journey I&#39;m going to take.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Out of all your directorial films, I feel Akash Vaani is the most underrated and isn&rsquo;t talked about much. Do you think if the film were released today, it would be better accepted by audiences? Haven&#39;t you thought of re-releasing it?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I would like to believe that. Yeah, maine kabhi socha nahi uss direction mein. But now that you are saying that maybe I will give it a thought that we should think of re-releasing it, probably.</p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a clear difference between the kind of films you direct and the ones you produce. How do you pick and choose to be involved as a producer or director?</strong></p>

<p>See, because before being a producer and a director, I&#39;m an audience. I love films. And I love all kinds of films. Right, it&#39;s not like I only like comedies as an audience. I grew up on different kinds of cinema. I&#39;m a fan of different kinds of cinema and different genres. Now, the whole idea of being a producer is also about the fact that as a producer, you can venture into different territories. Why should we limit ourselves to making films that I can make?&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, the fun is to be able to produce films and be a part of films that may not be entirely my cup of tea, as a creator. But as long as they are my cup of tea as an audience, as long as it&#39;s a film that I would like to watch, it&#39;s a film that I would like to make in whatever capacity that I can.</p>

As the movie gears up to hit the big screens, Pinkvilla has learned an exclusive and exciting detail about one of the film&rsquo;s major action set pieces.</p>

Starring Sanjay Mishra and Neena Gupta in the lead roles, the film is a sequel to the 2022 release Vadh, which was well received by audiences for its intense premise and powerful performances. Promising to raise the intensity further, Vadh 2 is also expected to deliver a similar experience. As the anticipation around the release builds, producer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kartik-aaryan-and-luv-ranjan-reunite-after-success-of-pyaar-ka-punchnama-franchise-sonu-ke-titu-ki-sweety-1397204"><strong>Luv Ranjan</strong></a> spoke exclusively to Pinkvilla, sharing some intriguing insights into the film and its world.</p>

<p><strong><em>Excerpts from the interview:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Vadh was a chilling film, and Sanjay Mishra&rsquo;s casting came as a surprise. What was the thought process behind choosing him for this role?</strong></p>

<p>When you have an actor who has an image, you know what to expect. Right? Vadh, as a film and now as a franchise, is about a common man who you don&#39;t expect to go a certain distance in terms of when pushed against the wall.... and when he does it, you don&#39;t know what to expect. And that&#39;s the fun of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is Vadh 2 a continuation of the first film&rsquo;s story? What can we expect from the sequel?</strong></p>

<p>It is not a true sequel. It doesn&#39;t start from where part one ended. It&#39;s more of a thematic sequel, and we haven&#39;t basically touched the grain of the film. The grain is the same, the strata are the same. They&#39;re different characters, but their ideology is the same. For example, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/de-de-pyaar-de-2-final-box-office-ajay-devgns-rom-com-exhausts-theatrical-run-at-underwhelming-rs-70-crore-1399749"><strong>De De Pyaar De 2</strong></a> was a true sequel. Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 was a thematic sequel.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When will the Vadh 2 trailer be released?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The trailer is releasing in the theaters with Border 2. Digitally, it&#39;s going to be released on the 27th of this month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other than Sanjay Mishra and Neena Gupta, who else is in the cast of the film?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sanjay Mishra and Neena Gupta are the faces of the franchise. We have a very talented cast in the second one, also. Kumud Mishra is there. He is there in an extremely pivotal part. Then, we are also introducing a few younger actors, newer actors, extremely talented ones- Amitt K. Singh, Akshay Dogra, Yogita&nbsp;Bihani, and then there is Shilpa Shukla, again, in a very pivotal, very interesting role. So it&#39;s a great ensemble cast.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do you think Vadh can also spin into a franchise like Drishyam over time if it gets the kind of reception and reach Drishyam received?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/drishyam-3-release-date-ajay-devgns-crime-drama-to-hit-screens-on-october-2-2026-final-chapter-teased-1399335"><strong>Drishyam</strong></a> is a far bigger franchise, and it is a true franchise. If you see Drishyam 2, it&#39;s a continuation of part one. I believe part 3 will also be a continuation. I&#39;m not sure, because I&#39;m not the maker of that film. But that is a different kind of franchise. It&#39;s a far bigger franchise. It&#39;s a far more successful franchise. And who wouldn&#39;t want to? As a producer, I would definitely want Vadh to be an extremely successful franchise, but that&#39;s something for the audiences to decide.&nbsp;</p>

Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that West is set to visit India in April 2026 for a massive concert tour, marking the first time the artist will visit the country for performing. This will be a major milestone as West is one of the most influential figures in contemporary music. The songwriter and record producer&#39;s potential India tour could become one of the most talked‑about concert events of the year.</p>

<p><strong>What is Kanye West known for?</strong><br />
<br />
Kanye West is known for his work in hip‑hop, rap, gospel and experimental genres. West has pushed musical boundaries, and has also made a mark in fashion alongside his music. West has won 24 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most decorated hip‑hop artists in Grammy history. Some of his most famous tracks are Gold Digger, Stronger, Good Life, Ultralight Beam, among others.</p>

<p><strong>West&#39;s previous visits to India</strong><br />
<br />
Although this would be West&rsquo;s first official tour stop in India, he has previously visited the country under different circumstances. Reports suggest that in 2009 he came to India for a spiritual retreat, including a stay at an ashram, and in 2012 he visited Mumbai to promote his women&rsquo;s fashion label, staying at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.</p>

<p><strong>International stars who performed in India</strong><br />
<br />
Artists and bands such as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-dakota-johnson-break-up-with-chris-martin-because-he-wouldnt-set-wedding-date-source-claims-1391200">Coldplay</a>, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/ed-sheeran-takes-jab-at-professional-singers-for-lip-syncing-their-live-performances-they-dont-admit-it-though-1395216">Ed Sheeran</a>, Dua Lipa, Maroon 5, Backstreet Boys, Akon, Demi Lovato, and Justin Bieber have performed in the country in recent years, either through standalone concerts or major festivals, drawing huge crowds. Global music festivals like Lollapalooza India have brought artists such as Shawn Mendes, Green Day, Jonas Brothers and Louis Tomlinson to perform here, highlighting the demand for international live music in the country.</p>

A couple of days ago,&nbsp;the release date for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/spirit-release-date-prabhas-and-sandeep-reddy-vangas-cop-action-drama-to-hit-screens-on-march-5-2027-1399970">Spirit</a> was announced. Shah Rukh Khan starrer King is getting slated for a Christmas release, with an official announcement expected shortly. And now, there is a significant update on Love And War, starring Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal. The Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial will now arrive in cinemas in 2027 instead of its earlier presumed release this year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The sources close to the production reveal that a significant portion of the shoot is still pending. This has led makers to rework the film&rsquo;s timeline. The current plan is to wrap principal photography by June, after which the film will enter an extensive post-production phase. A big reason for the shift is simply the scale of the film. Love And War includes massive aerial action sequences that demand heavy VFX work, and those visuals take time to get right. Given <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sanjay-leela-bhansali-takes-ranbir-kapoor-alia-bhatt-vicky-kaushal-to-sicily-for-love-wars-climax-1396399">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>&rsquo;s reputation for visual grandeur and detailing, the post-production process was never going to be rushed, which effectively rules out a 2026 release.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The other key consideration behind the decision is the timing.&nbsp;Ranbir Kapoor&#39;s other mega-budget venture, Ramayana: Part One, is slated to release in November 2026. A release in 2026 would have placed the two films too close to each other. The makers are keen to space out the two tentpole releases, keeping a&nbsp;healthy gap between the two&nbsp;and understandably so. This will ensure that each film gets adequate breathing space and focused marketing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With the shoot now slated to conclude in June and post-production stretching well into the rear end of the year, industry insiders suggest that a January (Republic Day) or February (Valentine&#39;s Day) 2027 release is now likely if not almost certain. While the delay extends the wait, it also underlines the makers&rsquo; intent to deliver a visually and technically grand cinematic experience.</p>

However, Pinkvilla has exclusively learned that Akshaye is NOT shooting for any scenes. While the actor is very much a part of the highly anticipated sequel, there is no fresh shoot involving him currently underway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to our sources, Akshaye Khanna&rsquo;s presence in Dhurandhar 2 will be limited to a couple of flashback scenes, which were shot during the film&rsquo;s initial schedules. &ldquo;There is no additional filming happening with Akshaye Khanna at the moment. His portions were wrapped earlier and are part of key flashback moments in the narrative,&rdquo; a source clarified, putting speculation to rest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, work on Dhurandhar 2 has entered a crucial post-production phase. Director Aditya Dhar is presently locked in on cutting the film&rsquo;s trailer. Yes, the makers are aiming for trailer release by the end of February. &ldquo;Aditya is sitting on the trailer edit. The idea is to deliver something impactful again,&rdquo; an insider revealed.</p>

<p>Adding to this, the source revealed, &ldquo;Shashwat Sachdev has simultaneously begun work on the film&rsquo;s background score. Both sound and visuals are being treated as top priority.&rdquo; No stone is being left unturned as the team gears up for Dhurandhar 2 release in cinemas on March 19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the phenomenal success of Dhurandhar, the first part of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/dhurandhar-2-release-date-ranveer-singh-and-aditya-dhar-film-locks-eid-2026-set-to-clash-with-toxic-and-dhamaal-4-1398945">Ranveer Singh</a> starrer emerged as a box-office juggernaut, posting extraordinary numbers and cementing its place among the biggest hits of 2025. Its record-breaking run has raised audience expectations for the sequel.</p>

<p>With Dhurandhar 2 now shaping up rapidly behind the scenes, Jio Studios and B62 Studios are setting the stage for one of the most-awaited releases of 2026. Produced by Jyoti Deshpande, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyadarshan-lauds-his-disciple-aditya-dhar-for-dhurandhars-mega-success-latter-bows-down-to-his-master-1399761">Aditya Dhar</a>, and Lokesh Dhar under Jio Studios and B62 Studios, the part one Dhurandhar featured Ranveer Singh, Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, R.

This has led to a lot of excitement and anticipation among fans. Slated for a theatrical release next month on February 13, 2026, the film is already being described by insiders as one of the most daring and emotionally charged projects of both Shahid and Vishal&#39;s careers. Now, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/throwback-dyk-shahid-kapoors-kabir-singh-was-first-offered-to-ranveer-singh-who-rejected-it-because-it-was-too-dark-1399600">Shahid Kapoor</a> will appear in a striking, never-seen-before avatar for the film.</p>

<p>According to the sources, he highly talented actor will be seen sporting a full body tattoo for the visionary filmmaker&#39;s movie. This radical transformation is said to be central to his character&rsquo;s identity and psychological depth, marking a first-of-its-kind look not only for the actor but also possibly for the Indian cinema as a whole. The sources revealed the physical transformation demanded intense preparation, with the creative team paying meticulous attention to the tattoo&rsquo;s design, placement, and narrative relevance. The look is reportedly not cosmetic but deeply embedded into the story, reflecting the character&rsquo;s inner turmoil, rage, and emotional scars.</p>

<p>Those familiar with the project describe O Romeo as Shahid Kapoor and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shahid-kapoor-vishal-bhardwaj-and-sajid-nadiadwala-join-hands-for-an-action-thriller-1340883">Vishal Bhardwaj</a>&rsquo;s most ambitious and intense collaboration to date. Every department, from performance and aesthetics to storytelling, is said to be operating at peak precision. The actor-director duo, known for pushing boundaries in films like Haider and Kaminey, is reportedly leaving no stone unturned to deliver a cinematic experience that is raw, unsettling, and unforgettable.</p>

<p>With its courageous creative choices and a fearless central performance, O Romeo is shaping up to be far more than a conventional release. As anticipation continues to build, all eyes are going to be on Shahid Kapoor&rsquo;s dramatic transformation and what promises to be one of the most audacious roles of his career.</p>

The discussions are still at an initial stage. According to sources close to the development, the project in question is an action-comedy, a genre that aligns well with Salman Khan&rsquo;s on and offscreen persona while also offering a fresh touch under Raj &amp; DK&rsquo;s style. We heard that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/raj-nidimorus-net-worth-everything-about-the-family-man-director-whos-linked-up-with-samantha-ruth-prabhu-1393261">Raj </a>&amp; DK are keen to mount the film on a big scale if the collaboration materialises.</p>

<p>A source informs Pinkvilla, &ldquo;Salman Khan has heard the basic idea and has shown interest in it. It&rsquo;s an action-comedy, but it will also present Khan in a slightly different space. However, he is yet to give his final nod to the project.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The source further adds that timelines are being discussed, keeping Salman&rsquo;s packed slate in mind. &ldquo;If everything falls into place and Salman comes on board, the makers are looking to take the film on floors by the end of 2026. At the moment, it&rsquo;s all about aligning creatively and locking the script.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ikkis-screening-salman-khan-gets-emotional-after-seeing-dharmendras-poster-rekha-kisses-agastya-nandas-photo-1399494">Salman Khan</a>, a film with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/the-family-man-season-3-review-manoj-bajpayee-starrer-is-brilliant-take-on-spy-actioners-packed-with-impressive-thrills-1398609">The Family Man</a> makers Raj &amp; DK could offer audiences a new flavour of mass entertainment. However, only time will tell what&rsquo;s in store for the audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For now, the project remains in the discussion stage, and an official confirmation will only come once Salman Khan gives his go-ahead. Until then, we will have to wait and watch how these promising talks shape up in the months ahead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Salman Khan is busy with his upcoming film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/battle-of-galwan-teaser-salman-khan-steps-into-shoes-of-colonel-santosh-babu-wins-hearts-with-his-power-packed-soldier-avatar-1399452">Battle Of Galwan</a>, directed by Apoorva Lakhia and produced by Salman Khan under the banner Salman Khan Films.

The actor gave a career-defining performance in Neeraj Ghaywan&#39;s Homebound. In an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, the young talent shed light on meeting legendary Martin Scorsese and talked about how he is taking in all the love and appreciation for the film. The actor also shared about working with Megastar Salman Khan, with whom he shared the screen space in Tiger 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>(Excerpts from the interview)&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>How are you feeling about Homebound being selected as India&rsquo;s official entry at the Oscars and meeting Martin Scorsese?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The moment the news of our official entry to the Oscars and the shortlisting of our movie came, we were very very happy. But at the same time, we were not able to process it. The entire team was celebrating; we were congratulating each other, but it took me at least 2 to 3 days to accept that Homebound had been selected as India&#39;s official entry to the Oscars. So, this is a very blessed feeling, to be very honest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meeting <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/how-did-martin-scorseses-bang-on-advice-help-neeraj-ghaywan-with-homebounds-screenplay-find-out-1389055">Martin Scorsese</a> is like a lifetime memory. I know all of us were very nervous, very quiet before his arrival. We were ready to welcome him; he had kept the room empty and came from behind, and we all went to meet him. First of all, we sent Neeraj (Neeraj Ghaywan) sir, to talk to him. Then, within a second, we were called to meet him.</p>

<p>At most, Martin Sir was telling his stories. We were listening to him. We enjoyed it a lot. It was very nice to sit in front of a legendary director like Martin Scorsese, and just listen to him and have some words. To understand that his eyes are on us, he saw our film, he liked our work; it was a big thing for us.</p>

<p><strong>From starting your career in TV and then transitioning to films. How do you look at your journey so far?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I go on my journey, sometimes I feel very inspired. I have seen a lot of magic in my life. A lot of impossible things that I used to think about, will I ever be able to reach here or not? It used to seem impossible. Sometimes, I used to feel that I had chosen such a difficult industry. But now I see that all this has really happened. I really feel like I am living my dream.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes, I feel like I am living in my dream. Sometimes, I feel like I am getting more than what I deserve, more than what I have desired in my life. So, I am very happy. And I have noticed that everyone who has seen this dream for me, their dream is being fulfilled, not mine.</p>

<p><strong>Was there any scene of you in Homebound that didn&#39;t make it to the final cut, and you regret it?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t regret any scene. All the things that we had shot, a lot of things have been cut. Because a film needs to have a certain duration.</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t regret it. But there were some scenes with Janhvi, which were very beautiful. There was a scene with my mom. It was a very emotional scene. It didn&#39;t make it. And there were a lot of other montages of mine with Ishan that didn&#39;t make it to the final cut. I don&#39;t regret it. Because, finally, we are serving the film.</p>

<p>If there is nothing in the benefit of the film, it&#39;s okay. Like, Neeraj Sir, Ishaan, we all say, k*ll your darlings. So, they have k*lled their darlings, because we could make a good film. And I think that is the reason why so many people like the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Which one was the most difficult scene for you to shoot for Homebound?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Homebound. So, there is a scene, which is more difficult for me. I think there are two or three. But, the most difficult scene, I think, was where I came to the recruitment officer, and sat. And he keeps me in a spot, where I don&#39;t have any escape.</p>

<p>And Chandan Kumar is afraid to say his full name. Because he is afraid that if he keeps his identity in front of people, then people will misbehave with him. Or will behave in a particular way. So, this was a difficult scene. And this was also very difficult, because the first scene, which we started shooting for the film, was the first scene I shot for Homebound. So, I think, this was a difficult scene.</p>

<p>And in the climax, actually, slowly, gradually, increasing my illness, slowly, gradually, and getting it to a point, that was difficult. It was sunny. And there were a lot of things. So, performing, shaking hands, there were a lot of things. But, yeah, I count that also as a difficult scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Which one is closer to you, Mardani 2 or Homebound?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Wow. My God. No. I can&#39;t answer this. Every character, every film is special. Every film has given something different. No, I don&#39;t have an answer to this. I will never be able to choose one of the two. I don&#39;t know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will look biased if I take the name of one of the two. And tomorrow when I wake up, I think my take will change again. So, I don&#39;t want to answer this. Sorry.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How was it working with Salman Khan in Tiger 3? Can you share any memories from the set?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-salman-khan-in-advanced-talks-with-mahesh-narayanan-for-a-period-thriller-1395061\">Salman Khan</a>&#39;s aura. I just love watching him as a fan that whenever Salman sir arrives, he is accompanied by his team. He has a childlike innocence and meets everybody warmly on the sets. I like that a lot. He is very sweet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I remember one memory. Normally, Salman Khan wants to be seen shirtless. It&#39;s a thing. He takes off his shirt anywhere out of confidence. And when he was on our set, I had a scene going on and he had to change. So, he didn&#39;t go to vanity. He just asked his dressman to bring that shirt there only. So, he brought it. And as soon as he brought it, he changed his shirt in front of everyone. And I thought, wow! I saw that scene live.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Have things changed for you in terms of offers after the success of Homebound?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Yes, yes, yes. I started getting a lot of different kinds of films that were not coming out till now. In the same genre, you feel like, What should I do now? You don&#39;t want to be in the same genre always. You don&#39;t want to do the same kind of work.</p>

<p>But the kind of script I am reading now is a little different from what I did before. So, yes. Homebound&#39;s success has given me a lot of things. It has given me a very good position. It has given me success in my career. It has given me a name. It has given me good offers. And <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/homebound-review-ishaan-khatter-and-vishal-jethwa-punch-your-gut-with-neeraj-ghaywans-direction-1397035">Homebound </a>will always be a memorable film in my life. Because of so many reasons.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s next after Homebound? Have you signed anything fresh that you can share with us?</strong></p>

<p>I cannot share right now. But yes, I am in the process of signing something. I am in between that. And I already shot a few things before Homebound. So, maybe that will be released very soon. In 2026, I hope so.</p>

But it seems her personal life might be hitting equally high notes. Nora has found herself at the center of a romance speculation after being spotted in the company of one of football&#39;s most celebrated footballers. A little birdie told us; whispers have reached a fever pitch as Nora has made a special trip to Morocco to attend the Afcon 2025 football game. Clearly, she was there for reasons more than her love for the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source confirms that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/nora-fatehi-gives-health-update-after-her-car-accident-calls-it-scary-terrifying-traumatic-moment-1399311">Nora </a>is attending the game, and the observers have connected the dots. The rumour mills started when they were spotted out and about in Dubai and now in Morocco, which has set tongues wagging. Sources hint that both parties value their privacy immensely, especially Nora, who is particularly keen on focusing on her work commitments.</p>

<p>Recently, Nora teased her upcoming single at Sunburn Festival in Mumbai at <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/what-happened-to-nora-fatehi-on-her-way-to-david-guettas-concert-all-we-know-about-car-accident-1399309">David Guetta</a>&#39;s concert. The much-awaited musical banger will be a collaboration between Nora Fatehi, David Guetta and American singer Ciara. Interestingly, the musical track will also include Nora&#39;s vocals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than her upcoming global single, Nora Fatehi is likely to make her debut in South cinema soon. The actress has played a pivotal role in the Kannada film KD: The Devil. Reportedly, the actress is also playing one of the female leads in Raghava Lawrence starrer horror-comedy film, Kanchana 4, along with Pooja Hegde.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, Nora is also rumored to be doing a special dance number in Rajinikanth starrer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/is-shah-rukh-khan-a-part-of-rajinikanths-jailer-2-mithun-chakraborty-drops-a-big-hint-1399403">Jailer 2</a>. She was recently seen sharing a video about wrapping up a shoot after several days of filming; however, it remains unclear whether it was for Jailer 2.</p>

Actor and filmmaker Jugal Hansraj recently sat down for an exclusive conversation with Pinkvilla, where he reflected on his journey in cinema. He spoke about beginning his career as a child actor in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/padma-awards-2025-arijit-singh-receives-padma-shri-award-shekhar-kapur-and-other-bollywood-celebs-also-get-honored-by-president-murmu-in-delhi-1384869">Shekhar Kapur</a>&rsquo;s Masoom and fondly recalled his early projects. Hansraj also opened up about transitioning into adult roles, facing repeated rejections, and navigating career lows while surviving the tough phase in the Hindi film industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/ibrahim-ali-khans-onscreen-dad-from-nadaaniyan-jugal-hansraj-reveals-young-actors-best-qualities-amid-criticism-and-we-are-in-awe-1388965">Jugal Hansraj</a> revealed how there was a shortage of work after debuting as an adult in the 1994 film, Aa Gale Lag Jaa. He said, &quot;This has been constant in my career as there would be a commitment, but later the film would get shelved. It happened with big producers of that time.&quot; The actor disclosed how it also happened with a couple of films which were to be helmed by him. Hansraj further said, &quot;When I was young, I was heartbroken due to it. But I couldn&#39;t get angry as nobody was doing it on purpose. The circumstances were beyond control. Then what can you do? You just move on.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked about how <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/spotlight-exclusive-mohabbatein-fame-jugal-hansraj-reveals-40-films-didnt-take-initially-it-affected-me">Jugal</a>&nbsp;survived the tough phase in the industry, the actor said, &quot;I had a very strong support system. My family consisted of my parents, my older brother. Now only my big brother is there, but he is still a constant source of support! I also had some friends who would always encourage me. So if you have a good support system and little bit level head, otherwise it can affect you. Too much success can affect you and too much this can also affect you. So I think it&#39;s best to take both with a pinch of salt as part of life.&quot;</p>

Jugal admitted, &ldquo;Baad mein pata laga that it was part of her process that she didn&rsquo;t want us to become close because vo coldness jo hai vo screen pe dikhni chahiye. Sabko pata chala ke ek discomfort hai mujhme aur maa mein bhi. Toh vo both khoorsurati se unhoney kiya tha.&rdquo; (I later got to know that it was part of her process, and she didn&#39;t want us to become close because the audience should feel the coldness between us on the screen. Everyone was able to see the discomfort between the two characters, Indu Malhotra (played by Shabana Azmi) and Rahul Malhotra (played by young Jugal Hansraj). That she did beautifully.)</p>

The living legend reflected on his breakthroughs and the passion that continues to drive him. He spoke at length about memorable collaborations with Subhash Ghai and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/from-richest-person-to-even-god-gets-reviewed-so-who-am-i-ar-rahman-on-his-divorce-with-saira-banu-1384220">A.R. Rahman</a>, and his experiences lending his voice to films featuring Shah Rukh Khan. Sukhwinder also shared heartfelt memories of working with lyricists Gulzar and the late Anand Bakshi who helped to shape the Hindi film music.</p>

<p><strong>On working with Subhash Ghai</strong></p>

<p>When asked about his experience of working with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/subhash-ghai-drops-big-update-on-sanjay-dutt-and-madhuri-dixits-khal-nayak-sequel-and-we-bet-youre-going-to-love-it-1389434">Subhash Ghai</a>, Singh mentioned he has worked with him on Taal, Kisna, and even composed music for Black &amp; White starring Anil Kapoor. While discussing the classic track Ramta Jogi, the singer revealed that the song was made after the film was completed. He mentioned that once Subhash Ghai called him to have dinner. Ghai often addressed him as Ramta. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/top-7-diwali-themed-bollywood-songs-to-light-up-your-playlist-galaan-goodiyaan-kala-chashma-and-more-1397768">Sukhwinder Singh</a> said, &quot;AR Rahman heard the filmmaker address him by that name 4-5 times, which piqued his interest. He asked me what it means? I said it means &#39;freakout person&#39;. A person who cares so much for love. The person who cares so much for their partner.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How Ramta Jogi came about</strong></p>

<p>Singh further emphasized to Rahman that the love is between the God and the person. He said I told him, &quot;Ramta&#39;s real name was Rehmat, who was in love with God, and now, he&#39;s known as Rehmat not Ramta which means God&#39;s blessings.&quot; Rahman told him to incorporate that and Singh crooned Ramta Jogi. He said, &quot;The musician then sent that CD to Lyricist Anand Bakshi sahab and even Subhash ji was not aware of it, but liked it instantly. Rahman is a very good technician. He captured the best thing that I was singing randomly in the most natural way.&quot; Subhash Ghai then told Sukhwinder Singh that the film was about to release as the prints were made, but he requested him to keep the track as he knew it would work. The song matched with Anil Kapoor&#39;s character and was then included in the film.</p>

This will mark their fourth collaboration and is one of the most awaited projects following their earlier blockbuster hits like Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, Julayi, S/O Satyamurthy, and more. &ldquo;The upcoming film will be mounted on a never-before-seen scale, with a massive budget of over Rs 1000 crore,&rdquo; an insider confirms.</p>

<p>A source close to the development reveals, &ldquo;This ambitious project is based on a strong story that was originally written for Allu Arjun and has generated tremendous excitement among fans and the film fraternity. It is expected to blend powerful storytelling with grand visuals, redefining the mythological genre for a pan-Indian and global audience. The film is scheduled to go on floors in February 2027. Before that, Allu Arjun is expected to complete the shoot and release of Atlee&rsquo;s film.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/exclusive-allu-arjuns-film-with-trivikram-to-go-on-floors-in-2025-actor-to-do-one-more-movie-after-pushpa-2-1242331">Allu Arjun&ndash;Trivikram</a> combination has always been a treat for audiences, and fans of both the actor and the director are eagerly awaiting this much-talked-about project.</p>

<p>For the unversed, interestingly, this is the same story that was initially planned for Allu Arjun before it went to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/allu-arjun-out-jr-ntr-in-heres-everything-you-want-to-know-about-trivikram-srinivas-project-1391168">Jr. NTR</a>. Now, the project appears to have come full circle, with an official announcement expected in the next few weeks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Allu Arjun is busy with Atlee&rsquo;s big-budget pan-India film, tentatively titled AA22xA6. The movie is expected to be a large-scale sci-fi action entertainer with international-level visuals and extensive use of VFX.</p>

<p>Given its massive scale and detailed storytelling, the makers are reportedly considering releasing it in two parts. If this plan materializes, the first part could hit screens in late 2026, followed by the sequel at a later date. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/atlee-drops-major-update-on-deepika-padukone-allu-arjun-starrer-aa22xa6s-location-pic-1396668">Deepika Padukone</a>&nbsp;has been cast as the female lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Directed by Aditya Dhar, Dhurandhar is steadily marching towards the Rs 600 crore nett mark, a milestone it is expected to reach by Thursday. With the New Year holidays boosting footfall, the film&rsquo;s 4th week is also projected to be massive, and it could come close to the Rs 700 crore nett mark by the end of its run. The film continues to remain unstoppable at the box office. Amidst this success, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that Ranveer Singh has decided to step away from Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani&rsquo;s much-anticipated Don 3.</p>

<p>A source close to the development revealed, &ldquo;With Dhurandhar&rsquo;s massive success, Ranveer is very clear about the kind of films he wants to do next. He is keen to collaborate with filmmakers like Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Lokesh Kanagaraj, and Atlee, and at the same time, he doesn&rsquo;t want to be seen in back-to-back gangster films, especially since <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/dhurandhar-box-office-collections-ranveer-singh-film-takes-third-week-record-in-four-days-1399360">Dhurandhar</a> is already established in that space. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons he has asked Jai Mehta to prepone the shoot of Pralay. Ranveer is keen on fast-tracking the project and bringing it on floors sooner than planned.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tentatively titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-and-jai-mehtas-next-tentatively-titled-pralay-zombie-film-in-post-apocalyptic-world-1397310">Pralay</a>, the Applause Entertainment-backed film is zombie-based and tells a human story about how far a man will go to save his family in the most difficult circumstances. &ldquo;Now that he has prioritised&nbsp;other projects over Don 3, Singh is now personally involved in aligning dates and schedules for Jai Mehta&#39;s film to ensure the film moves quickly,&rdquo; the source adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coming back to Don 3, an insider confirms, &ldquo;Right after the release of Dhurandhar, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sandeep-reddy-vanga-says-ranveer-singh-and-akshaye-khanna-erased-into-air-in-dhurandhar-the-depiction-is-very-1399292">Ranveer</a> was scheduled to begin preparations for Don 3. However, given the current situation, the film is now pushed&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Farhan Akhtar and the team behind Don 3 have already locked Kriti Sanon as the female lead of the action thriller. The film is expected to be mounted on a grand scale and will be shot extensively across multiple locations in Europe.</p>

Loved for his performance in Kantara: Chapter 1 and Perfect Family, the talented actor will now be seen in a Netflix show, Legacy. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/gulshan-devaiah-claims-anurag-kashyap-is-taking-their-jobs-and-admits-hes-so-full-of-himself-find-out-why-1380269">Gulshan </a>exclusively spoke to Pinkvilla and shared how his character in Legacy differs from what he played in Dahaad. The actor also shed light on working with Samantha in a new Telugu movie, Maa Inti Bangaram.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>(Excerpts from the interview)&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>1. How do you look at box office validation for your films?</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely empowering in terms of the career, profile &amp; remuneration, but I&#39;m careful not to take it too seriously. It can mess with the head if taken too seriously. Hit flop is part of an actor&#39;s life.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Kantara marked your debut in the South, and now you have a couple of projects there. Do you notice any differences between film sets in the South and those in Hindi cinema?</strong></p>

<p>Apart from minor technical things, there is no real stark difference, but I have only worked on 2 projects now, so I can&rsquo;t claim to understand the differences, if any.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Between physical and mental preparation, which was more challenging for you while getting into the role of Kulashekara in Kantara?</strong></p>

<p>The only challenge was to ride the horse. I did 5 classes, 2 hrs a day &amp; only focused on what I exactly do with the horse. Fortunately, I got to train with the same horse, Azaad, who was a real cutie. It can be tricky controlling a horse in a chaotic environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. You are playing a cop in Legacy. How is this character different from Inspector Devi Lal Singh in Dahaad?</strong></p>

<p>A cop is a job &amp; not a personality type. Timeline, age, cultural background, education, outlook on life, sense of duty, relationship with family&hellip; everything is different in Legacy from Devilal Singh in Dahaad.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. How was your experience shooting with Samantha in Maa Inti Bangaram? Is actor Samantha different from producer Samantha?</strong></p>

<p>I have great chemistry with Sam (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/video-samantha-ruth-prabhu-struggles-to-reach-her-car-after-being-mobbed-by-fans-at-a-launch-event-1399320">Samantha Ruth Prabhu</a>). She&rsquo;s just the actor on set, and that&rsquo;s all we get to see. I&rsquo;m really enjoying myself.

As we earlier reported, the 3 Idiots sequel is officially in the works, with the script locked and filming slated to begin in 2026 under the direction of Rajkumar Hirani.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An insider confirms, &ldquo;The script is currently being developed under a tentative working title, 4 Idiots. While this title is still subject to change, the makers are looking out for a superstar to expand the iconic franchise beyond its original trio. The makers are actively searching for a fourth idiot, could be a superstar name.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The writing process is underway, and the team is making sure it gets bigger and better and continues from where it was left in the first part. Yet, this isn&rsquo;t just a simple continuation but will also be introducing new elements to justify the addition of a fourth core character,&rdquo; the source adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While original cast members <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-3-idiots-and-pk-aamir-khan-and-rajkumar-hirani-in-discussion-for-their-third-collaboration-1387460">Aamir Khan</a>, R. Madhavan, Sharman Joshi, and Kareena Kapoor Khan are expected to reprise their roles from the 2009 blockbuster, speculation around the &ldquo;fourth idiot&rdquo; is set to raise curiosity soon among the moviegoers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4 Idiots is a working title only and may or may not change later. Nevertheless, the very discussion of a fourth lead, potentially a superstar, will be a bold move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Released in 2009, 3 Idiots went on to become a cult classic, sparking nationwide conversations about India&rsquo;s education system. The film also created history as the first Indian movie to cross the Rs 200-crore mark, setting new benchmarks for Bollywood then. The sequel will be directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-aamir-khan-brainstorms-10-scripts-before-closing-a-deal-with-rajkumar-hirani-pk-2-also-in-the-discussion-1390527">Rajkumar Hirani</a>, with Vidhu Vinod Chopra backing the project alongside Hirani and Aamir Khan.</p>

Directed by Nelson Dilipkumar, Jailer became one of Kollywood&#39;s biggest films ever. After the massive success of the first part, the makers are now all set to take things to the next level with Jailer 2. Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vidya-balan-recalls-losing-out-on-8-9-films-in-south-after-being-considered-a-jinx-in-mohanlals-shelved-movie-1393348">Vidya Balan </a>has officially joined the cast of Jailer 2, adding more to the sequel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source close to the development confirms, &ldquo;Vidya Balan recently signed on for Jailer 2 and was completely impressed by the script. Her character is important to the story as she plays a strong, layered role, bringing a major turning point in the film. Her presence will add intensity, making her one of the important characters&nbsp;of Jailer 2.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A little birdie also confirms that the makers are planning a grand theatrical release on August 14, 2026, aiming to cash in on the holiday weekend. However, it is still discussion. Interestingly, the first part of Jailer was also released in August and went on to set box office records. With a powerful cast,&nbsp;and high expectations, Jailer 2 is shaping up to be bigger and more explosive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Directed by Nelson Dilipkumar and produced by Sun Pictures, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/jailer-2-vinayakan-confirms-being-part-of-rajinikanth-film-mohanlal-jets-off-to-sets-after-drishyam-3-wrap-up-1398879">Jailer 2</a> will see Rajinikanth reprising his iconic role as Tiger Muthuvel Pandian. Cameo appearances from Mohanlal, Shiva Rajkumar, Nandamuri Balakrishna, and Mithun Chakraborty will add that&nbsp;pan-Indian appeal to&nbsp;the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jailer 2 shooting began on 10 March 2025 in Chennai and has progressed through schedules in Palakkad and Goa, with major action sequences filmed and more scenes planned through December 2025.&nbsp;Muthuvel Pandian&#39;s journey continues in the sequel, which is reportedly set to feature him facing vastly greater threats and delivering on the promise of intense action and bloodshed.&nbsp;</p>

Day by day, the spy action thriller is creating a new record at the box office. The film also stars Rakesh Bedi in a pivotal role. The veteran actor sat down with Pinkvilla and spoke at length about his experience of working with the entire team.</p>

<p><strong>On working with Ranveer Singh</strong><br />
Rakesh Bedi among his other experiences also mentioned about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singhs-dhurandhar-to-have-4-minute-post-credit-scene-runtime-longer-than-animal-1398871">Ranveer Singh</a>. He said, &ldquo;This is my very first film with him. I am a massive fan of Ranveer Singh. I have been a fan ever since he entered the film industry. For a simple reason because that man has the guts to pull off each and every single kind of a role. He makes sure to go into a zone that actors avoid going to in order to prepare. People often feel it is just a phase as once you get good dialogues to say and action sequences to perform that is more than enough to be seen on the big screen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further went on to say, &ldquo;Ranveer Singh has experimented with his acting on such a high level. The two-three films that he did with Sanjay Leela Bhansali are fantastic films. In Dil Dhadakne Do as well, he had acted so well, despite being one of the several characters. So it takes a lot of inner courage do these roles with full energy. In acting, it is the &#39;energy&#39; which is the main ingredient as that helps you to function with full power.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>About Dhurandhar</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/dhurandhar-box-office-collectionsranveer-singh-film-doubles-it-opening-day-on-second-friday-1399113">Dhurandhar</a> is a Hindi spy action-thriller directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/dhurandhar-movie-review-dont-let-runtime-fool-you-aditya-dhar-fires-up-a-crackling-ranveer-akshaye-showdown-1398944">Aditya Dhar</a>. The film is positioned as a high-octane, espionage-driven drama with a strong emotional core, blending intense action with layered storytelling, something Dhar is known for. The film is headlined by Ranveer Singh, who is said to be stepping into a powerful, rugged avatar unlike his recent roles. Dhurandhar also boasts an ensemble cast featuring Sanjay Dutt, Rakesh Bedi, Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, and Sara Arjun bringing together performers known for their gravitas and screen presence.</p>

The much-awaited war action drama, starring Sunny Deol, Varun Dhawan, Diljit Dosanjh, and Ahan Shetty, is slated to hit the big screen on January 23, 2026, coinciding with Republic Day weekend. The makers have already started their promotional campaign by dropping first look posters of each prominent character from the film. And now, we have exclusively learnt about an exciting update on its big teaser reveal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source close to the development revealed that the much-awaited teaser of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/border-2-exclusive-varun-dhawans-much-awaited-first-look-to-drop-on-november-5-1398179">Border 2 </a>will be released on December 16, 2025, in Mumbai, in the presence of the cast and crew. This teaser launch date holds immense significance as December 16 is celebrated as Vijay Diwas in the memory of India&#39;s big win during the 1971 war against Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The source confirmed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sunny-deol-joins-forces-with-excel-entertainment-on-a-big-action-thriller-filming-begins-in-december-1394780">Sunny Deol</a>, Varun Dhawan, and Ahan Shetty will be available during the teaser launch.

The much-awaited film will mark the reunion of Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, and will be directed by Rajkumar Hirani, with Vidhu Vinod Chopra backing the project alongside Hirani and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/aamir-khan-says-superhero-film-with-lokesh-kanagaraj-is-on-the-cards-well-go-through-the-narration-1398983">Aamir Khan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source close to the development revealed that the sequel will go on floors in the second half of 2026. &ldquo;The script has been locked, and the team is extremely excited for it. They feel the magic of the first film has returned, and is as funny, as emotional, and as meaningful as the first part,&rdquo; an insider confirms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story will be a continuation, picking up nearly 15 years after the characters went their separate ways in the climax scene and reunite for a new adventure,&rdquo; adds the source. Well, the audience will get to see the nostalgic charm of Rancho, Farhan, Raju and Pia&nbsp;with new humour that will reflect their grown-up journeys.</p>

<p>A little birdie told us, Rajkumar Hirani, who had long toyed with the idea of a sequel, found the right moment to revisit it only recently after his Dadasaheb Phalke biopic went on hold. &quot;He dedicated time to expand the 3 Idiots sequel into a full-fledged screenplay. Hirani always had a seed of an idea for 3 Idiots 2, but he wanted it to be perfect and something that would stand up to the legacy of the original,&rdquo; the source revealed.</p>

<p>Released in 2009, 3 Idiots became a cult classic and initiated discussion on India&rsquo;s education system. It also made history as the first Indian film to enter the Rs 200-crore club, setting new benchmarks for Bollywood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the dream team, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/fitness/kareena-kapoors-secret-to-ageing-gracefully-at-70-ghee-khichdi-no-skin-treatments-and-botox-1396232">Kareena</a>, Aamir Khan and others reuniting for the much-awaited story that promises both nostalgia and freshness, 3 Idiots 2 is already one of the most anticipated films of the decade.</p>

<p>On a related note,&nbsp;Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani have reportedly put their Dadasaheb Phalke biopic on hold for now because they are not happy with the script.</p>

As the actress gears up for more cinematic ventures, it was expected that she might headline director Lijo Jose Pellissery&#39;s Bollywood debut film.</p>

<p>However, Pinkvilla has exclusively learned that the young actress has declined to headline the movie despite being interested in the script.</p>

<p>According to a close source, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/rasha-thadani-is-in-her-sheher-ki-ladki-era-as-she-glams-up-in-a-budget-friendly-bodycon-black-dress-for-her-birthday-1377826">Rasha Thadani</a> was among the first choices to star in the romantic drama film. However, due to her upcoming projects, her busy schedule has forced her to opt out of the project directed by Pellissery and produced by Hansal Mehta.</p>

<p>The source explained, &ldquo;Rasha was the top contender for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-hansal-mehta-recalls-anurag-kashyap-saying-uske-liye-ek-rupaya-nahi-mil-raha-for-rajkummar-rao-reveals-he-didnt-want-to-meet-him-for-shahid-1382742">Hansal Mehta</a> and Lijo Jose Pellissery&#39;s upcoming romantic drama. The film, which was announced in October, has been the talk of the town, and while Rasha was approached by the makers, unfortunately there is a date clash due to which she is not able to take on a script she truly loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, the source added that the shoot for her next release, Laikey Laikaa, has been delayed, requiring her to spend even more time completing her portions. After wrapping up the film, Rasha will begin work on her South debut, co-starring with Mahesh Babu&#39;s nephew Jaya Krishna Ghattamaneni.</p>

<p>For those unaware, director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/malaikottai-vaaliban-movie-review-mohanlal-lijo-jose-pellissery-collab-is-technically-brilliant-film-that-goes-on-for-too-long-1273851">Lijo Jose Pellissery</a> announced his Bollywood debut a couple of months ago. After helming the Mohanlal-starrer Malaikottai Vaaliban, the filmmaker will now direct a romantic drama co-produced by himself and Hansal Mehta under the banners Amen Movie Monastery and True Story Films.</p>

<p>Written by LJP and Karan Vyas, the movie is touted to be a lyrical exploration of love, longing, and the fragile complexities of human connection. The romantic drama will have music composed by AR Rahman.</p>

<p>While the cast is yet to be confirmed, reports suggest that either Rajkumar Hirani&#39;s son Vir Hirani or late Shashi Kapoor&#39;s grandson and actor Zahan Kapoor may play the lead.</p>

<p><strong>Rasha Thadani&rsquo;s upcoming films</strong></p>

<p>After making her debut in Azad, Rasha Thadani will next appear in Laikey Laikaa, co-starring Munjya fame Abhay Verma, which is touted to be a romantic film.</p>

<p>Additionally, she will soon make her debut in Telugu cinema with the tentatively titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/raveena-tandons-daughter-rasha-thadani-to-make-telugu-debut-opposite-mahesh-babus-nephew-jaya-krishna-ghattamaneni-1398492">AB4</a>, directed by RX100 fame Ajay Bhupathi and presented by Kalki 2898 AD producer Ashwini Dutt.</p>

The spy action drama, directed by Aditya Dhar, is finally releasing this Friday. Pinkvilla earlier reported that Dhurandhar will be a two-part story, of which the sequel is scheduled for a Summer 2026 release. And now, we have exclusively learnt about a big surprise that will keep the audience intrigued for the second installment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source close to the development revealed that the Ranveer Singh starrer will have a 4-minute-long post-credits scene. This special sequence will act as a teaser of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-dhurandhar-2-to-release-in-summer-2026-ranveer-singh-starrer-becomes-a-franchise-1398509">Dhurandhar 2</a>, which is designed to take the excitement among the audience for the sequel a notch higher. The makers are still looking at multiple release options for the second part. However, there is a possibility that this exciting post-credit scene might also reveal the release date of Dhurandhar 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ranveer Singh starrer received an &lsquo;A&rsquo; certificate, meaning only those above 18+ are eligible to watch the film. The approved runtime of Dhurandhar is 214.1 minutes, which is 3 hours and 34 minutes. The movie has not only turned out to be the lengthiest film of Ranveer Singh&#39;s career but also one of the lengthiest Indian films in recent years. For the record, Dhurandhar is longer than Ranbir Kapoor&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ranveer-singhs-dhurandhar-compared-to-ranbir-kapoors-animal-netizens-say-teasing-box-office-rampage-1393039">Animal</a> and Allu Arjun&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pushpa-2-worldwide-closing-box-office-allu-arjuns-mega-blockbuster-is-biggest-grosser-in-india-1370224">Pushpa 2: The Rule</a>. While the Sandeep Reddy Vanga-directed film has a runtime of 3 hours and 21 minutes, the latter was approved with a runtime of 3 hours and 20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Dhurandhar Pre-Sales</strong></p>

<p>Set for a grand release on December 5, 2025, Dhurandhar is registering good pre-sales in the advance booking. Its opening day figure will depend on how it records sales in the last few days and then on the spot bookings in the mass centres.&nbsp;Besides Ranveer Singh, the spy action drama also stars an ensemble cast that includes Sanjay Dutt, R Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Akshaye Khanna, and Sara Arjun.&nbsp;</p>

Now, the director is set to return to the genre with a mythological comedy venture starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/manoj-bajpayee-confirms-the-family-man-season-4-after-latest-edition-ended-on-cliffhanger-says-jaldi-milte-hain-1398657">Manoj Bajpayee</a> and Rajkummar Rao in the lead roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source confirms, &ldquo;Director Shoojit Sircar is returning to comedy after a few years, and this time with a new sub-genre. The filmmaker is attempting to explore a fresh facet of humor in cinema, one that is rarely explored in Indian films. The film will begin shooting in 2026 and will be one of the most unconventional projects made in Indian cinema.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The source further reveals that Sircar will explore and reinvent a key chapter of the Mahabharata with a comedic approach, giving a new spin to the epic tale. As this one-of-a-kind mythological comedy drama takes shape, the director will be casting Manoj Bajpayee and Rajkummar Rao in the lead roles.</p>

<p>The film is touted to be witty and to make the best use of eccentric comedy, balancing modern elements with a rooted narrative while staying true to the mythological epic.</p>

<p><strong>Shoojit Sircar&rsquo;s previous film</strong></p>

<p>Director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/vicky-donor-director-shoojit-sircar-reveals-an-a-lister-laughed-off-ayushmann-khurrana-starrers-script-shares-om-puris-reaction-bollywood-main-tum-yeh-karoge-1356749">Shoojit Sircar</a> last helmed the Abhishek Bachchan-starrer I Want to Talk. The drama film is based on the true story of Arjun Sen, a cancer survivor facing life-altering surgery while navigating a complex relationship with his daughter since her childhood.</p>

<p>Apart from Bachchan, the movie featured Ahilya Bamroo, Johny Lever, Pearl Dey, Jayant Kripalani, Kristin Goddard, and many more in key roles.</p>

<p><strong>Manoj Bajpayee and Rajkummar Rao&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Manoj Bajpayee was recently seen reprising his role as Srikant Tiwari in the web series <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/the-family-man-season-3-review-manoj-bajpayee-starrer-is-brilliant-take-on-spy-actioners-packed-with-impressive-thrills-1398609">The Family Man Season 3</a>, directed by Raj and&nbsp;DK.

According to our sources, the initial conversations have begun, and the project is shaping up to be a potential big one for both. &ldquo;Tiger is in talks and has really liked the subject. If all goes well, the film will go on floors in the first quarter of 2026. It&rsquo;s an action drama, and Milap is developing it at the moment,&rdquo; a source close to the development revealed to Pinkvilla.</p>

<p>For Tiger, this could mark a strong comeback of sorts. The actor was last seen in Baaghi 4, and before Ganapath, where he reunited with Kriti Sanon, followed by the multi-starrer Bade Miyan Chote Miyan with Akshay Kumar. Although some of his recent releases didn&rsquo;t perform as expected at the box office, Tiger remains one of the loved action actors, and fans have been waiting to see him in a role that plays to his strengths.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Nishabd was released in 2007. The movie drew inspiration from the Hollywood movie American Beauty and the Indian film Anokha Rishta. Besides Amitabh Bachchan and Jiah Khan, the movie also had <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mastiii-4-box-office-opening-weekend-vivek-oberoi-riteish-deshmukh-and-aftab-shivdasanis-adult-comedy-posts-poor-rs-7-crore-in-3-days-1398673">Aftab Shivdasani</a>, Revathi, Shraddha Arya, Rukhsar, and others in pivotal roles. The plot of Nishabd revolves around a 60-year-old family man photographer. Things changed upside down when the photographer fell for his daughter&#39;s 18-year-old friend while clicking her hot and bold pictures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though the movie received praise for its performances, but was panned for its controversial plot and subject. At the box office, it was a big flop.&nbsp;</p>

And they wildly argued and since they are in power, they made me cut out most of the scenes,&rdquo; added Ram Gopal Varma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Govinda Govinda had Nagarjuna and Sridevi in the lead roles, along with Paresh Rawal, Kota Srinivasa Rao, and Master Anil Raj. Arun Govil had played the role of Lord Vishnu in the film. The 1994 released heist film couldn&#39;t do much at the box office and turned out to be a failure. Later, the Nagarjuna starrer was dubbed in Hindi as well with the title, The Great Robbery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bankrolled by Vyjayanthi Movies, Govinda Govinda was the third film of Ram Gopal Varma with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/what-is-65-year-old-nagarjunas-secret-to-having-a-fit-physique-and-good-looks-74-year-old-rajinikanth-comments-1395148">Nagarjuna</a>, following their maiden collaboration, Siva (1989) and Antham Drohi (1992).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ram Gopal Varma&#39;s Rangeela (1995), starring Aamir Khan, Jackie Shroff, and Urmila Matondkar, is returning to the cinemas with 4K restored quality on November 28, 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vivek stated that he started as a co-founder, later turned advisor and investor in multiple companies. &ldquo;Shuruaat ki maine as a co-founder, phir dheere dheere jaise jaise time kam padta gaya, I became less of a co-founder and more of an advisor and investor.

Ab Company sunke logon ko yahi lagta hai, suit-tie polished, yahi lagta hai na. Hume kya pata tha konsi Company ban rahi hai. Wo jab samjha main, I said mujhe ek mauka de do. (I knew the picture was called Company. Now, this is what crazy people think of as a company, a polished suit-tie. How did we know what kind of company it was? When I understood that, I said, give me a chance.)&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, he added, &ldquo;I went and stayed in the slum. 6 hafte 7 hafte, main ek slum me jaake raha. Slum me bhaade pe kholi li, kholi me jaake raha. Raat ko bade bade chuhe aate the. Drum ke andar se paani nikalna padta tha. Bathroom tha nhi, aapko sulabh sauchalaya use karna padta tha, line me khada rehna padta tha.

<p>(I went and stayed in the slum. For 6 weeks, 7 weeks, I went to a slum. I rented a room in the slum and stayed there. Big rats would come in at night. I had to take out water from inside a drum. There was no bathroom, you had to use the toilet, stand in line.

<p>(Then when I went to Ramu ji, I went as the character because I didn&#39;t know whether he would let me audition or not. So I dressed up as the character. I entered his space with a whole bunch of photographs. He had made up his mind that this has to be done today.)</p>

<p>He went on to add, &ldquo;Toh main beedi phukta hua enter kiya jaise koi gangster enter karta hai aur kursi pe baith ke table ke upar pair rakha, chappal dono table ke upar. At the end of the day, he said, zabardast audition. I have never seen an audition like this. Finally, unhone bola, tum meri film kar rahe ho.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(So I entered smoking a cigarette, like a gangster, sitting on a chair with my feet on the table and my slippers on the table. At the end of the day, he said, &quot;What a tremendous audition. I have never seen an audition like this.&quot; Finally, he said, &quot;You&#39;re doing my film.&rdquo;)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vivek Oberoi then revealed to RGV that he is the son of Suresh Oberoi. Ramu was surprised and took him straight to his father&rsquo;s bungalow and told him that he was signing this film. RGV asked Suresh ji for a 10 rupee note,&nbsp;and he gave it to Vivek as a token amount. Seeing this, his father was in happy tears, full of pride.&nbsp;</p>

Yes, you read that right! After delivering the 2018 hit film and its equally impactful sequel, the makers are now gearing up for Raid 3, which is expected to roll by the end of 2026.</p>

<p>While the makers are keeping everything under wraps, the scale and emotions of Raid 3 will be higher than the previous films. The franchise, known for its intriguing storytelling and impactful sequences, is now set to take the narrative to a bigger and more complex terrain.</p>

<p>A source close to the development shares, &ldquo;The team has been quietly developing the script over the past few months. The conflict in the 3rd part is bigger than the earlier 2 films. The stakes are much higher, and the raid itself will be designed in a bigger way. Ajay Devgn&rsquo;s character will face a situation unlike anything seen in the franchise so far.&rdquo;</p>

Rajkumar Gupta is said to be closely working on the screenplay to ensure the film stays true to its realistic tone, like his past franchise.

The makers have locked a two-part release plan, with Dhurandhar Part 1 set to hit cinemas on December 5, 2025, while Dhurandhar Part 2 is slated for a Summer 2026 release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to sources close to the development, the decision to bring the film in two parts was a natural choice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ambitious story made on a massive scale, hence splitting it into two films made narrative sense. The world of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-wraps-up-shooting-for-dhurandhar-film-wrap-with-akshaye-khanna-on-october-12-1397538">Dhurandhar</a> is different, and where Part 1 ends, audiences will naturally be left wanting more,&rdquo; says the source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The edit for Part 1 is locked, and the runtime is close to 3 hours. Meanwhile, work is actively underway on Dhurandhar 2, which is currently in the pre-production phase.</p>

<p>The franchise approach is also seen as a strategic move in terms of budget and box office viability. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big-budget film with detailed production elements. Splitting it into two parts not only enhances storytelling but also makes it more financially feasible,&rdquo; the source adds.</p>

<p>The first look&nbsp;of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/is-ranveer-singhs-dhurandhar-movie-based-on-a-true-story-find-out-1397756">Ranveer Singh</a> to Akshaye Khanna has already taken social media by storm. Written, directed, and produced by Aditya Dhar, with the release dates locked, the anticipation begins. As the industry eagerly watches, all eyes are now on December 5 &mdash; the day Ranveer Singh ushers us into the world of Dhurandhar.</p>

<p>The film stars Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/dhurandhar-meet-r-madhavan-as-charioteer-of-karma-in-first-intense-look-from-ranveer-singh-starrer-1398323">R. Madhavan</a>, Arjun Rampal and Sara Arjun in key roles.</p>

Yes, you read that right!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaan will need to prep in action for over 60 days to perfect the kind of raw action that Ali wants him to do on screen. It is a pure coincidence that the date when he starts action training is his birthday! So, it&rsquo;s no days off for Ahaan as he will have a working birthday this year,&rdquo; informs a source close to the development.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaan will have to train in various action disciplines to look like a brute force of nature when he unleashes his action avatar in Ali&rsquo;s film. Ali is carefully working with Ahaan to unlock something that people can&rsquo;t even imagine. Ali will be the guide in Ahaan&rsquo;s prep journey, as the director wants to present his star in a jaw-dropping manner. The captain of the ship is known for presenting the biggest superstars in auras that people have loved, and he is excited to work with a young star like Ahaan now and do something insanely exciting. We have to wait for the film&rsquo;s asset to know what he has in mind,&rdquo; adds the source.</p>

<p>At just 27, Ahaan has delivered the all-time highest-grossing romantic film in the history of Indian cinema with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/saiyaara-box-office-collections-closes-at-568cr-worldwide-with-near-usd-20m-overseas-1396933">Saiyaara</a>. And interestingly, his debut was being compared to Hrithik Roshan&rsquo;s blockbuster launch in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, which happened 25 years ago. Well, now, the hype is for real for his second film, in which Ali will present him in an action-romance avatar.</p>

Currently busy in the shooting of his upcoming movie, Welcome To The Jungle, the director talked about how he is handling such a mega-ensemble star cast on the sets, while dropping insights on behind-the-scenes banter, real reason behind <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/i-did-cry-for-2-3-hours-sanjay-dutt-recalls-emotional-turmoil-after-lung-cancer-diagnosis-reveals-how-rakesh-roshan-helped-1396595">Sanjay Dutt</a>&#39;s exit, Baap release date and a lot more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>(Excerpts from the interview)&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Fans are waiting for Welcome To The Jungle. How much is still left to shoot?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>We are almost at the end. By January, it will be wrapped up. We are planning to release the film by next year in the mid.</p>

<p><strong>Akshay Kumar recently shared a glimpse with Disha Patani from the sets. Is Disha Patani paired opposite Akshay in the film, or was it just for the song sequence?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>No no, not only for songs, she is there in the film. Jacqueline is there, Lara, and Raveena are also there. You have to see the film to find out who&#39;s paired opposite Akshay.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What kind of comedy audience can expect from Welcome to the Jungle? Is it a situational comedy, slapstick, or brain rot?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a black dark situational humor. It&rsquo;s not a comedy. The producer always says we should not make comedy films. Firoz Nadiadwala believes in dark humor and situational humor. And of course, it&#39;s serious cinema: not a comedy or slapstick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, when you see <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-suniel-shetty-returns-as-yeda-anna-in-welcome-to-the-jungle-to-have-three-major-songs-1398416">Welcome to the Jungle</a>, if you mute it and see it, you&rsquo;ll think you are watching a serious film. You turn up the volume, and you&rsquo;ll realize you are watching some idiot&#39;s talk. There&rsquo;s a lot of action as well, and the scale is huge.</p>

<p><strong>Do you believe it&#39;s tough to make people laugh without offending someone in today&#39;s times?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comedy has always been offensive. Charlie Chaplin also used to do those kinds of comedy, which basically involved hits, falls, and slaps. Comedy is when a person laughs a lot. Otherwise, you need to be so talented and you need to have such good writing in dialogues that you can make someone laugh with dialogues. You laugh more when someone is poor or in trouble. You laugh more when you are in pain. So, comedy comes out of the pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How are you managing such a mega ensemble on the sets?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I know that&#39;s a stress. I think I can say without any apprehension that Welcome to the Jungle is the only film that has such a huge cast, and all are known actors. They are not unknown. So, I knew that we were heading towards some difficult challenges in terms of dates. The relationship of Firoz Nadiadwala and mine with everybody else is so good that they managed it for us. That&#39;s why it took us about a year and a half to do the film. But they all came up with dates.</p>

<p>Shooting is not an issue for me because I&#39;ve worked with everyone in my life. Basically, we are all friends on the set, and in between shots, there&#39;s so much banter happening, and so there&rsquo;s more comedy off camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your other film, Baap, is also in the pipeline. Can you share an update on that? When can it see the light of day?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s completed now, and Zee (Zee Studios) is going to plan the release. So, that is also like a big film. However, the director is new. But that&#39;s also completed, and Zee is going to announce the release date soon.</p>

<p><strong>You have worked with Sunny Deol in your debut film, and now you are shooting with Akshay Kumar. Have you ever thought of bringing Sunny Deol and Akshay Kumar together in a film?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I would love to, and both are very close to me.&nbsp; I&#39;ve worked extensively with both of them. I would like to collaborate on a film with Akshay Kumar, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rajkumar-santoshi-in-talks-to-direct-sunny-deol-in-jaat-2-1398042">Sunny Deol</a>, Sunil Shetty, and Sanjay Dutt, and put all of them together in a good action, toughy, testosterone-driven film.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Since you mentioned Sanjay Dutt. There were rumours that&nbsp;he walked out of Welcome To The Jungle over some creative differences.</strong> <strong>What&nbsp;happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>No, no. That was long ago because the dates did not match na. Otherwise, he was always a part of the film. Dates didn&#39;t match, and then he had to go to America for some treatment.</p>

<p><strong>There is also ongoing chatter that you are directing Awara Paagal Deewana 2. Is it true?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s on the pipeline. But I just want to finish this one first. Because this is the Titanic, which I am taking. So, Awara Pagal will be next immediately after I get on the post.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates.</p>

Veteran filmmaker Priyadarshan will direct the sequel, which will be backed by producers Ramesh Taurani and Akshai Puri. Just like the 2021 film, which was headlined by Saif Ali Khan, Arjun Kapoor, Jacqueline Fernandez and Yami Gautam, the sequel will also feature some established names, but the cast will be completely different from the original one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A source close to the development reveals that the team has been quietly working on the film for the last few months. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/priyadarshan-exclusive-interview-my-100th-film-is-definitely-going-to-be-with-mohanlal-1397071">Priyadarshan</a> sir will direct the film, and the team is currently shaping the script.

With Priyadarshan at the helm, a genius in the genre, and known for iconic comedies like Hera Pheri, Hulchul, and Bhool Bhulaiyaa, the audience can expect a stronger and more immersive horror-comedy tone.</p>

The actor shares a great camaraderie with Akshay Kumar, with whom he has worked in multiple films. He is reuniting with Khiladi Kumar yet again, in Firoz Nadiadwala's Welcome To The Jungle. Currently in production, the upcoming entertainer has a surprise for fans: Suniel Shetty's character. Pinkvilla has exclusively learned that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-suniel-shetty-reveals-marrying-mana-shetty-against-everyones-will-bahot-logon-ne-discourage-1394591">Suniel Shetty</a> will reprise his popular character ‘Yeda Anna’ from Awara Paagal Deewana, but with a twist. </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, director Ahmad Khan confirmed the development and spilled major details about Anna's character. He revealed, “Well, Suniel is playing the character that we have picked up from Awara Paagal Deewana, Yeda Anna. So, he is playing Yeda Anna with a little different touch. He has got that already up his sleeve, the same character.” </p>

<p>He further added, “You will basically see Anna, the same Suniel Shetty who was known for the character that he used to play: a funny, humorous Yeda Anna and Shyam.” </p>

<p>Ahmad went on to reveal that his character has a great banter with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-akshay-kumar-and-anees-bazmee-team-up-for-family-comedy-film-on-floors-in-feb-2026-1398048">Akshay Kumar</a> and Arshad Warsi, which will take the fun and chaos a notch higher. “He and Akshay go many years, and their banter together with the timing being just right. So, in this, I have him (Suniel Shetty), Akshay Kumar, and Arshad Warsi together. So, it multiplies (fun) three times. He is having a ball, and so are we.” </p>

<p>The Baaghi 2 director highlighted Anna's initial reaction upon learning the details of his character. Ahmad said, “He has always been a part of the Nadiadwala team with Feroz Nadiadwala. He is always in all Nadiadwala films. So, irrespective, he knew that he was going to be there. But when we told him the character, he completely jumped up. He said, I am not doing comedy films. But if this is the film and this is the role, I am hands-on completely.” </p>

<p>Khan concluded by mentioning that Suniel Shetty will have three grand songs in the film. “He's got three songs. I made him dance in his younger days. Now, again, I'm making him dance, and that's the best part about the man. He refuses to get old.” </p>

<p>Produced by Firoz Nadiadwala under Base Industries Group, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-akshay-kumar-to-begin-15-day-schedule-of-welcome-to-the-jungle-in-november-film-to-release-in-mid-2026-1397944">Welcome To The Jungle</a> stars a mega ensemble cast that includes Akshay Kumar, Suniel Shetty, Arshad Warsi, Paresh Rawal, Disha Patani, Jacqueline Fernandez, Raveena Tandon, Lara Dutta, and many others. The makers are aiming to wrap it up somewhere in January 2026, with an eye on a mid-2026 release.</p>

Inspired by the Shah Bano vs Ahmad Khan case, HAQ is helmed by Suparn Varma, who previously proved his mettle with Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai, The Family Man Season 2, Rana Naidu, and others. In an exclusive interview with Pinkvilla, Suparn Varma shared insights on Yami Gautam and Emraan Hashmi&#39;s nuanced performances, while expressing his excitement for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/the-family-man-3-trailer-out-manoj-bajpayees-srikant-tiwari-faces-off-against-new-threat-jaideep-ahlawat-1398287">The Family Man Season 3</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Excerpts from the interview:</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>The Shah Bano case is such a vast subject that could easily be adapted into a web series. It must be very difficult for you and your team to compile all of it in a 2-hour 16-minute film. So, how did you decide what to keep in the movie and what to avoid?</strong></p>

<p>We went with the heart of Shazia Bano (a character inspired by Shah Bano). For me, it was a story of a marriage that went wrong. A domestic dispute that escalated into a national controversy. And when I took that route, for me, it became a very, very personal story. For me, Shazia and Abbas (a character inspired by Ahmad Khan) were the two singular characters around whom the whole world would revolve and come around. One is fighting for her right to dignity. The other was fighting for what he thought was his right to faith, but misinterpreted it for his own use. So, they came from completely different spectrums, and she was trying to fight a system that was normalized at that period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the more we delved in depth, we realized that nothing really has changed for women over these centuries or decades either. Women still live in a man&#39;s world. It&#39;s the same gender bias. It&#39;s the same glass ceiling. It&#39;s the same struggles, the same issues. And maybe there is more awareness in a percentage-wise, but that is it.</p>

<p><strong>How did you keep a&nbsp;balanced approach towards Bano and Khan&#39;s characters?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The fact is that I don&#39;t see the world in black and white. I see the world in grays. Everybody acts a certain way, given the timing. You could do the right thing at the wrong time, the wrong thing at the right time. You could be a hero in one moment and a villain in the next. And it is, when you get into the story, that you see it for what it is. For example, you can see a man saving a dog&#39;s life and then going and k*lling somebody. Now, if I just change the sequence of events, he can be a hero or a villain.</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s a matter of perspective. So, my job as a filmmaker is to have a conversation with my audience. And that is what I&#39;ve been doing with Bandaa and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/haq-box-office-emraan-hashmi-and-yami-gautam-starrer-manages-fair-hold-on-first-monday-crosses-rs-10-crore-mark-1398354">HAQ</a>: talking about people interpreting things for you. It doesn&#39;t allow you room to think or to judge for yourself. Similarly, if a filmmaker is deciding good and bad for you, then what is the conversation he&#39;s having with you as an audience? He&#39;s telling you stuff. He&#39;s selling you stuff. This is a different genre. Here, you need to understand all sides so that you can make the best judgment for yourself rather than painting people into binaries of black and white, which doesn&#39;t work. The only way to have a conversation is to give you a point of view of two people. So that way, there are three versions of truth.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Be it Yami or Emraan, both actors did a great job. One can imagine Yami in such a hard-hitting role, but for Emraan, the audience has a different perception. How did you decide that he would fit into this character?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>First of all, Yami has never played a character like this before. I mean, nothing this intense, something that needed to plumb the depths of emotional intensity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-emraan-hashmi-says-the-bads-of-bollywood-would-have-earned-rs-600-700-crore-in-cinemas-1398238">Emraan</a>, it was also breaking his image and forcing him to rediscover himself as the intensely dramatic actor that he is. And I have seen the intensity in Emraan&#39;s work all through the years. He plays things with panache and charm. I wanted to use that charm and that intensity of his in a way where he is justified in whatever he&#39;s doing in his head.</p>

<p><strong>HAQ is receiving praise from the audience. However, there are some voices that are opposing the film and asking to even ban it. What would you like to say on that?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So far, the only voices that have spoken about the film or against it have been those in favor of it, with no mention of a ban or anything similar. They are of the view that there&#39;s a different kind of agenda. And my thing is, I speak from the truth. What agenda Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai had? None. HAQ has no agenda either. I come from a place of honesty and truth and from a place of emotional balance and a lot of research. And for those who are having issues with it, please see the film. The questions will be answered.</p>

<p><strong>I heard that you shot this film in Lucknow and nearby locations like Hardoi and Sitapur. How was your experience shooting there?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>We shot the entire film in 32 days, primarily in and around Lucknow. I shot in Sandila, Kakori, and Unnao, and spent two days shooting in Lucknow. We were shooting 3-3 hours every day of travel. Literally, we used to go in the morning and return at night. But for me, I needed to shoot the whole film there because of the authenticity. So, it was such that no set in the world could give me that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My production designers, Abhijit and Sonam, literally converted havelis that were falling apart and created a whole world for me out there in and around Lucknow in the most beautiful fashion. They gave it a sense of realism and authenticity that it doesn&#39;t really need, and it brought it to life, visually.</p>

<p><strong>You also directed Family Man Season 2 along with Raj &amp; DK. And now the third season is dropping soon. Were you involved in the third season as well, in any capacity?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>No, in the third season, I was not involved at all. I was shooting <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rana-naidu-s2-is-rana-daggubatis-show-an-indian-adaptation-of-this-iconic-american-crime-drama-1391159">Rana Naidu 2</a>, and then HAQ while they were making The Family Man Season 3. But I&#39;ve seen the trailer, and I really enjoyed it. I can&#39;t wait for the Tiwari family to be in more trouble. And then for Srikant and JK to build them out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>You have been active in the industry for so long. Before becoming a director, you were serving as the screenwriter. What is closer to you, writing or direction?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Both are close to me. Both are forms of creation. Writing is more painful than directing because writing involves staring at a piece of blank paper and then bleeding blood on it. But both are fun. Both are fun in their own respect. So I enjoy it. As long as I get to create, I&#39;m happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>You are also a producer, so what is more important to you: box office success or critical appreciation?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Box office, always. Critical appreciation is a bonus. At the end of the day, this is the business of filmmaking, and you should think of yourself as a stakeholder in this business, where you need to generate returns for your producers, studios, exhibitors, and distributors.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything you have planned for your next?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Agle chaar-paanch hafte jab tak HAQ theaters me chal rahi hai, main usko promote kar raha hoon. Uske baad aage ka sochunga. (I&#39;m promoting HAQ&nbsp;for the next four or five weeks while it&#39;s running in theaters. After that, I&#39;ll think about the future.)</p>

Shantaram. Yes, you read that right, and the biopic will be headlined by Siddhant Chaturvedi with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-taapsee-pannu-fardeen-khan-and-ammy-virk-team-up-for-mudassar-azizs-comedy-titled-zamana-kya-kahega-1395906">Fardeen Khan</a> playing an important role. The ambitious project, produced by Kiran Shantaram, will bring alive the timeless legacy of the legendary filmmaker on the big screen.</p>

<p>A source close to the development reveals, &ldquo;The team is quite kicked about this project and leaving no stone unturned to bring V. Shantaram&rsquo;s legacy alive on the big screen. Siddhant has already done a photoshoot for a look test, and the resemblance is striking. The film will go on floors in the next couple of months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Source further reveals, &ldquo;Shantaram was married thrice, and hence, 3 actresses will come on board to play his wives in the film.&rdquo; Filmmaker&rsquo;s first wife was Vimla, then he married to an actress Jayashree, with whom he had two children, and later, he married to Sandhya. Fondly called Annasaheb, Shantaram passed away on October 30, 1990, in Mumbai, and survived by his three wives and seven children.</p>

Shantaram &mdash; the man behind classics like Do Aankhen Barah Haath, Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje, and Navrang. While Siddhant&rsquo;s transformation is expected to be one of his most challenging performances yet, the makers are keeping details of Fardeen Khan&rsquo;s character under wraps for now.</p>

<p>Currently in the final stages of prep, the project is set to create a buzz within the industry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story that deserves to be told with sincerity and scale,&rdquo; the source adds.</p>

While the makers of the film are totally kicked to shoot, Pinkvilla has exclusively learned that Eetha movie will feature Randeep Hooda in the lead role, opposite <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shraddha-kapoor-gears-up-to-start-laxman-utekars-next-in-november-begins-training-in-classical-dance-1396783">Shraddha Kapoor</a>.</p>

<p>A source close to the development revealed, &ldquo;The shoot commences end of this month in Mumbai. Randeep plays the romantic lead opposite Shraddha&hellip;the makers are extremely confident about the casting, as both Randeep and Shraddha bring depth and versatility that fit perfectly with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-it-felt-as-though-a-lion-is-coming-chhaava-director-laxman-utekar-describes-vicky-kaushal-in-chhatrapati-sambhaji-maharajs-avatar-1370889">Utekar</a>&rsquo;s vision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The film aims to celebrate the life and legacy of Vithabai Narayangaonkar, one of Maharashtra&rsquo;s most revered folk artists, whose contribution to Lavani and Tamasha remains unparalleled. Known for her commanding stage presence and soulful performances, Vithabai earned two President&rsquo;s Awards for her work in preserving and popularising Indian folk culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, the project marks a unique collaboration between <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/randeep-hooda-addresses-bollywoods-no-show-for-swatantrya-veer-savarkar-admits-not-supporting-others-either-1292043">Randeep Hooda</a> and Shraddha Kapoor, pairing two actors known for balancing commercial appeal with strong performances.</p>

<p>With its powerful narrative and stellar casting, the film promises to be an emotional tribute to Maharashtra&rsquo;s vibrant folk heritage and a fitting ode to one of its most celebrated icons, Vithabai Narayangaonkar.</p>

The young filmmaker is developing a full-fledged entertainer, which is expected to go on floors in 2026. While details and cast about the project are being closely guarded, sources confirm to Pinkvilla that Shah Rukh Khan will not feature in the lead role. Aryan aims to bring a fresh cinematic experience with his second directorial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aryan wants to deliver a theatrical success and prove himself as a filmmaker before taking on the challenge of directing his superstar father, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/shah-rukh-khan-celebrates-his-60th-birthday-with-fans-in-mumbai-shares-a-special-gratitude-note-1398162">Shah Rukh Khan</a>,&rdquo; reveals a source close to the development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His idea is to earn that opportunity through merit and let his work speak for itself. If all goes as planned, Aryan&rsquo;s third directorial will feature SRK in the lead. The father-son duo has already locked the core idea, but the collaboration is expected to take shape only in 2027. For now, Aryan is focused on completing the script of his second feature, which will soon enter the casting stage,&rdquo; adds the source.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now, this is the plan &mdash; <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/aryan-khan-reveals-taking-a-stand-on-the-bads-of-bollywood-set-amid-opposition-recalls-filming-with-srk-and-suhana-during-lockdown-1397632">Aryan Khan</a>&rsquo;s third directorial is set to feature Shah Rukh Khan in the lead. However, in the world of cinema, plans can always change. There&rsquo;s always the possibility that King Khan, eager to collaborate with his son, might fast-track their project, making it Aryan&rsquo;s second film instead. For the moment though, Aryan remains focused on his upcoming entertainer. That said, an SRK-Aryan directorial pairing would undoubtedly be a cinematic moment fans across the world are eagerly waiting for.</p>

<p>Shah Rukh Khan starring in son&rsquo;s directorial would be a landmark moment. The father-son collaboration will carry insane emotional value, promising not just box office fireworks but also a creative synergy fans have long dreamed of witnessing on screen. And to remind, just a few minutes role of Shah Rukh Khan in The Ba***ds of Bollywood took the Internet by storm.</p>

He also revealed that he missed an opportunity to share screen with him, and would definitely like to work with King Khan in the near future. &ldquo;I worked with him as a producer, with Mr SRK. There was an opportunity to work on a film together, which didn&#39;t happen. But, hopefully, in the future, if I get to work with him on the film, I definitely will,&rdquo; added Hashmi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked which film it was, Hashmi quipped, &ldquo;I can&#39;t tell you that,&rdquo; and laughed.&nbsp;</p>

The film is expected to go on floors in February 2026, and as insiders describe, it is an intense yet soulful love story rooted in strong emotions and grand visuals.</p>

<p>A source close to the development reveals, &quot;Shashank Khaitan has been quietly developing this project for a while now, and the team is extremely excited about launching Subhan with this film&hellip; it is an intense romantic drama and the story unfolds in North India, where a major portion will be shot amidst the beautiful mountains of Manali.&quot;</p>

<p>The source further adds that music will play a crucial role in shaping the emotional backdrop of Aisi Deewangi. &quot;Shashank is personally working on the music album. He wants it to be a wholesome, heartfelt soundtrack that connects deeply with the audience, something that sounds fresh.&quot;</p>

<p>With Shashank&rsquo;s knack for bringing heartfelt romances and Subhan&rsquo;s debut, Aisi Deewangi is one of the most exciting projects to look forward to. The upcoming love story will be produced by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-after-varun-dhawan-janhvi-kapoor-shashank-khaitan-to-direct-kunal-kemmu-in-single-pappa-for-netflix-1368775">Shashank</a> under his banner Mentor Disciple Entertainment.</p>

He said, &ldquo;To be honest, when they said, there is a new director and it&#39;s Arjun Kapoor who had one movie and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/alpha-new-release-date-not-christmas-2025-but-alia-bhatt-and-sharvari-starrer-to-hit-screens-on-april-17-2026-1398173">Alia Bhatt</a> who had one movie, Student Of The Year. I was like &lsquo;okay&rsquo;, but this is not what was discussed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bhagat went on to add, &ldquo;It was such a nice casting, and it made the movie fresh because they were young. If it were older actors, I don&#39;t know, maybe they would have done a great job. But it was very surprising.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, Chetan Bhagat also mentioned that every actor had said no to Kai Po Che! Later, Sushant Singh Rajput, Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh played the lead roles and made the film immortal. He called Kai Po Che his book&#39;s best adaptation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The writer highlighted the incident in which Shah Rukh Khan showed his humility and kind gesture towards him, which impressed him the most. He said that he visited Om Shanti Om sets with his mother, and Shah Rukh himself pulled a chair for him. In another instance, when Cheten, along with Mohit Suri, visited SRK&#39;s residence, the King actor accompanied them to their car to say bye&nbsp;to them, making them feel very special and close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked whether Shah Rukh Khan has been an inspiration to him over the years, Ayushmann quickly replied, &quot;Absolutely.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s superstardom and fanbase aren&#39;t just limited to Bollywood actors. Even Hollywood stars are equally starstruck by his persona and talent. From John Cena, Will Smith, to Hugh Jackman, the list is too long.</p>

<p>According to our sources, the script has high-octane action, crime drama, and intense character arcs, and Ekta thinks <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-harshvardhan-ranes-ek-deewane-ki-deewaniyat-emerges-hit-nets-rs-6-crore-on-day-3-1397928">Harshvardhan Rane</a> fits the bill. However, they are still in talks. &quot;They&rsquo;re still figuring out on a lot of things about the film, but it&rsquo;s definitely a gangster saga with a contemporary edge. Audiences know Rane for intense love stories, and a film like this would position him in a completely different genre, giving him a fresh and edgy image,&quot; the source reveals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While everything is in its final stages, an insider suggests that Rane&rsquo;s character will be layered, exploring the ruthless side of a gangster with a mix of emotional drama, which aligns with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-tamannaah-bhatia-to-spearhead-ragini-mms-3-for-ekta-kapoor-1395955">Ekta Kapoor</a>&rsquo;s signature storytelling style. If the project takes off, it could mark a significant step in Rane&rsquo;s career, cementing his place among the new generation of actors willing to take bold choices. Now all eyes are on the official announcement!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We wonder if this will turn out to be Shootout 3 or Once Upon a Time in Mumbai 3, given its style and scale. Only time will tell!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ekta has Ragini MMS 3 with Tamannaah Bhatia, and is working on multiple other films, which includes a mytho-thriller helmed by Anil Rahi Barve.</p>

The film is produced by Namit Malhotra, and is easily the most awaited film of Indian Cinema, mounted on an unheard budget to provide an uncompromised cinematic experience to the audience. As the film is gearing up for a Diwali 2026 release, Pinkvilla has got an exclusive update on this epic tale celebrating triumph of good over evil.</p>

<p>A source shares, &ldquo;While the shooting for <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sunny-deol-on-ramayana-with-ranbir-kapoor-yash-we-are-aiming-for-perfection-1381210">Ramayana: Part One</a></strong> was wrapped up way back in June 2025, director Nitesh Tiwari has locked the edit for the first instalment.

The first round of VFX is also done, and the team has now taken the final edit for prolonged round of post-production.&rdquo; The source further informs that Namit Malhotra and his team are investing over 300 working days on just the VFX.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The intent is to lock the final cut of Ramayana: Part One by Summer 2026, for a Diwali release.

<p>Around 75 percent of the post-production work on Ramayana: Part Two will be completed before the release of Ramayana: Part One. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sign of confidence from Namit Malhotra on the world of Ramayana. He is leaving no-stone unturned to deliver an unforgettable theatrical experience,&rdquo; the source concludes.</p>

<h2 id="68dcefbc8e821"><strong>Farah Khan reveals her 8-hour comment wasn&rsquo;t a dig at Deepika Padukone</strong></h2>

<p>Talking to Pinkvilla, she said, &ldquo;To begin with, we were not following each other earlier, too!! We had made a pact during the Happy New Year shoot that we wouldn&rsquo;t communicate on Instagram; instead, direct message and call. We don&rsquo;t even wish birthday wishes on Insta because Deepika doesn&rsquo;t like it. Also, my 8-hour comment wasn&rsquo;t a dig; it was to make Dilip say that he will now also work 8 hours when he actually works just for 2 hours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Farah further added, &ldquo;No one even knows I was one of the first few people who went to see Deepika when <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/pic-deepika-padukone-bakes-chocolate-cake-for-daughter-duas-first-birthday-calls-it-love-language-1396661">Dua</a> was born, not everything is done for Instagram and paps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She concluded by saying, &ldquo;This new trend of making anything into a fake controversy has to stop!!

It can genuinely cause problems between people; thankfully, I pick up the phone and call them before it gets worse! But people need to stop doing this!&rdquo;</p>

He made his acting debut with the Mohit Suri-directed Saiyaara produced by YRF&rsquo;s CEO Akshaye Widhani, with Aditya Chopra as the presenter. The film scripted history at the box office by emerging the highest grossing love story of Indian Cinema and established the leads &ndash; Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda &ndash; as bankable Gen Z talents that the industry much needed.</p>

<p>Ever since the release of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/saiyaara-review-mohit-suri-gifts-ahaan-panday-and-aneet-padda-a-dream-debut-in-his-intense-love-story-1394012">Saiyaara</a></strong>, there has been constant demand from cine-goers, fans and the film fraternity to know the next move of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ahaan-panday-roped-in-by-6-top-gen-z-brands-saiyaara-star-in-demand-across-film-producers-too-1397151">Ahaan Panday.</a></strong> And now, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that Ahaan has signed his second project for the big screen with Aditya Chopra, and it will be directed by the man behind blockbusters like Sultan and Tiger Zinda Hai &ndash; Ali Abbas Zafar.</p>

<p>A source shares, &ldquo;Ali Abbas Zafar has been developing an action romance with Aditya Chopra as his next directorial. Ali has won over the audience with brilliant dramas like Sultan, and even in an action film like Tiger Zinda Hai, he made the storytelling gripping due to the drama that he infused in the scenes. Ali wanted to go back to his roots, to the genre that has given him so much love with his next film. He was blown away seeing Ahaan Panday and his aura with emotional and dramatic scenes in Saiyaara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The source adds, &ldquo;It was Aditya Chopra who suggested to Ali that he should go with Ahaan as a film with a young star would add to the surprise factor for audience. Aditya Chopra feels Ahaan&rsquo;s underexposure is his biggest strength because after Saiyaara&rsquo;s success, people will now be all the more excited to see what he does next. Adi and Ali will unlock a totally different side to Ahaan&rsquo;s acting in this yet untitled film by putting him into a new world where intense passion, romance and action meets hard-hitting drama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The source further informs, &ldquo;The script is locked and the music-seatings have already begun. Ali Abbas Zafar and Aditya Chopra are planning to take the film on floors around the first quarter of 2026.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The yet untitled film will be the fifth collaboration of Aditya Chopra and Ali Abbas Zafar after Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, Gunday, Sultan, and Tiger Zinda Hai. The duo commands a 100 percent HIT record, and the Ahaan Panday film is expected to continue their momentum.</p>

<p>Ahaan&rsquo;s collaboration with Ali Abbas Zafar will certainly be awaited, as the filmmaker is known to present his heroes like stars on the screen. The action workshops and look tests will commence shortly, as the makers are looking to present Ahaan in a brand new exciting look after Saiyaara.</p>

<p>19 years later, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ajay-devgn-to-start-drishyam-3-on-2nd-october-2025-confirmed-for-gandhi-jayanti-2026-release-1391946">Kumar Mangat and Abhishek Pathak</a></strong> are planning a spin off to the character of Langda Tyagi from Omkara. A source shares, &ldquo;The character of Langda Tyagi by <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/saif-ali-khan-forced-to-kiss-producer-for-rs-1000-actor-reveals-early-struggle-days-done-second-lead-third-lead-1397243">Saif Ali Khan</a></strong> has stood the test of times, as it continues to find a mention in the pop-culture every few months. 19 years later, based on the love given to the part from the audience, producers Kumar Mangat and Abhishek Pathak are all set for a spin-off to Langda Tyagi. The duo came across an idea that organically leads itself to the world of Omkara, and more so, Langda Tyagi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The source further informs that the writing work for Langda Tyagi is going on in full swing, and the makers are looking to take it on floors in 2026. As for the casting, all the details have been kept under wraps. But will Saif Ali Khan return? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret, which will unravel once the script is locked. Saif Ali Khan might just make a return to the world of Omkara, or the makers could rope in a young actor to play the part, making it a reboot in true sense,&rdquo; the source concludes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kumar Mangat and Abhishek Pathak have multiple other films in the development ranging from Drishyam 3, and Shaitaan to Housewife among others. Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates!</p>

And now, Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that John Abraham and Bhav Dhulia have locked the female lead of Force 3.</p>

<p>According to sources close to the development, Meenaakshi Chaudhary, known for films like GOAT, Guntur Kaaram, HIT 2, Lucky Baskhar, and Sankranthi Vasthunam, is all set to make her full-fledged Hindi debut with <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-john-abraham-reboots-force-teams-up-with-bhav-dhulia-for-force-3-1396355">Force 3</a></strong>. &ldquo;After auditioning multiple names, John Abraham and Bhav Dhulia have locked Meenaakshi Chaudhary as the female lead of Force 3.

Bollywood buffs have been going gaga over his performance, and he has become an overnight star who has the all-time biggest romantic film under his name now. There has been no looking back for the actor since then, and he has been flooded with film and brand offers from every corner. Undoubtedly, this budding star has become everyone&rsquo;s first choice, and we bet fans have no complaints at all.</p>

<h2 id="68d3d8c9371d8"><strong>Ahaan Panday has been signed by 6 top brands of the country</strong></h2>

<p>Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that Ahaan Panday has already become the next big thing. He has around 6 top Gen Z brands ready to sign him. As you already know, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/ahaan-panday-and-aneet-padda-finally-break-silence-on-saiyaaras-success-with-emotional-letters-its-sitting-heavy-in-my-chest-1395244">Saiyaara</a>&rsquo;s production banner, YRF, had kept the actor under wraps as they believed in his brilliant acting skills. There were no interviews, no public appearances and when Mohit Suri directorial released, Panday mesmerised everyone.</p>

<p>It is said that his appearances are kept under check even now, after the release, as YRF believes overexposure is the death of stardom. Despite all the secrecy, Ahaan has managed to grab the attention of top-notch makers from the film and advertising world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every brand today wants to speak to the Gen Z, and Ahaan Panday is the biggest male star of that generation, while his Saiyaara co-star Aneet Padda is the biggest female star! It is a no-brainer that Ahaan Panday is the most sought-after young star of the country today because this generation is the hardest to please, and Ahaan has done that with his talent. He has been signed by 6 top brands of the country as per the industry, and YRF is planning a massive rollout campaign of his brands from October onwards!&rdquo; informs a source.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This kid is the top name in every boardroom today. You can imagine market leaders of every segment today will definitely discuss Ahaan as a front-runner brand endorser if campaigns need to be aimed at Gen Z! From the line up of brands that we are hearing, we can confidently say that Ahaan is being scooped up by all major players who wants to bet big on this new sensation and punt their money on him to have a great career ahead,&rdquo; says the source.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rollout of brands will shock and awe people in the industry. Expect a blitzkrieg of brand announcements that has never happened before for a debutant in a long, long time. The hype that Saiyaara is a modern-day DDLJ will be proven once again once Ahaan&rsquo;s brand line-up is announced,&rdquo; adds the source.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see which is the next film of Ahaan Panday, and in the coming few months, we can expect to hear a lot of brand announcements.</p>

The film reboots the Don franchise, as Farhan hopes to paint the genre with fresh colours. As reported by Pinkvilla before, the makers have roped in Kriti Sanon to play the female lead of Don alongside Ranveer.

<p>When asked if he had ever said no to a producer, Bobby Deol recalled a story from his father, Dharmendra&rsquo;s, times. He revealed that all these things happened with his father. There is a big director who has made quite blockbuster films, and the Sholay star was working with him quite often in those days. So he had approached the star for a big film then, which everyone has seen and is also amongst our favorites, claimed Bobby.</p>

<p>So Dharmendra had to say no to the director for some reason, and he did that very politely. But this did not go down well with the director, and he never worked with the actor again. The Ba***ds of Bollywood actor also stated that nothing like this has ever happened with him. He started working with the thought that he would not do many films.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maine humesha kam filmein ki hai aur problem ye hoti thi ki kitne producers hai jinhone paise diye nahi. Wo promise karte the, phir release ke pehle dubbing kar lo bolte the lekin dubbing ke baad kabhi diye nahi. Lekin abhi badal gaya. Abhhi pure contracts sign hote hai, pure deals banti hai aur kaafi darawne contracts bante hai jise padh ke aap zyada dar jate ho,&rdquo; he said. (I have always worked in less number of films, and the problem with me used to be that many producers did not pay despite promising me. But now it&#39;s different. Now, proper contracts are signed, and they are so scary that you yourself will be scared after reading them.</p>

<p>Bobby Deol concluded by saying that other than all this, whichever producer he has worked with in his career, everyone has worked with a lot of love and have given the actor a lot of respect.</p>

He is planning a multi-film slate, which is presently in different stages of development. &ldquo;Right now, the film I am making is going to consume sometime, and my focus is on direction. But Mamta, my partner in Marflix is actively working on some stuff. &nbsp;She will be the right person to give details on our projects when the time is right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over the 20-year period, Siddharth has created films like Bang Bang, War, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shah-rukh-khan-and-aditya-chopra-to-reunite-on-pathaan-2-set-to-begin-end-of-year-1280033">Pathaan</a></strong>, and Fighter, which have the scope for a second part.

I try to do things that are not in my comfort zone. I don&rsquo;t want to be in a zone thinking about love for the franchise, and take things for granted. I want to challenge myself and do things that are new. Of course, I want to keep creating new franchises, which I don&rsquo;t know when I will get back to them. The aim is to create characters that are loved by the audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lastly, is there a genre that Sid wishes to make? &ldquo;There is a genre I want to work on, and it&rsquo;s something I have been working on (silently).

The team recently headed to the region to shoot key portions of the film, which is inspired by true events. The Leh schedule is expected to last for about 15&nbsp;days and will capture the natural beauty and rugged landscapes of Ladakh.</p>

<p><strong>Shooting schedule in Leh</strong></p>

<p>According to sources, this schedule is an important phase of filming. Crucial scenes involving <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/meet-actor-chitrangda-singh-who-almost-left-industry-walked-away-from-nawazuddin-siddiqui-film-for-saying-no-to-explicit-scenes-and-is-now-set-to-star-with-salman-khan-1391928">Chitrangda Singh</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/did-salman-khan-push-anurag-kashyap-out-of-tere-naam-abhinav-kashyap-calls-him-a-goon-1396565">Salman Khan</a> will be shot here. The makers aim to use the unique landscape of Ladakh to give the story an authentic backdrop. With its striking terrain and raw setting, Leh adds to the visual scale of the film. The cast and crew have been seen arriving together, with Salman Khan leading the team for this highly anticipated schedule.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s why the Leh shoot is getting attention: the team is expected to wrap up key character portions in this schedule. Since the film is inspired by real incidents, the natural setting of Ladakh helps in keeping the narrative closer to reality. The filmmakers are focusing on authenticity, and Ladakh&rsquo;s stark landscapes make it an ideal location for the story.</p>

<p>A source close to the production shared that the schedule will cover some of the most crucial parts of the film. This is one of the final outdoor shoots before the project moves into its next phase.</p>

<p><strong>Chitrangda Singh&rsquo;s role in the film</strong></p>

<p>Chitrangda Singh has expressed excitement about being part of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/battle-of-galwan-teaser-poster-salman-khans-intense-army-look-jai-hind-bgm-takes-internet-by-storm-himesh-reshammiya-onboard-1392956">Battle of Galwan</a>. The actress is expected to bring emotional depth and strength to her character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battle of Galwan is inspired by real-life events along the India-China border. The film focuses on the courage and challenges faced by soldiers during the clashes in Galwan Valley. With Salman Khan leading the cast and supported by actors like Chitrangda Singh, the movie aims to present a gripping retelling of the incident.&nbsp;</p>

The romantic comedy is all set to hit the big screen on August 29, 2025 with a good interest in the cinema-going audience with the song &lsquo;Pardesiya&rsquo; gaining strong traction. The romantic comedy has been certified U/A by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with an approved runtime of 2 hours and 16 minutes.</p>

<p>Param Sundari is seeing an all India release by Pen Marudhar, and the distributor is looking to bring the film on about 2700 screens with 8000 plus shows in India. The advance bookings for Param Sundari opened partially on Tuesday morning, with full-fledged bookings kick-starting from the same evening.</p>

<p>As on Thursday at 3 PM, Param Sundari has sold around 20,000 tickets in the top 3 national chains &ndash; PVRInox and Cinepolis &ndash; and the film will be looking to double up from here by mid-night. The apt comparison for Param Sundari is another Maddock Film, Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya, which had sold around 17,000 tickets at 3 PM, and closed with final pre-sale of 33,000 tickets in the chains. The Sidharth Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor film could be around the 40,000 tickets mark in the chains, closing around 20 percent more than the Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon starrer.</p>

<p>Given the advance booking trends, the first day business of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/param-sundari-advance-booking-sidharth-malhotra-janhvi-kapoors-rom-com-sells-12000-tickets-in-national-chains-1396167">Param Sundari</a></strong> is expected to be in the range of Rs 8.00 crore to Rs 9.00 crore, which is a very good result for a film starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-the-opening-day-hindi-net-box-office-of-param-sundari-baaghi-4-the-bengal-files-and-more-in-india-1396121">Sidharth Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor</a>, that too in the romantic space. The first day of Param Sundari yet again puts the focus on how one hit song in the music album, true to the world of the film, can create an excitement in the target audience.</p>

<p>From a start around the Rs 8.50 crore mark, Param Sundari will be aiming to see a spike in business on Saturday and Sunday, taking the opening weekend biz in the north of Rs 30 crore. From Saturday jump and Monday hold will boil down to the audience report, as a positive word of mouth could give us another success in the romantic space much like other Maddock Films in the genre like Zara Hatke Zara Bachke and Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya.</p>

<p>Shamita Shetty added that she didn&rsquo;t open up about how she felt when she was a child. But today, when the actress is asked about how she feels about the comparisons, her only thought is that it&rsquo;s stupid to compare 2 human beings. &ldquo;Every personality is different; it&rsquo;s not just about two siblings. Two people in the same household can be exact opposites, and that is exactly Shilpa and me, and we have our own individual forte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Recently, the two sisters were seen in the Rakshabandhan special episode of The Great Indian Kapil Show. The warm bond that they share was evident in that episode. Even social media is proof of the love Shamita and Shilpa have for each other.</p>

Uske kaam ko leke, uske surrounding ko leke mein baat karta hu.&rdquo; (I will never speak ill of Govinda as an actor or a person. I only talk about his work and the people around him.)</p>

<p>He also noted how outside voices can sway the star. &ldquo;Uski soch na kabhi kabhi gadbad hojati hain kyuki logo ko sun sun ke&hellip;woh feeding hojati hain aur woh maan jaata hain.&rdquo; (His thinking sometimes gets disturbed by what people feed him, and he believes it.)</p>

<p><strong>Why Pahlaj won&rsquo;t advise Govinda</strong></p>

<p>When asked if Ssunita Ahuja now oversees Govinda&rsquo;s work, he said, &ldquo;Pata nai woh toh mujhe. Mein toh bhola bhaiya, woh toh kabhi alag hoge nai.&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t know about that. I&rsquo;ve always known them together; they were never separate.)</p>

<p>On divorce rumours, he added, &ldquo;Kisine bola woh divorce bhi file kiye&hellip;mein bola &lsquo;they are like buddies&rsquo;&hellip;as a family bolo, as a work partner socho&hellip;kabhi mein aisa dono ke beech mein dekha nai.&rdquo; (Someone said they&rsquo;ve even filed for divorce. I said, they are like buddies. Whether as a family or work partners, I have never seen anything like that between them.)</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what everyone&rsquo;s asking: Are Govinda and Sunita divorcing?</strong></p>

<p>Nihalani&rsquo;s take was firm: The buzz doesn&rsquo;t match what he has seen. He stressed friendship and partnership, not separation.</p>

<p>He also recalled learning about their love story late. &ldquo;Mujhe maalum hi nai tha. Shaadi bhi hogayi woh bhi nai maalum tha&hellip;86 ke baad hi kiya usne lekin mujhe nai maalum tha.&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t even know. I didn&rsquo;t know they had married. He married after 1986, but I wasn&rsquo;t aware.) He added that they only met on sets: &ldquo;Zaroori nai hain na ki share kare&hellip;Humlog set pe hi milte hain.&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s not necessary to share everything. We only met on set.)</p>

<p>When asked if it was rivalry or competition, Nihali elaborated on how there was competition. He disclosed what he did after Govinda and Chunky left his house.</p>

<p>Pahlaj recalled, &quot;Jaise hi gaye voh kuch 5 5:15 tha, mai sone laga toh ye inki baat dhyaan mei aa rahi thi. (As soon as they left at 5 or 5:15 AM, I was trying to sleep but their suggestion was in my mind).&quot;</p>

<p>He remembered getting an idea for a film at that time and said, &quot;I just got a thought in the sleep ki ek baap ke do nalayak bete aisa kuch kaam karte hai (While sleeping I got a thought of a father having to useless son, something on this should work).&quot;</p>

<p>When asked about his present relationship with Govinda, Nihlani said, &quot;Dosti kabhi rahi nahi voh meri respect karta tha (There was never friendship, he respects me).&quot;</p>

<p>When asked about the situation at the hospital after Divya Bharti&rsquo;s sudden fall in 1993, Nihalani said she was alone when she was brought in. &ldquo;Akeli bichari thi tab tak koi nai tha,&rdquo; (She was all alone, by that time no one was there), he revealed. He added that by the time he reached, no one from her family had arrived. &ldquo;Tab tak kisiko nai tha, jab tak aaya jab mujhe maalum padaa immediately I rushed to the hospital,&rdquo; he said. (Till then, no one had come. As soon as I found out, I immediately rushed to the hospital.)</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what Nihalani remembers about working with her</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/union-budget-2021-exclusive-pahlaj-nihalani-feels-gst-film-industry-should-be-waived-next-3-years-605188">Pahlaj Nihalani</a> also shared memories from the Shola Aur Shabnam sets.

Raat ke 3 baje the aur subah 6 baje gaane ke liye tayyar hui, maine bola shooting cancel kardi maine,&rdquo; (She kept working, a nail had pierced her foot. It was 3 a.m. at night, and by 6 a.m. she was ready for a song shoot. I told her the shooting was cancelled.) he shared.</p>

<p>The filmmaker shared a&nbsp;moment to show how dedicated Divya Bharti was when she&nbsp;surprised him and his wife. &ldquo;Mein soya tha ki subah cancel hain, fir bhi room mein aayi, mera housekeeping se darwaza khola aake beth gayi mere chest pe ki utho. Meri wife boli ye kaun hain. Matlab mein aur wife dono soye hain aake mere peth pe aake baith gayi.&rdquo; (I was asleep since the morning shoot was cancelled, but still she came into my room, got the door opened through housekeeping, and sat on my chest saying &lsquo;wake up&rsquo;. My wife asked, &quot;Who is this girl? Both my wife and I were sleeping, and she came and sat on my stomach.&quot;&nbsp;Nihalani said.</p>

<p>Even decades later, Divya Bharti continues to be remembered as one of the most talented young actresses of her time. Nihalani&rsquo;s memories shed light on her dedication, charm, and the tragic loneliness of her final moments.</p>

You have to put your child, family first.&#39; What is wrong or harm about putting yourself first?&quot;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/malaika-arora-on-being-raised-by-single-mother-and-taking-care-of-her-sister-i-became-responsible-before-my-time-exclusive-1395644">Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa</a> fame pointed out how it is said to love yourself first before loving someone else. She disclosed, &quot;At that point, I needed to be happy before trying to work anything else out or making anybody else happy; I was not happy.&quot;</p>

<p>She remembered how people had opinions and called her decision &quot;selfish.&quot; She took a jibe at them, saying, &quot;That may be selfish to you. I did what I felt. It is hard for people to understand how can you put yourself first. Yes, I did. That decision today has helped me to be a better person. I have become more at ease with myself, I&#39;m in a happier space. Not just that, my kid is in a much better and happier space. I don&#39;t think he would have wanted to be in a space where things are not conducive.&quot;</p>

<p>She stated that she and Arbaaz Khan moved separate ways, but maintained the core essence of their son and decorum with their families. She shared that she is now in a happier and better place. She revealed that she wasn&#39;t in a good space earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked if co-parenting is easy, she replied, &quot;It has its challenges for sure. It&#39;s very important to find its balance. I cannot sit down here and say, it&#39;s the easiest thing on planet earth. No, it is not. Every day through co-parenting, you have to navigate but after all these years, we have found a good balance.&quot;</p>

<p>Malaika Arora emphasized that when she started earning at the age of 17, she was focused only on earning, saving and investing. When asked if this was because she was raised by a single mother, Malaika agreed, saying, &quot;Probably. I think you grow up with certain insecurities.&quot;</p>

<p>Recalling her mother&#39;s struggles, the actress shared, &quot;Not that we lacked anything. My mom worked very hard and made sure she gave us everything under the sun. Whether it was education, food on the table, clothes to wear, or anything. She never ever said that you can&#39;t. However difficult it may have been but she never said you can&#39;t have this. She did it all on her own. She worked, brought us up, put us through school, college, everything.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa judge explained, &quot;I guess that sort of grit, determination, or strength I have got from her. I have learned and been imbibed from her. I think I have pretty much grown up as a child to a woman, seeing how she has led her life.&quot;</p>

<p>Malaika mentioned that because of the circumstances, she often felt the need to do more. She mentioned how she wanted to be a daughter whom everybody relied&nbsp;on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked if she ever had a difficult journey, the diva agreed that there were times when she felt like taking a backseat, but also realized that she has a responsibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She said, &quot;I can&#39;t put my feet up and say &#39;Are muje kaam nahi karna (I don&#39;t want to work). That liberty toh hai hi nahi (There&#39;s no liberty).&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malaika expressed that she does not have ancestral property and will have to work hard to achieve her goals. She shared her disappointment with people who comment on her lifestyle, noting that they fail to realize how much effort is required to maintain a certain way of living, manage a household, and ensure everything is taken care of. She emphasized that people often see only the glamorous aspects, overlooking the hardships involved.</p>

<p>When asked about the nature of their friendship, Malaika revealed, &quot;We have laughed, we have cried, fought, travelled. Food is a huge factor that binds us. The other thing is, I think we are all very similar. We come from very similar ways of upbringing. Similar backgrounds of growing up, parents. I think that is also what got us together. I think there is a lot of similarities. Two girls, sisters, sisterhood, that kind of bonding.&quot;</p>

<p>When questioned about their disagreements, Malaika clarified that they don&#39;t fight but may have differing opinions on certain topics. She mentioned that their differences are usually minor issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She elaborated, &quot;Somebody may not have said something, or somebody must have forgotten something, and then you bring it up. Those kind of things. Very very silly or trivial things.&quot;</p>

<p>Arora was asked if they support each other during tough times, to which she instantly agreed, saying, &quot;My family, we went through a tough time; her (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/photos-6-celebrity-spottings-of-the-day-randhir-kapoor-babita-visit-saif-ali-khan-kareena-kapoors-house-shraddha-kapoor-hits-the-gym-1369045">Kareena Kapoor</a>) family went through a tough time.

<p>Reflecting on childhood, Malaika said she naturally stepped into a bold, caring role. &ldquo;Like I said, I wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;dada,&rsquo; but I was very bold, and my sister was the opposite, very scared and very quiet (&quot;ekdum dari hui, ekdam chupchap baithti thi&quot;). I was always the one to protect her.&rdquo; She shared about her sister Amrita, &ldquo;If she needed something, she would come to me and always call me didi. All through her growing-up years, she called me didi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Malaika shared that caretaking became second nature. &ldquo;I was the one who would be with her, hang with her, and take care of her, so everyone felt I was like a surrogate mother to my sister. I was very tomboyish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She extended that instinct to friends in her building: &ldquo;And the kids in our building (&quot;aur building ke jo bache bhi the&quot;), I always wanted to stand up for them and look after them. If anyone bullied them or if a fight broke out (&quot;koi bhi unko bully kare yaa kuch toh jhagra ho jaye&quot;), I would step in. That&rsquo;s probably why I was known as a tough person.&rdquo;</p>
