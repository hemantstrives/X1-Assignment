Know all about the NFL star's salary and if he is richer than Taylor Swift]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/1243473946_image-1280x720-9-1.jpg"></img><p>Travis Kelce shines as the Kansas City Chiefs&rsquo; tight end. The athlete, who had locked in a brilliant performance in the previous season of the NFL, received praise from his fans, as well as his girlfriend, Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>Not only has Kelce proven to be a solid athlete, but he is also smart enough to make money even when he is off the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kelce is known to be the highest-paid player in the soccer team. Moreover, the athlete also manages to earn while being a podcaster alongside his brother. Over the years, Travis has built his way to immense wealth and properties in the States.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="684b2c100cc1c"><strong>What is Travis Kelce&rsquo;s net worth in 2025?</strong></h2>

<p>According to the media reports, Travis Kelce has a net worth of a whopping 90 million USD. The Kansas City Chiefs&#39; tight end has several streams through which he earns his money when not playing sports.</p>

<p>Apart from earning from his podcast, New Heights, the NFL star has also ventured into the Hollywood industry. Kelce hosted a couple of reality shows while also collaborating with a huge line of prestigious and luxurious brands, like State Farm, Pfizer, Bud Light, Nike, and others.</p>

<p>Additionally, there have been rumors about Taylor Swift&rsquo;s boyfriend being a part of an upcoming movie, alongside Adam Sandler.</p>

<p>On the sports front, Kelce has signed a two-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2024, for the amount of 34.2 million USD. As per the NFL website, that accounts for the athlete taking a salary of 17 million USD per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, there had been speculations over Travis&rsquo; contract coming to an end in 2025. However, there has been no confirmation about it yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the soccer star&rsquo;s expensive deal with his team comes after Kelce spoke about being underpaid in 2023.</p>

<p>While sitting down for an interview with Vogue, the sportsman stated, &quot;My managers and agents love to tell me how underpaid I am. You see how much more money you could be making and, yeah, it hits you in the gut a little bit. It makes you think you&#39;re being taken advantage of&hellip;But I enjoy coming to that building every single day.&quot;</p>

<p>While Kelce&rsquo;s net worth is something to swoon over, the Kansas City Chiefs star is not yet on the same platform as his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, who stands at a net worth of 1.6 billion USD.</p>

The duo, with 49 49-year age difference, met each other on a flight to Florida. Hudson, apparently, charmed the football coach with a textbook that she had been reading during her journey.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="684bdc42a2275"><strong>Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson&rsquo;s love story</strong></h2>

<p>As per the media reports, Belichick was amazed by Hudson in February 2021, on the plane to Florida. The social media influencer, who was reading a textbook with the title Deductive Logic at that time, caught the football coach&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Belichick struck up a conversation with Hudson and also went on to give his autograph in her book. Alongside, the sportsperson also wrote, &ldquo;Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As one thing led to another, the duo exchanged phone numbers, and the spark flew between the two. Keeping a low profile initially, the duo went public with their relationship in January 2023. The couple was spotted together taking a stroll in New Orleans&rsquo; French Quarter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Witnessing a strong bond between Jordon and Bill, the fans also speculated if the couple was engaged. However, none have opened up about their future plans in the public domain.&nbsp;</p>

Find out all about Rohit Sharma’s wife’s special relationship with Virat Kohli before his marriage to Anushka Sharma]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/1260546429_image-1280x720-7-1.jpg"></img><p>Virat Kohli, who married the actress-producer Anushka Sharma in 2018, had one of the most memorable weddings in the industry. However, it wasn&rsquo;t the only time the cricketer grabbed attention for being in a relationship privately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before getting&nbsp;married to the Band Baaja Baarat actress, Kohli was often spotted with Ritika Sajdeh, making the fans speculate if the duo had any kind of romance going on between them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the media reports revealed that Ritika Sajdeh, who is now married to the Indian cricket team&rsquo;s opening batsman, Rohit Sharma, served as Kohli&rsquo;s sports manager in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="684b13d045569"><strong>Who is Ritika Sajdeh?</strong></h2>

<p>While the audience speculated about a romantic relationship between Virat Kohli and Ritika Sajdeh, it was clear in the media reports that the latter acted as a sports talent manager for the athlete. The duo first connected in 2010, when Sajdeh stepped up to handle Virat&rsquo;s representation in the IPL.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The professional relationship between the two eventually turned into a close bond of friendship. Kohli and Sajdeh were often spotted enjoying each other&rsquo;s company. One of the reasons Ritika and Kohli connected on a personal level was because Virat was a good friend of Sajdeh&rsquo;s brother, Bunty Sajdeh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bunty has supported the sportsman in the early days of his career. The former would bring brand endorsements of the cricketer, helping him boost his net worth.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="684b13d045572"><strong>Virat Kohli and Ritika Sajdeh&rsquo;s alleged spottings</strong></h2>

<p>In 2013, following India&rsquo;s successful series against Zimbabwe, Virat was spotted outside a theater with a mystery girl. The media reports later revealed it to be none other than Kohli&rsquo;s sports manager, Ritika.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the snap of the duo, the fans went on to speculate if Sajdeh was the new girl in the cricketer&rsquo;s life, linking them together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the headlines and rumors, both the sportsman and Sajdeh maintained that they are good friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the episode, Ritika went on to marry Rohit Sharma, India&rsquo;s opening batsman, in 2015. The couple are parents to two kids, Samaira, who they welcomed in 2018, and Ahaan, who was born in November 2024.</p>

<p>Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma also embraced parenthood, as they welcomed their daughter Vamika in 2021 and son Akaay in 2024.</p>

Know All About NFL Star’s Children He Shares With Different Women]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/1980721385_lead.jpg"></img><p>Tyreek Hill, the wide receiver of the Miami Dolphins team, has been playing football for the past several years and has many accolades to his name. Professionally known as Cheetah, the athlete has often made headlines for his personal life. Reportedly, he is a father to 7 kids, whom he shares with different women. Hill allegedly had been in four relationships before tying the knot with his now-estranged wife, Keeta Vacarro, in November 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to several reports, the 31-year-old shares three kids, Zev and twins Nakeem and Nyla, with his former fianc&eacute;e, Crystal Espinal, with whom he was in a relationship until 2017. The football star is also a father to other kids he has from his previous relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Tyreek Hill&rsquo;s children and previous relationships</strong></p>

<p>Tyreek Hill welcomed his seventh kid, Capri, in 2024, with his now estranged wife, Vaccaro. Additionally, the athlete is also a father to three children: Zev, whom he welcomed in 2014, and twins Nakeem and Nyla, born in 2017, with his former partner, Crystal Espinal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NFL star was engaged to Crystal until 2017. As the latter gave birth to the twin girls following their split, she filed a paternity suit against Hill to hose down the speculation of cheating on the 31-year-old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the paternity suit, the football player proudly embraced his identity as a girl dad.&nbsp; Meanwhile, it was reported that Hill had fathered children with other women from his relationships, apart from Vaccaro and Espinal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tyreek Hill on fatherhood</strong></p>

<p>Previously, in a conversation with USA Today, the athlete discussed his dual roles as a father and a sportsman. In the 2020 interview, Hill mentioned, &ldquo;I just feel like I&rsquo;m truly blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further added, &ldquo;Each and every day I get up, I get a chance to play the game that I love, be around people who are loving, and then I get a chance to be around my kids and be in their lives. I feel like I&rsquo;m truly blessed.&quot;</p>

<p>The Miami Dolphins star also made an appearance on the It Needed to be Said podcast in 2023, where Hill reflected on the difficulties he was facing balancing kids and sports together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tyreek stated, &quot;Earlier in my career, bro, I&#39;d come home and my kids would be like, &#39;Dad, it&#39;s play time, let&#39;s play, let&#39;s play, let&#39;s run around.&rsquo; I&#39;m like, &#39;Bro, I&#39;m tired. Your dad is tired.&#39; Like I got to learn these plays and I gotta watch these films.&quot;</p>

<p>Though Tyreek Hill initially faced issues getting the right grip, he eventually got better at it as he grew older.</p>

Here's everything about the controversy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/1885533010_lead-image.jpg"></img><p>The French Open Women&rsquo;s Final in Paris witnessed a nail-biting play-off between Aryna Sabalenka from Belarus and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/snoop-dogg-wears-custom-t-shirts-featuring-olympians-simone-biles-and-coco-gauff-amid-paris-olympics-2024-appearance-1333702">Coco Gauff </a>from Atlanta. The latter beat the former with a remarkable score of 6-7 (5), 6-2, and 6-4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, things heated up pretty quickly after Aryna, during a post-match interview, made some controversial comments against Coco, which earned her ire and backlash from fans.</p>

<p><strong>Aryna Sabalenka clarifies controversial comment on Coco Gauff</strong></p>

<p>While Aryna&rsquo;s statement has raised questions about sportsmanship among fans, the Belarusian tennis star recently took to her Instagram stories to offer clarification on her statement.</p>

<p>She cited human errors at the core of her mistake and added how it was due to the bad moment she had after facing defeat. Nonetheless, she expressed that Coco Gauff earned the title and respect for the efforts she had put in.</p>

<p>The note on her social media read, &ldquo;You all know me... I&rsquo;m always going to be honest and human in how I process these moments. I made over 70 unforced errors, so I can&rsquo;t pretend it was a great day for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aryna then added, &ldquo;But both things can be true&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t play my best, and Coco stepped up and played with poise and purpose. She earned that title. Respect. Time to rest, learn, and come back stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>What was Aryna Sabalenka&rsquo;s comment against Coco Gauff?</strong></p>

<p>Coming back to the statement made by Aryna against Coco, she became overly emotional at the time of defeat and expressed that the latter won the match not because she played well. But because the former had made some mistakes during her gameplay.</p>

<p>Moreover, Aryna Sabalenka also claimed that if she were to be defeated in the semi-finals by Polish tennis player Iga Swiatek, then she would have proceeded to the finals and defeated Coco to win the final.</p>

<p><strong>Coco Gauff reacted to Sabalenka&rsquo;s comment about Iga Swiatek defeating her in finals</strong></p>

<p>After Aryna Sabalenka made the distasteful comment on Coco Gauff tagging Iga Swiatek, the Atlanta-based tennis player reacted to the comparisons drawn.</p>

<p>She confidently responded to the claim that Swiatek would have defeated her in the finals by saying, &ldquo;I mean, I don&#39;t agree with that. I&#39;m sitting here.&quot;</p>
