While many thought that it was a running jacket with the ability to store a water bottle and other such basics, a few debated whether it was a weighted one instead, which is usually seen during military training.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These days, V has been running with Jungkook whenever possible, and the two even declared rules for fans if they ever spot the two along the Han River course. This includes not talking to them, laughing at them, overtaking them, or taking any photographs of their faces. After weeks of successful, undisturbed workout sessions, the Love Me Again hitmaker even thanked fans for being discreet and just throwing out the Bangtan hand sign that he had previously let them know.</p>

<p><strong>V makes pistachio croissant go viral during the fashion show week</strong></p>

Mr. Kim Taehyung has impressed fans with his visuals and dessert-eating face. The owner of the shop gave a well-deserved shoutout to the singer in a video shot by Daily Fashion News. &ldquo;V, we love you so much! My wife loves you too, and we hope you keep creating wonderful work. We tried to meet you there, but we didn&rsquo;t know. They said you were having a meal. So hopefully, next time we can meet again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had previously shared with the publication that he had heard it was a famous dish in the city, so after checking out the jam-packed Celine show, he revealed his plans of heading to try it out. Subsequently, the star was seen animatedly chowing down on a pistachio croissant alongside his security personnel and team of managers. One of them was spotted holding a pistachio ice cream in his hand, likely also for the singer, as they giggled about, after all of them checked out the famed pistachio croissant.</p>

<p>The already trendy delicacy has now gone absolutely viral thanks to the BTS member&rsquo;s recent visit to a spot famous for nut-based desserts, La Pistacherie. In turn, it became one of the most talked-about moments from this year&rsquo;s Paris Fashion Week. V truly knows how to make it all about him, and we can&rsquo;t get enough of it!</p>

Actor seemingly deletes Lovestagram pics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Jung Il Woo is leading by love! The 38-year-old actor hinted at his new relationship in a new Instagram update, only to delete it shortly after. And while the star has never spoken about him dating the woman in concern, many are convinced that it was indeed Lovestagram photos that made it to the actor&rsquo;s public account, instead of probably his private one meant for his close friends, and were soon taken down. Now, many are waiting for him to comment on the swift deletion and his sweet remarks in the image.</p>

<p><strong>Jung Il Woo hints at a relationship with a food brand CEO</strong></p>

<p>On October 9, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/boys-over-flowers-reunion-lee-min-ho-and-kim-bum-snapped-with-jung-il-woo-fans-want-them-to-work-together-again-1288871">Jung Il Woo</a> shared a couple of updates on his Instagram story. He could be seen taking a photo of a person sitting in front of him at a cafe. Dressed casually, his white T-shirt and good looks made for a total &lsquo;boyfriend material&rsquo; photo, which was captioned &lsquo;Good day&rsquo; with a pink flower emoji beside it. The other picture, seemingly taken by the actor himself and of the lady sitting opposite him, showed a woman in a matching white shirt look, hidden behind a cat face sticker. The same phrase made it to the photo with the actor tagging himself and the woman&rsquo;s account on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seemed to have been taking place while sitting together on the same table, in the middle of a meal, it was the matching outfits, the tags, and the sweet comments from them that raised dating rumors. However, what many believed was bigger proof was their matching phone cases. The actor boasted a green colored, patterned case, while the person behind the cat sticker had the same one in orange. Moreover, couple bracelets in black could be seen on both of their left hands as they snapped away from the other one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quick deletion from the actor raised more questions, while fans online began digging into the woman&rsquo;s identity. They soon claimed that it was none other than Park Ji Soo, CEO of the plant-based alternative food brand Innohas. Interestingly, Jung Il Woo collaborated with the brand for their plant-based project.</p>

<p>According to a post from an OP who witnessed the two on a date, Lee Chae Min and Ryu Da In grabbed a meal at a nice restaurant. The person working there praised their visual chemistry, calling him &lsquo;handsome&rsquo; and her &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo;. They also added that the actor made some savory pancakes himself to serve them to his girlfriend, proving his continued love for her. He also sweetly responded to them, asking for an autograph and gladly signed one. The incident is said to be very recent and post the airing of Bon App&eacute;tit, Your Majesty.</p>

<p>During an interview, the 25-year-old actor also addressed <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/did-bon-appetit-your-majestys-lee-chae-min-engage-in-lovestagram-with-gf-ryu-da-in-for-25th-birthday-post-actor-reveals-1397341">Lovestagram rumors</a> over the use of similar birthday candles for each of their celebrations. He called it a coincidence and expressed gratitude for the increased interest in his life. Simultaneously, he was also asked about wearing couple rings at the wrap-up party of Bon App&eacute;tit, Your Majesty with Ryu Da In, to which he decided to keep it a secret and shared that he only grabbed it to wear it as a fashion accessory.</p>

On October 4, 2025, the South Korean airport became another star-studded affair as swarms of photo journalists, fans, and bodyguards, as well as K-pop label staff members, crowded for the right spot to snap away. Three of the biggest stars of the country strutted into the airport as BTS&rsquo; V, BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie, and EXO&rsquo;s Kai, all with alleged romantic connections, flew to France for individual appearances at the ongoing Paris Fashion Week.</p>

<p><strong>V, Jennie, and Kai were spotted at South Korean airport at the same time</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s a known fact that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jennie-joins-diplo-on-stage-during-ibiza-set-fans-share-mixed-reactions-amid-ongoing-tour-1395535">BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/how-did-exos-kai-help-kpop-demon-hunters-lead-star-jinu-creator-spills-beans-on-monsta-x-and-shinee-inspiration-1394769">EXO&rsquo;s Kai</a> used to date in the past. Agencies of both K-pop superstars admitted to their romantic relationship and left the mouths of their fans agape. However, their busy schedules brought an end to the dating phase. Only a few months later, news of their breakup surfaced on the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A couple of years later, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-fans-for-ignoring-him-while-running-10-km-at-han-river-and-doing-bangtan-gesture-know-what-happened-1397192">BTS&rsquo; V</a> and BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie began to be interlinked to each other. With alleged photos of their Jeju vacation and a walk to the River Seine in 2023 making rounds online, the opinions were divided. Neither of their labels commented on the dating rumors, and the military enlistment of Kim Taehyung put an end to the speculations. However, post his discharge, the rumors resurfaced and haven&rsquo;t calmed down so far.</p>

<p>Now, BTS&rsquo; V, BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie, and EXO&rsquo;s Kai were all spotted at the airport within hours of each other, all traveling to Paris for Celine, Chanel, and Lacoste, respectively. The timings of their spotting at the airport make us believe that they must be on the same flight, and fans have now termed this moment, The Summer I Turned Pretty K-pop version, in line with the viral show starring Lola Tung, Christopher Briney, and Gavin Casalegno. Their love triangle is being compared by fans online, despite the BTS member and the BLACKPINK member never actually confirming their relationship.</p>

An avid collector of pieces from his home country and around the world, his new venture will allow the singer to showcase the many well-known modern and contemporary artworks via an exhibition. These pieces are said to be a mix of the singer&rsquo;s own collection as well as those under the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) banner. Tickets for the exhibition will be made available in the future, with the announcement for the same having been made over a year in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS&rsquo; RM announces foray into art exhibition world</strong><br />
On October 3, a notice from his label revealed RM&rsquo;s plans to conduct an exhibition in the coming year. Lasting for about five months, from October 2026 to February 2027, the same will be held at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), San Francisco, California, USA. With the details like the dates and ticketing yet to be made public, fans are already excited for having a look at the BTS member&rsquo;s personal collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the artists whose pieces will be displayed at the exhibition include &lsquo;key figures of modern and contemporary Korean art represented in the collection of RM- Yun Hyong Keun, Park Rehyun, Kwon Okyon, Kim Yun Shin, To Sangbong, and Chang Ucchin.&rsquo; On the other hand, SFMOMA&rsquo;s collection comprises artworks by Korean artist Kim Whanki as well as American and European artists such as Mark Rothko, Agnes Martin, Henri Matisse, Georgia O&#39;Keeffe, and Paul Klee.

About 30 minutes before giving the speech, he suddenly called me. He said, &lsquo;Fighting! I have a video I watch whenever I get nervous, so I&rsquo;ll send it to you.&quot;The people there [in the audience] will be watching you with a light heart, but you&rsquo;ll be the only one getting nervous. So don&rsquo;t worry and do it comfortably.&rsquo;&quot;</p>

<p>Realizing he was being truthful, the TXT member felt relaxed, &quot;When he said that, I realized he was right! It was a cheerful place. Thanks to him personally cheering for me, my heart felt so much lighter. I had trouble sleeping till 5 am-6 am the previous night because I was so nervous. But since I wrapped it up well, that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p>

Well, think again. The singer surprise dropped the announcement for a couple of days of encore concerts at the end of this month. To be held at the Incheon Munhak Main Stadium, the two shows will take place on October 31 at 7 pm KST and November 1 at 6:30 pm KST. It was also revealed that apart from the in-person attendance, the shows will also be made available for online livestreaming for the fans of the singer globally.</p>

<p><strong>BTS member Jin announces RUNSEOKJIN_EP.TOUR encore</strong></p>

<p>Jin will be returning for surprise encore shows of his RUNSEOKJIN_EP.TOUR. The announcement was shared with fans on October 2, 2025. After many fans expressed their interest in attending the tour, it seems that the management of the singer has listened to them and arranged for special concerts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A separate note in the announcement included the possibility of a change in schedule due to the venue&rsquo;s restrictions. &ldquo;This concert may be postponed by one day, depending on the sports event schedule. In such a case, updates will be provided via the In-Person Concert Ticketing Guide before ticket sales open. Please ensure you check the notice to avoid any confusion regarding the ticketing schedule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Jin previously expressed his despair about not having the time or the place to arrange for encore concerts owing to the last-minute preparations of his solo tour, the fans kept asking him for it, and their wishes have been granted. One such fan asked the singer why the announcement was so sudden and said that they could not attend on short notice. To this, Jin apologized and revealed that no concert venue was available for the singer, but one just opened up about three weeks ago and after thinking about the possibility of doing it and juggling the work on BTS&rsquo; group album, he decided to just go for it. However, he is yet to actually start working on the encore concerts.&nbsp;</p>

Soon after, he returned to his hotel to turn on a livestream and interact with his fans. Sharing about the group&rsquo;s plans for working together on their spring 2026 album, he added how the team had been going hard at it. Comments asking about his possible return as a soloist were spotted by the singer, who then made it clear that his focus was on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-not-most-popular-celebrity-in-south-korea-surprising-tv-star-takes-over-most-influential-list-1395810">BTS</a> music at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jimin opens up on solo music plans while working on BTS&rsquo; comeback album&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Dior show in Paris was graced by BTS member Jimin&rsquo;s presence, marking his first fashion appearance since his military discharge in June. After making practically everyone wide-eyed with his look, the star went on Weverse for his first solo livestream in 2 years.</p>

<p>Looking at the many requests in the comments section, speaking about his individual music releases following the success of FACE and MUSE, he decided to address them once and for all. &ldquo;There are some (comments) asking when my next solo [music] is coming out. But as you know, Bangtan (BTS) is the most important to me and that&#39;s what I gotta do, so.. [we&rsquo;ll get to it] later.&rdquo; His words promptly silenced any questions about putting his own interest before that of his team, and made it clear that he would surely drop more solo music, but after working on the BTS album, releasing it, and touring around the world to promote it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next year, after its [album is] out, I&#39;ll have to go around meeting you guys [on tour],&rdquo; he added about holding shows in the coming year, BTS&rsquo; tour after 7 long years.&nbsp;</p>

Taking on the role 1 month before the filming began, after the abrupt exit of Park Sung Hoon over a personal controversy, he nailed his embodiment of King Yi Heon of the Joseon Dynasty. Apart from his performance, it was his <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/who-is-lee-chae-min-dating-bon-appetit-your-majesty-stars-couple-ring-with-girlfriend-gets-fans-talking-1396592">matching couple ring</a> seen at the wrap-up party of the show that caught many fans&rsquo; attention. Recently, his 25th birthday post also came under the spotlight for having the same candles as his girlfriend Ryu Da In&rsquo;s own cake. Now the actor has responded to &lsquo;Lovestagram&rsquo; rumors, claiming it wasn&rsquo;t intentional!</p>

<p><strong>Lee Chae Min and Ryu Da In&rsquo;s love story progresses</strong><br />
Speaking to SPOTV News, he emphasized how his personal life does not affect his professional one, and instead only encourages him to do better. &ldquo;Rather than being pressured by being in a public relationship, it gives me more passion to immerse myself in the role.&rdquo; He added that they do not exclusively discuss their projects.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-chae-mins-admiration-for-yoona-at-bon-appetit-your-majesty-party-moves-fans-many-demand-modern-k-drama-1397175">Lee Chae Min</a> also addressed whether he was engaging in Lovestagram, a common slang used for couples who hint at their dates with photos from the same locations or secret actions declaring their love but not being outright. The similar candles on his and Ryu Da In&rsquo;s 25th birthday cakes raised questions, but the actor flat-out denied it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true. I suddenly thought about it yesterday, because it shows how much attention we&rsquo;re getting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their wearing similar rings at the closing ceremony of Bon App&eacute;tit, Your Majesty, was also brushed aside as a coincidence. Lee Chae Min said, &ldquo;I wore it for fashion. I never thought there would be reporters in front of me, and I never thought a photo like that would be taken. We were enjoying food together at the wrap-up party, and if we&rsquo;re going to be picky, it was my mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to whether or not it was a couple ring, the actor kept mum and called it a &lsquo;secret&rsquo;, adding more excitement rather than calming the waters!</p>

Agencies give different razor sharp responses]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-09/388364465_julie-kangmin.webp"></img><p>VERIVERY&rsquo;s Kangmin and KISS OF LIFE&rsquo;s Julie have become the center of attention for their latest dating rumors, which have surfaced over the weekend. According to an initial report, the two stars, along with fellow boy group member Yeonho,&nbsp;were spotted at a private room. Their skinship with each other raises questions about their relationship; however, as the videos leaked online, many others were concerned about the invasion of privacy. Now, both side have given starkly varying opinions on the same, with Jellyfish Entertainment denying any involvement and S2 Entertainment choosing to keep mum.</p>

<p><strong>Julie and&nbsp;Kangmin&#39;s agencies react to dating talk</strong></p>

<p>On September 29, 2025, as per coverage from Xports News, Julie&rsquo;s agency, S2 Entertainment,&nbsp;shared, &ldquo;It concerns [the artist&rsquo;s] private life, so there is nothing the company can comment on.&rdquo; Consequently, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/10-best-7-member-k-pop-boy-groups-1282341">VERIVERY</a>&rsquo;s Kangmin and Yeonho&rsquo;s management team, Jellyfish Entertainment, promptly denied the rumors. &ldquo;The rumor is completely false and is a malicious fabrication that seriously damages the artist&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The alleged video, seemingly filmed at a private bar-like place, displayed a man and a woman hanging out with a third person joining later. With the low quality of the video, their faces could not be recognized; however, online communities soon threw out the names of VERIVERY&rsquo;s Kangmin and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kiss-of-life-dropped-from-kcon-la-just-5-days-after-announcement-following-fan-backlash-over-cultural-appropriation-controversy-1388120">KISS OF LIFE</a>&rsquo;s Julie, as well as Yeonho, as the supposed ones in the clip. Fans of the K-pop stars have demanded the&nbsp;deletion of the video entirely, with legal action being taken regardless of it being the celebrities are in the content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, recently, VERIVERY&rsquo;s Kangmin earned a lot of praise for his appearance on BOYS II PLANET, the Mnet survival show. Initially ranked in the higher ranks, Yoo Kangmin was eventually unable to be a part of the debut lineup, missing it by just one spot. Having placed 9th in the finale round, he could not join <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/what-is-alpha-drive-one-all-about-boys-ii-planet-winners-and-zerobaseones-brother-team-1397211">ALPHA DRIVE ONE</a> alongside Lee Sangwon, Zhou Anxin, He Xinlong, Kim Geonwoo, Zhang Jiahao, Lee Leo, Chung Sanghyeon, and Kim Junseo.</p>

With this, three people of the Park family, led by the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-dynamite-soars-past-2-billion-views-becomes-first-male-k-pop-act-release-to-do-so-1396428">BTS</a> member, have entered the club&rsquo;s first-ever &#39;Three Father-Son Members&#39; faction.

She had climbed onto a chair to share her wish to go on a trip with the cast and crew of the K-drama.

<p>The penultimate week of airing showed the two win over the Ming Dynasty cooks in a best-of-three match with the Chinese chefs admitting their defeat. Subsequently, a meal prepared by YoonA&rsquo;s Yeon Ji Young was used as a way to poison the younger step-brother of Lee Heon, imprisoning her. However, the King was able to prove her innocence and save her from the clutches of royal politics while also demonstrating his unconditional love for the royal chief cook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upcoming finale will inch towards Yeon Ji Young&rsquo;s plans to return home to the current time space, while a revolution brews in the side chamber of Lee Heon&rsquo;s home with his royal consort Kang Mok Ju at the forefront of it.</p>

He carried a black purse, matching that to his footwear with class dripping in each of his steps. His hair neatly styled and glistening under the lights, a few strands fell loosely on his face. With minimal makeup, only glossy skin and a pink, almost-n*de lip shade to go with it, the BTS member let his looks do the talking. For accessories, only a big buckled belt, a matching necklace&nbsp;and ring combo adorned the star.</p>

<p>Heading to check out the short film, The Tiger, from the luxury brand, Jin chatted up American rapper and songwriter Nettspend, who was right beside him at the theatre seating. A clip shot by Allure Korea showed the Korean superstar laughing and quickly buttoning up his shirt, hiding away his beauty. Knowing Jin, that was very on brand for the singer, managing to elicit laughter.</p>

The confirmation of its two leads was done a couple of months ago, with questions being raised about the unexpected casting of Kim Jae Won who was seen in projects like Hierarchy and King the Land, among others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, Yumi&rsquo;s Cells began with the lead star&rsquo;s love story with a man named Goo Woong (Ahn Bo Hyun), which ended soon after. The second season focused on her passionate romance with Park Jin Young&rsquo;s Yoo Babi, becoming her boyfriend instead of just being an observer like in the first one. Lee Yubi, Jo Hye Jung, and Baek Na Hee are all set to have important roles in the upcoming season, with Choi Daniel joining in as the other male lead.</p>

Going so far as to do a full bow when J-Hope danced to the group&rsquo;s GO challenge, the younger ones have always been all praise for the senior team. In an interview with W Korea, the star has once again credited his wisdom to that of the septet&rsquo;s leader. Being in the commanding position, much like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-calls-fans-his-greatest-strength-despite-ups-and-downs-reveals-what-members-tell-him-often-you-did-well-but-1395606">RM</a>, Martin quoted the Indigo singer and revealed how his humbling words of working hard when the team has low morale have provided him encouragement.</p>

<p><strong>BTS&rsquo; RM and CORTIS&rsquo; Martin have a lot to talk about, especially their captaincy</strong><br />
Martin shared how his own sibling introduced him to BTS and thereby turned him into a fan of RM, who immensely influenced him. Subsequently, entering the Purple world, he had the opportunity to join the company and debut under the same label. &ldquo;Watching them gave me certainty about which company I wanted to join and what kind of music I wanted to make,&rdquo; shared the 17-year-old.</p>

<p>One of the most important pieces of advice imparted by one leader to another has been his go-to, &lsquo;When the members are exhausted, it&rsquo;s the leader&rsquo;s role to help bring their energy back up.&rsquo; Martin has inculcated the habit into his own actions while leading the CORTIS bunch. Adding to it, RM, who is known for his poetic lyrics and wise, learned thoughts, has given some amazing quotes during his interviews, one of which has stayed with the younger one. &ldquo;The leader&rsquo;s seat is just the farthest spot at the end of the trophy. Without the team, success could never have been achieved.&rdquo; Martin revealed that he has &lsquo;kept those words close to my heart ever since.&rsquo;</p>

<p>BTS and CORTIS made their debut 13 years apart, but fans are already excited to check out their interactions.</p>

Having previously dropped on January 24, 2025, the medical drama went on to receive much praise from viewers, getting an unexpected response to the show. The 8-part series has since been involved in multiple rumors about possible next seasons, with the latest one being denied by the OTT platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call gears up for sequel</strong><br />
A continued production for The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call is seemingly being eyed following the success of the pilot season. With the possibility of 2 parts being planned and shot consecutively, the hopes are high. Speaking about the sequel, Netflix shared its stance, saying, &quot;We&#39;re reviewing the sequel, but nothing has been confirmed yet.&quot; A response to the rumors has instead raised expectations from the production, as the &lsquo;maybe&rsquo; is being observed as a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; for the fans of the show.</p>

<p>The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call follows the life of a genius doctor and ex-mercenary combat medic. Named Baek Kang Hyuk (Ju Ji Hoon), his history with trauma surgery has him become the director of the Trauma Unit that became a Trauma Center at Hankuk National University Hospital. There, he meets a smart and scholarly doctor doing his fellowship, Yang Jae Won (Choo Young Woo), who, after much trouble, is accepted as his first disciple, and the two thus begin their journey as two skilled medical professionals who tackle complex trauma cases with wit and grit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They are aided by nurse Cheon Jang Mi who boasts 5 years of experience at the Trauma Unit at Hankuk National University Hospital and becomes their helping hand with tricky cases. With a unique approach to medicine and nothing off the table, these professionals are put into odd spots while dealing with peculiar cases at the hospital.&nbsp;</p>

It is the company&#39;s 5th official international branch after its main headquarters in its homeland of South Korea, followed by overseas businesses in Japan, the US, Latin America, and China.</p>

<p><strong>HYBE comes to Mumbai with a new will to take over the Indian market</strong><br />
With Mumbai being the heart of entertainment in India, and especially its Hindi film industry, Bollywood, HYBE is seemingly aiming to tap into the massive 1.4 billion market in the country, bringing its own unique approach. The agency is likely to bring a new take on the entertainment landscape, combining its expertise in the field along with India&rsquo;s own strong cultural practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the increase in popularity of K-pop in India and the ever-growing need to attend to its masses, HYBE India has a large audience to cater to and introduce to its expert ways of music and cultural content.

Moreover, its US label has given rise to girl group KATSEYE, which has set itself apart from its peers and begun a virality of its own, spreading to international fans, showing the label&rsquo;s ability to sustain internationally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exact plans for the Mumbai branch are yet to be revealed; however, it is known that the new subsidiary will hold local auditions in India to recruit talent and bring its rigorous training system to the market while making changes for the desi audiences.

<p>As per reports on Soompi.com, Kim Yoo Jung and Kim Do Hoon&rsquo;s agencies have made it clear that there is nothing between the two.

Their dating rumors are not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kim Do Hoon&rsquo;s agency PEAK J Entertainment let out a similar post which read, &ldquo;The dating rumors between Kim Do Hoon and Kim You Jung are not true. It was a group trip attended with the directors of their recent drama, and it was not just the two of them.&rdquo;</p>

Revealing the one rare moment when she did talk about a script, &rdquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;d ask him to run lines with me.

I asked him to check out the script. When we read lines, if he makes them weird, I even scold him, &#39;Do it right! Is this all you can do? He laughs. I don&rsquo;t know why we&rsquo;re like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking about the tacit understanding between the two in another aww-worthy moment, she continued, &ldquo;My husband and I, you may be surprised, but we don&#39;t talk much about work, especially him. We also don&#39;t ask where the other person has been or if the filming was difficult. We can tell just by looking at each other&rsquo;s faces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her statements incited laughter from the cast, crew, and reporters present.&nbsp;</p>

From K-pop stars to Western celebrities, many have found their home on the app and made it easier for their admirers to chat with them! However, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/rm-talks-about-pressure-of-being-bts-but-asks-fans-to-trust-in-group-reveals-status-of-album-prep-so-burdensome-1396786">BTS</a> member&rsquo;s latest suggestion is more beneficial for fellow K-pop idols.</p>

<p>The Layover singer wrote, &ldquo;Looking for other artists to do a broadcast with, not a (BTS) member though&rdquo;. TWS&rsquo; Dohoon and Kyungmin soon dropped a reply with shocked emojis, &ldquo;We really want to do it. Sunbaenim (senior), if you&rsquo;re not asleep by now we&rsquo;d like to join your live. This is Kyungmin and Dohoon from TWS.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The singer has previously dropped by during a TXT livestream led by Yeonjun and Beomgyu during their earlier days, and leader Soobin invited SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Seungkwan for a simultaneous session monitored by both their staff members. Meanwhile Jungkook and Mingyu did an impromptu 4 am stream surprising both fandoms. So this new feature may as well become the way ahead for many K-pop idol interactions henceforth.</p>

Actor clarifies amid fees vs production cost debate]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-09/1790310689_park-hyung-sik.webp"></img><p>Park Hyung Sik is one of the biggest and most successful K-pop idols turned actors in recent years. Following his fame with post-military shows like Happiness and Doctor Slump, he has managed to become a coveted name to have on any K-drama or film lineup. But his presence comes with a hefty price tag. The actor is said to have earned somewhere between 300-400 million KRW for his role as O Gwi, the evil spirit in power. Now, his agency has stepped forward to deny the numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Park Hyung Sik keeps his actor fees a secret&nbsp;</strong><br />
In a statement shared with Newsen on September 17, the Buried Hearts star has dismissed the rumors of earning about 15 percent of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ma-dong-seok-park-hyung-siks-twelve-release-on-ott-when-and-where-to-watch-cast-plot-episode-schedule-and-more-1395756">Twelve</a>&#39;s total production budget of 20 billion KRW. Another 15-20 percent was reportedly given to seasoned actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/who-is-ma-dong-seok-south-korean-actor-reported-to-make-his-telugu-debut-with-prabhas-spirit-1325549">Ma Dong Seok</a> for his lead role as Tae San, the leader of the twelve angels protecting Earth from devils. Check out what R&Ecirc;VE had to say about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/buried-hearts-park-hyung-sik-recalls-facing-bullying-and-bring-singled-out-as-trainee-got-used-to-1380679">Park Hyung Sik</a>&#39;s alleged pay cheque below:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello. This is R&Ecirc;VE Entertainment. We would like to share our official position regarding actor Park Hyung Sik&#39;s per-episode salary rumors. From the initial reports on Doctor Slump to this one on Twelve, the media reports regarding Park Hyung Sik&#39;s appearance fee are untrue. As these reports are becoming established facts, we are sharing our official position. Actor Park Hyung Sik is diligently working on each project he takes on. We would appreciate your warm support for his future activities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twelve depicts the fight between angels and demons with humanity at the center of their dispute. While evil spirits threaten to take over and destroy Earth, 8 out of 12 angels, each representing one of the animals of the Eastern zodiac, unite to tame the terror before them. Other cast include Seo In Guk, Sung Dong Il, Lee Joo Bin, Ko Kyu Pil, Kang Mi-na, and Sung Yoo Bin. The show premiered on August 23 and managed to gather a lacklustre response after 8 episodes.</p>

He wore heeled black shoes to complement the grey oversized kimono-style jacket on top. His mop of hair appeared freshly cut and styled to the T in a ruffled-up look with many piercings peeking out from his ears, lips, and under them. It allowed him to show off the cute, round head side of himself that the fans have come to love and nickname him with. Missing any other accessory, clips from inside the venue showed the SEVEN hitmaker putting on a &lsquo;taco&rsquo; neck piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The singer was then spotted at a dinner party to celebrate the collection in the evening in another all-black monochrome look, complete with a big jacket and black boots.</p>

Speaking to millions of his admirers who had joined the session, he revealed how on the previous night, he grabbed some drinks with fellow member Jimin and even got dinner with V, who could not contain his excitement and began commenting during the live. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-not-most-popular-celebrity-in-south-korea-surprising-tv-star-takes-over-most-influential-list-1395810">BTS</a> leader went on to speak about the preparation that the group has been doing for their upcoming new release set for spring 2026. He promised that the team would bring something new to the BTS ARMY and to wait for a little more time. Moreover, he shared the intense pressure that has been put on the team to produce yet another hit after a 3-year military break.</p>

<p><strong>RM dishes on the pressure people put on BTS for creating impressive music</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about the immense pressure laid on the team for their upcoming release, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-calls-fans-his-greatest-strength-despite-ups-and-downs-reveals-what-members-tell-him-often-you-did-well-but-1395606">RM</a> said,&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so burdensome, honestly. I mean, everyone, imagine you&rsquo;re BTS! You&rsquo;re BTS, but you just got discharged from the military. It took 3 years. You&rsquo;re suddenly back, and everyone&rsquo;s hyping it up already, saying things like, &lsquo;Wow, they&rsquo;re gonna come up with something massive, aren&rsquo;t they? It&rsquo;s pressuring for us too. And we got together and lived together for 2 years- I mean, 2 months, but nothing has changed. We&rsquo;re the same as we were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for how much of their work in relation to the album has already been done, RM shared that the team adopted a completely new system of working on new music. After being in Los Angeles for 2 months, working hard with producers and composers, they&rsquo;ve now entered the latter half of production, with recording yet to happen. The team is said to be working on lyrics and arranging them according to the songs they&rsquo;ve made so far.</p>

<p>Confirming the group&rsquo;s plans for a world tour post the release of their album, he said, &ldquo;We will have the concerts. We&#39;re already having concert-related meetings. Cause next year&#39;s project will be our everything, so we must prepare for it already. So we&#39;ve been having meetings, preparing for the album, discussions on the styling, and then our music.&rdquo;</p>

Netflix allegedly caps actors' fees]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-09/1265177172_byeon-woo-seok.webp"></img><p>Byeon Woo Seok was announced as the lead star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/solo-leveling-live-adaptation-brings-byeon-woo-seok-to-lead-in-sung-jin-wook-role-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-1393363">Sung Jin Woo</a> in the K-drama series adaptation of the popular web novel <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/han-so-hee-to-lead-solo-leveling-live-action-with-byeon-woo-seok-netflix-locks-leads-for-big-korean-project-1396229">Solo Leveling</a>. The announcement was met with a lot of positive reactions from the fans of the actor as well as the story, who have long been waiting for the release of a live-action version. However, according to a latest report from OSEN, the actor may not get paid as handsomely as previously imagined, as studio giant Netflix is said to have enlisted a stricter capping on the fees paid to its talents.</p>

<p><strong>Byeon Woo Seok and other Korean actors&rsquo; fees for Netflix projects under scrutiny&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As per the report, the OTT platform has instructed its team to lower the salaries given to the Korean actors of their scripted and unscripted projects, including limited series and films. Previously believed to be much higher, it has now been capped at around 400 million KRW (about 290,000 USD) to 300 million KRW (about 220,000 USD) per episode. While the number is nowhere near small enough to be called a low salary, the expected payment for Byeon Woo Seok&rsquo;s role was much higher than this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 220K-290K USD appearance fee&nbsp;for Lee Jung Jae for Squid Game&nbsp;is said to have been charged at 245K USD for the first season of the famed show. However, following its vitality reports, it claimed that the actor demanded a whopping 1 million USD payment per episode, eyeing a massively bigger cheque. The amount was never confirmed by the studio or the actor himself, but the estimates left fans surprised.</p>

<p>Addressing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/feels-like-a-new-start-byeon-woo-seok-on-why-he-chose-wife-of-a-21st-century-prince-post-lovely-runner-dishes-on-working-with-iu-1369470">Byeon Woo Seok</a>&rsquo;s possible fees for the project, a source familiar with the situation is said to have remarked that it would be difficult for him to earn more than 300 million KRW (220K USD) due to the concerned policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the OTT platform commented on the alleged capping, saying, &ldquo;Appearance fees are not simply based on the number of episodes but more reasonably reflect the actual time and contribution of creators and cast. Netflix does not enforce a uniform cap. Instead, fees are flexibly negotiated with partners, considering the nature of the project, role, and production period.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the group recently returned from Los Angeles after staying there for a couple of months, working on their new music.

On September 11, roughly a month after an initial court ordered settlement talk ended in a failure, the two sides were given another opportunity to speak about their dispute and sort it on their own. However, the conversations fell apart and the second mediation was not successful in finding two a middle ground. Held at the Seoul Central District Court Civil Mediation Division 41, presided by Judge Jung Hoi Il, the mediation process was held in private, away from any media or onlookers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NewJeans and ADOR fail to resolve their contract issue</strong><br />

After approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes of talks, no conclusion was reached. According to reports from Chosun Ilbo and Korea JoongAng Daily, the latest round of conversations on Thursday afternoon saw no participation from the members&rsquo; end. With the failure of court recommended settlement on August 14 and September 11, the dispute is all set to head towards the announcement of the verdict on October 30.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The court&rsquo;s decision will shed light on the future of NewJeans as a team in the K-pop world and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ador-rejects-min-hee-jins-reinstatement-hybe-label-says-newjeans-as-employees-have-no-say-in-who-is-ceo-1394527">ADOR</a>&rsquo;s management rights over the group. The legal battle first began back in November 2024 after the five members, Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein, announced that they&rsquo;d like to promote individually, citing the violation of their contractual terms on the agency&rsquo;s end. They have demanded the reinstatement of Min Hee Jin, the former CEO of ADOR, and the return of other original employees as the only possible solution to their woes, which the other side has denied. In response, the company expressed its plans to continue managing the girls, claiming a&nbsp;lack of termination grounds.&nbsp;</p>

The members of the team have accused their leader, Ibuki, and her manager of discrepancies in their contracts and hiding their payment details. The dancer also skipped the group&rsquo;s Seoul concert. Now, the concerned manager has reportedly stepped forward to deny the embezzlement claims and share that the alleged &lsquo;fight&rsquo; between the two sides was merely a attempt to ensure proper documentation from the organizers&#39; side.</p>

<p><strong>Ojo Gang unites against leader Ibuki and her manager</strong><br />
A statement was initially shared on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/world-of-street-woman-fighter-episode-4-recap-first-elimination-shocks-viewers-blackpinks-jennie-teases-next-challenge-and-more-1391728">Ojo Gang</a>&rsquo;s official social media account, accusing Ibuki and the manager of pocketing their appearance fees, only to have been deleted soon after. It is being said that the notice was deleted by the manager, who has also locked out the six members from accessing the official page of the group. They then proceeded to share their joint stance on the situation on their personal Instagram accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, a report from OSEN revealed that the members alleged the manager had demanded certain details, including appearance fees of the members, be skipped from their contracts. The members are now claiming that they were blindsided in an attempt to embezzle their money. They have continued to accuse Ibuki and her manager of unfair trade practices.&nbsp;<br />
⁠<br />
As Ibuki skipped the group&#39;s Seoul concert and shared plans also to miss the Busan concert, accusing organizer Root59 of excluding her from talks, the production has stepped forward to share that the delay was from the leader&rsquo;s end. They have doubled down on Ojo Gang&#39;s claims of hiding payment details from the six other members.⁠ This led to the remaining six people performing sans Ibuki after directly getting in touch with the tour organizer.⁠ Meanwhile, she has asked for due co-operation in the upcoming events, including the September 13 concert in Busan, which she claims was unilaterally announced without her presence, citing health reasons.</p>

They have categorically removed the barrier that is often seen among K-pop stars, who often hesitate to talk about the same. With a more Western-focused presence, they are not letting rumors do the talking for them and are instead taking control of the narrative themselves.

According to a recent post from an online user, the singer and actor was caught by a fellow soldier during his training days, only to be demanded to see what was in his uniform&#39;s pockets. A startled but righteous <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/astros-cha-eun-woo-faces-dangerous-mobbing-at-airport-en-route-tokyo-flight-fans-say-let-him-breathe-1393734">Cha Eun Woo</a> did not get intimidated by the situation and was honest as well as upfront about pocketing the plums that were provided during the meal. Assuming they were unripe and needed more time to get to their edible stage, he was carrying it with him only to be called out by the instructor, who informed them that they were, in fact, ready to be consumed. It was followed by a base-wide announcement, informing all military trainees of the state of the plums.</p>

<p><strong>Cha Eun Woo gets called out during military service for the most hilarious reason</strong></p>

<p>An online community post on The Qoo revealed the exact conversation that took place between the military instructor at the Yeoncheon training center, where Cha Eun Woo had enlisted, and the K-pop idol, leading to a briefing from their broadcast room. Check out the exact chat below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instructor: (Looking at his pockets) What is in your pockets?<br />
Cha Eun Woo: They&rsquo;re plums!<br />
Instructor: Why are you taking them instead of eating them?<br />
Cha Eun Woo: I was going to take them and eat them when they are ripe.<br />
Instructor: Those plums can be eaten right now.<br />
Cha Eun Woo: Is that so? I wasn&rsquo;t aware.<br />
Instructor: Broadcast it right away!<br />
Broadcasting room: Ah Ah! (Mic check) Among the fruits prepared today, the plums may look unripe and green, but they are ripe, so they can be eaten right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fans online have found the situation very hilarious, going so far as to research the plum in question and praise Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s calm demeanor. Having <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/save-me-cha-eun-woo-having-a-hard-time-in-military-astros-sanha-reveals-if-hes-adjusting-well-1395089">enlisted at the end of July 2025</a>, the singer and actor is all set to be discharged from his military service in January 2027.</p>

Actor reveals after their 'close friendship' causes rumors]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-09/951169608_jang-theo-and-jung-yujin.webp"></img><p>Jang Theo (also known as Jang Tae Oh) and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/singles-inferno-4-did-yuk-jun-seo-really-ignore-jung-you-jin-cast-members-reveal-truth-in-new-clip-1372343">Jung Yujin</a> (also known as Chung You Jin)&nbsp;have been the topic of discussion among all Korean communities today. Following their participation in the Netflix dating reality series <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/singles-inferno-4-ends-with-4-new-couples-from-kim-a-rin-kook-dong-ho-to-lee-si-an-yuk-seo-know-final-pairings-1371987">Single&rsquo;s Inferno&rsquo;s fourth edition</a>, the two have been spotted together on multiple occasions. Consequently, a report from My Daily surfaced on September 4, 2025, exclusively claiming that the co-stars are currently in a relationship. Now, Jang Theo has stepped forward, denying the rumors and sharing that the two continue to be close friends, and nothing more.</p>

<p><strong>Jung Yujin&rsquo;s relationship with Jang Theo comes under scrutiny</strong></p>

<p>Jang Theo and Jung Yujin&rsquo;s friendship on Single&rsquo;s Inferno 4 became the talk of the town, given&nbsp;how comfortable the two were with each other, right from the start. More than expressing interest among themselves, they cheered on the other one to pursue their interests in other people on the show, often sticking to a more banter-filled relationship. At the end of the show, the two did not end up with any partners but continued to be close friends, resulting in rumors being just chatter. A Korean media report seemingly confirmed that they were indeed moving ahead romantically, but the actor has categorically shut down the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a statement to Ilgan Sports, an official from his side shared, &quot;The dating rumors with Jung Yujin are groundless. The two are nothing more than close colleagues. After the broadcast of Single&rsquo;s Inferno 4, they were on promotional schedules in the Greater China region, and we were helping Jung Yujin with her schedules in the Greater China region, so there were a lot of times when they moved together or our schedules overlapped. Recently, they were seen together at fashion weeks, so it led to a misunderstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jang Theo has appeared in shows like KBS Joy&rsquo;s Love Naggers 2, KBS2&rsquo;s Man in a Veil, and KBS1&rsquo;s The King of Tears, Lee Bang Won.</p>

According to an SBS Star report on September 5, the variety show performer tied the knot to his non-celebrity girlfriend on Friday in the presence of his close acquaintances, family, and friends. It is known that the ceremony was held privately in Seoul, with the Nation&rsquo;s MC <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/yoo-jae-suks-camp-all-about-new-guesthouse-reality-show-on-netflix-from-kians-bizarre-bb-producer-1393492">Yoo Jae Suk</a> acting as the host. Having been friends for a long time and as fellow entertainers in the industry, the two share a close bond. It is only natural that he was invited as the MC for the wedding.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kim Jong Kook weds fianc&eacute;e in Seoul after recent surprise announcement</strong><br />
After dating his girlfriend for a long time, the singer and variety star decided to get married.

A handwritten letter was shared with his fans notifying them of his decision, in line with the 30th anniversary of his debut in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>Previously, Yoo Jae Suk shared on Running Man that Kim Jong Kook had asked him to emcee his wedding only recently. Unaware of his marriage plans, the star had another shoot scheduled on that day; however, with the younger one&rsquo;s request, he canceled his other appointment to be the host to his ceremony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been asked to emcee a ceremony this last-minute,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Having been involved in multiple dating rumors, Kim Jong Kook&rsquo;s wedding announcement was well-received by fans and netizens who congratulated him.</p>

These rumors have sparked massive attention and made them the talk of the town. Recently, the representatives of Suzy have shut down the rumors stating that they are completely false and have no basis in reality.</p>

<p>The marriage rumors began first on social media and were widely shared by various online platforms, causing confusion. The denial from the actress&rsquo;s team may be the end of the story unless new developments surface. But if you are wondering who Kim Byung Hoon is, then keep scrolling to get an insight into his life.</p>

<h2 id="68b2e7b22df2e"><strong>Kim Byung Hoon&rsquo;s business breakthroughs and recognition</strong></h2>

<p>Kim Byung Hoon was born on November 5, 1988. He is the founder and chief executive of APR Corp, which is a South Korean beauty-tech company. This company is known for its tech-infused skincare devices such as Medicube and the Booster Pro. In 2014, Kim founded this company after graduating from university. His early ventures included developing a virtual fitting service and a dating app during his time at Yonsei University.</p>

<p>He started experimenting with cosmetics but then transitioned into at-home beauty devices, which marked a major step for APR. His vision has always been about building something like Apple or Tesla in the beauty industry&mdash;placing technology at the heart of innovation in skincare.</p>

<p>Kim Byung Hoon&rsquo;s company, APR, went public in February 2024, and his 31% stake in the company is estimated at US$1.3 billion. The company&rsquo;s market value stands at a capitalisation of over US$4 billion, and shares have risen roughly 200% this year.</p>

<p>APR gained global popularity through TikTok and other digital platforms, especially with its Medicube brand and Booster Pro device going viral thanks to influencer endorsements, including Kylie Jenner and Hailey Bieber. Despite being a billionaire, Kim is actively involved in day-to-day operations, consumer feedback and weekend strategy sessions.</p>

With his selfie from the studio, there were rumors, but nothing was confirmed. Later, the artist himself shared a mirror selfie with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/did-bts-j-hope-and-v-get-new-tattoos-dr-woos-hope-and-king-ink-hints-raise-questions-1396093">J-Hope and V</a>, where the former&rsquo;s &lsquo;hope&rsquo; tattoo was first seen. The photo sent the internet into meltdown mode, but soon after, there were questions about whether it was even real. The only other known tattoo that he has is a &lsquo;7&rsquo; just above his knee, which is a group ink that the BTS members got to celebrate their time together.</p>

<p>Now, the MONA LISA singer has confirmed that he did, in fact, get tattoos, not just one, but three of them. It remains to be seen if V has also gotten himself inked, as he too was spotted in a selfie with the tattooist.&nbsp;</p>

The supposed video was shot and shared on Song Da Eun&rsquo;s TikTok account many months ago, but has now found itself back on the internet. The video, supposedly shot by the Heart Signal 2 star, shows it being filmed from her POV as she stands in front of an elevator with Jimin allegedly alighting from it, taken aback by her presence. It is not known when it was actually shot or if the person in the video is, in fact, the BTS member.</p>

<p><strong>Song Da Eun shares new &lsquo;proof&rsquo; of dating Jimin</strong><br />
According to the video, the person behind the camera, believed to be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/song-da-eun-reignites-bts-jimin-dating-rumors-with-remarks-on-trouble-with-k-pop-idol-boyfriend-1390552">Song Da Eun</a>, stands in front of an elevator to jump scare the person exiting it. Unaware of being filmed, the clip briefly pans to the face of the star dressed in a casual grey top and black pants, a white mask resting on his chin, barely covering his face. Many speculate that the video was shot at Jimin&rsquo;s residence in Seoul with the singer&rsquo;s familiarity with his surroundings. It appears to be Jimin at first glance; however, the same has not been confirmed by the singer&rsquo;s end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man in the video can be heard commenting, &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t expect you to be there. You knew I was coming up [in the elevator]?&rdquo; With the recording going shaky after that, it remains unclear what the purpose of the clip was.</p>

<p>It has been shared online numerous times among fans of the singer, the actress, and local netizens who are taking it as &lsquo;alleged&rsquo; proof of their long-running relationship. Jimin and Song Da Eun have been linked since 2022; however, the BTS member&rsquo;s side is yet to comment officially on the matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having been taken down since, many fans of the star are claiming it as clout-chasing from the lady&rsquo;s end, who is said to have signed with a new agency, Merry Go Round, for her acting activities. While not confirming the dating rumors, Song Da Eun has previously <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/song-da-eun-sues-online-trolls-takes-legal-action-against-malicious-comments-and-defamatory-rumors-linked-to-burning-sun-1380865">called out the online backlash</a> she has faced over these claims. Meanwhile, Jimin&rsquo;s fans are now demanding that legal action be taken against the video, citing privacy invasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The director told me, &lsquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be better since you said you practised so much.&rsquo; Inside, I was like, &lsquo;How could he say that to me?&rsquo; I had practised for nearly three months.&rdquo; She added how the director further reprimanded her hard work for 3 months, in disbelief that she had taken so long to work on it, but did not produce the expected results, &lsquo;it doesn&rsquo;t really show,&rsquo; he said, shocking the seasoned actress.&nbsp;</p>

Ever since his debut as a part of the septet, he has managed to grab millions of fans, making him one of the most loved celebrities on social media. Countless hashtags going over billions of uses across Instagram, X (Twitter), TikTok and more platforms, his imaginary world has managed another impressive feat. It was reported that among the many words added to the Cambridge dictionary this year, &lsquo;delulu&rsquo; has been a fan favorite, made more palatable by Jimin&rsquo;s fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jimin boosts delulu &lsquo;sales&rsquo; globally</strong><br />
According to a JoongAng report, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jimins-solo-song-letter-gets-stolen-on-music-platforms-fans-demand-swift-correction-take-immediate-action-1395242">BTS</a> member&rsquo;s fans have made it more global and widely acceptable word online thanks to their constant and continued usage of the slang. Meaning, delusional, the initially funny implication has now been heavily linked to fandom culture and the spread of fan service. As per The Times of England (The Guardian), Jimin&rsquo;s fans birthed a viral TikTok trend, with them uploading his photos with the caption &ldquo;revealing my boyfriend&rdquo;, in a perfect example of the use of &lsquo;delulu&rsquo; online.</p>

<p>While many would ridicule it at the start, the word has now become widely acceptable and with its acceptance in the famed Cambridge dictionary, it&rsquo;s unlike to die down anytime soon. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jimin-maintains-most-popular-k-pop-idol-slot-for-197th-week-with-over-18-billion-votes-herere-top-stars-1394171">Jimin</a>&rsquo;s influence has not just made fans take on good deeds and spread social awareness on multiple topics, but also allowed them to engage in fun internet trends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the singer is currently in Los Angeles with RM, Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, V, and Jungkook, as the team works on their spring 2026 comeback album.

What ensued was a sweet love story, unlike any other the online queer community had seen before, resulting in an outpour of tremendous support. With Lee Junseong&rsquo;s dedicated pursuit of the bright, mischievous Shin Seungho, their time on the show resulted in a new relationship which began in January 2023, shortly after the two moved out of the show as a final couple. However, their dating era seems to have come to an end after the two announced their separation via a community post update on their joint YouTube channel. On August 20, the note spoke about how they would be going &lsquo;separate ways&rsquo; and asked for fans&rsquo; support individually.</p>

<p><strong>Junseong and Seongho end their 2-year relationship</strong><br />
Not specifying when the breakup actually happened or what the cause was, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/who-are-his-man-2s-junseong-and-seongho-find-how-gay-dating-show-contestants-became-online-favorites-1238495">Junseong and Seongho</a> shared the sad news with their fans on their YouTube channel, Junseongho&rsquo;s. They also deleted all their couple photos on their personal social media and any traces of the relationship, including removing all videos on their channel, which boasted 367K subscribers.</p>

<p>The post reads:<br />
&ldquo;Hello, this is Junseongho.<br />
Today, we would like to share some rather heavy news.<br />
We have decided to bring our journey together as &quot;Junseonghoney&quot; to a close and walk our own separate paths.<br />
The word &quot;goodbye&quot; feels unfamiliar and difficult, but after much thought, we believe this is the best choice for both of us.<br />
We have received so much love from you all-laughing, crying, and creating memories together-and we will never forget that love for the rest of our lives.<br />
From now on, instead of under the name<br />
&quot;Junseonghoney,&quot; we will do our best individually, as Junseong and Seongho, and greet you with our best selves.<br />
We sincerely thank you for the warm support and love you have given us until now.<br />
With gratitude,<br />
Lee Junseong &amp; Shin Seongho&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is known that Shin Seongho is a freelance makeup artist; meanwhile, Lee Junseong was supposedly working at a department store as a brand representative, but has since moved to content creation, most importantly on YouTube. The future of the couple&rsquo;s YouTube channel is unknown at the moment, as well as their personal living situations after the breakup. They moved in together pretty early in their relationship, and it cannot be said what they&rsquo;ve done since.</p>

With the group&rsquo;s inclining upwards popularity internationally, they&rsquo;ve often been dubbed &lsquo;living legends&rsquo;. However, it seems that domestically, someone else is ruling the hearts and minds of civilians and experts. For the second year in a row, the Sisa Journal conducted a yearly survey that has placed the group at the penultimate spot on the list of the most influential figures in the entertainment industry. Surpassing BTS&rsquo; standards is TV personality <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/yoo-jae-suks-camp-all-about-new-guesthouse-reality-show-on-netflix-from-kians-bizarre-bb-producer-1393492">Yoo Jae Suk</a>, who has remained the top pick from normal people as well as experienced professionals in the field.</p>

<p><strong>BTS gets one-upped by Yoo Jae Suk</strong><br />
With a whopping 39 points difference in their standing, Yoo Jae Suk leads the list for the regular civilians, with over 70 points favoring him, while <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/rm-calls-bts-army-wife-earning-hilarious-wild-reactions-from-jimin-and-jungkook-oh-god-1395757">BTS</a> stands at 31.4 points. They are followed by Kang Ho Dong, known for his hosting and variety skills often seen in shows like Ask Anything (Knowing Bros), with 13.8 points. Tied with him is singer-actress IU, coming in next with her portrayal in When Life Gives You Tangerines, aiding her fame. The top 10 is completed with Shin Dong Youp, Jun Hyun Moo, Lim Young Woong, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-blackpink-headline-rock-in-rio-2026-rumors-swirl-internet-as-alleged-insider-spills-beans-1395791">BLACKPINK</a>, Son Seok Hwi, and Kim Oh Jun.</p>

<p>The expert list does not appear much different for the septet, as they trail behind Yoo Jae Suk with 23.6 points. Here, the top 3 bring in BLACKPINK with a fervor, followed by IU, Kang Ho Dong, Son Seok Hwi, Shin Dong Youp, Na Young Seok, Jun Hyun Moo, and Kim Oh Jun. Singer Lim Young Woong is not included in the professionals&rsquo; list, replaced by Channel Full Moon producer Na PD.</p>

<p>BTS&rsquo; results have taken an improvement, with their civilian standing improving by around 12 points, probably thanks to the members&rsquo; completed military services. The experts have regarded them in a similar ranking as last year, with a growth of only 1.6 points.&nbsp;</p>

Now, another one will be added to his list as the star confirms his plans to get married to an unnamed individual. The 49-year-old has not revealed the exact schedule in his letter to his fans, but has confirmed that it will not be a grand event but limited to &lsquo;family, close friends, and a few acquaintances.&rsquo; With 30 years in the entertainment industry, it remains to be seen what kind of ceremony he will throw.</p>

<p><strong>Kim Jong Kook confirms he&rsquo;s getting married soon</strong><br />
In a new update on his personal fancafe, the Turbo member revealed feeling nervous to write the letter after years of imagining it. Wanting to personally reveal it to those who have supported him as a person, Kim Jong Kook shared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting married. Honestly, I tried to drop small hints here and there&hellip; but I&rsquo;m sure many people would feel that this news is sudden. It&rsquo;s my 30th debut anniversary, and instead of making the album I wanted, I made my &lsquo;other half&rsquo; instead.&ldquo; He promised to work hard to live well with his partner.</p>

<p>The singer shared that the wedding will take place sometime soon on a small scale. In a subsequent statement from his agency to Xports News, TURBO.JK COMPANY said, &ldquo;He will be holding a private wedding ceremony with family and close acquaintances. We cannot disclose the exact date or location.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An SBS representative revealed, &ldquo;During today&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/running-man-denies-reports-of-kang-hoon-leaving-variety-show-clarifies-stance-on-future-appearance-1328215">Running Man</a> opening, Kim Jong Kook directly informed the members about his marriage.&rdquo; It is expected that the episode will air sometime in early September.</p>

<p>Previously, during an appearance on Problem Child in House, Kim Jong Kook revealed buying a 620 million KRW house, raising questions about whether it would be his &lsquo;newlywed home&rsquo;. Back then, he said he would let everyone know after setting the wedding date, and the YouTuber has realized his promise.&nbsp;</p>

The rapper-singer had to cancel his fan event after being rushed to the hospital on August 15, 2025.</p>

<p><strong>GOT7&rsquo;s Jackson Wang hospitalized, leading to fan meet cancellation</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Taiwanese media outlet ET Today, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jackson-wang-drops-magic-man-2-watch-got7-star-take-off-his-past-by-stripping-down-in-made-me-a-man-music-video-1393989">Jackson Wang</a> was rushed to the emergency room and is currently being treated for food poisoning. Jackson&rsquo;s agency, Team Wang Records, officially released a statement regarding the idol&rsquo;s condition.</p>

<p>The rapper-singer was transported to the hospital at midnight and has been advised by the medical team to take necessary rest for recovery. Owing to the unexpected situation, the Music Korea fan signing event was cancelled.</p>

<p>The team expressed their apology for cancelling the event and added that a new signing event will be scheduled. Additionally, the fans who purchased the tickets will receive refunds.</p>

<p>Moreover, Jackson Wang is scheduled to start his new tour titled Magic Man 2 in October 2025. The idol is set to begin his show in Bangkok, Thailand, on October 3 and 4.</p>

<p><strong>Jackson Wang&rsquo;s 3rd studio album: Magic Man 2</strong></p>

<p>Jackson Wang&rsquo;s new album Magic Man 2 dropped worldwide on July 18, 2025. Along with the new tracks, fans were treated to a brand-new music video for the track Made Me a Man.</p>

<p>MAGIC MAN 2 is the official sequel to Jackson&rsquo;s 2022 album MAGIC MAN. Initially planned for a 2023 release, the album faced multiple delays, first to 2024 and finally landing in 2025. Despite the wait, the project arrives with a refined vision and more experimental edge.</p>

<p>Spanning 11 tracks, the album blends genres and emotions, staying true to Jackson&rsquo;s evolving artistry.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Jackson Wang?</strong></p>

<p>Jackson Wang is a Hong Kong-based rapper, singer, and songwriter. After a career as a competitive fencer, he joined the South Korean boy band GOT7, which debuted under JYP Entertainment in 2014.

The question continues to float in the minds of their fans, onlookers, the internet, and everyone who&rsquo;s ever heard of the dispute. Starting out as a contract dispute, the issue has grown much bigger, but at the core of it, the K-pop stars are still trying to get out of their ties to the media giant. In a court-arranged mediation, which was set for August 14, Minji and Danielle attended the exchange as the team&rsquo;s representatives alongside their legal team. According to Chosun Ilbo, after about 80 minutes of talk, the two sides were unable to reach a middle ground. A second settlement date has been set for September 11.</p>

<p><strong>NewJeans and ADOR continue to be at odds</strong><br />
Unlike their previous appearances, where the five members were present, offering their thoughts to the world, the two refrained from sharing their stance during the meeting today, and only smiled at the cameras, saying they&rsquo;re sorry [about not being able to give any more statements]. The group has maintained its demand to leave <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-refuses-to-settle-with-ador-during-second-hearing-of-contract-validity-trust-has-been-completely-broken-1390665">ADOR</a> and thereby HYBE over claims of mismanagement, while the label has continued to deny any such instances and stuck to wanting an amicable way forward for the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein have accused the team behind BELIFT LAB of plagiarising their concepts, dance and style for the debut of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/illits-performance-disrupted-by-booing-but-it-wasnt-directed-at-them-heres-how-newjeans-fan-was-involved-1387990">ILLIT</a>. However, their biggest concern continues to be the removal of Min Hee Jin, who participated in the production of the team, from the CEO position. The singers want her reinstated and share that her removal means major harm to their identity. They have cited a complete breakdown of trust between the two parties as their reason for filing the lawsuit and demanding their exit from the agency.</p>

<p>HYBE, in turn, has alleged that Min Hee Jin wanted to usurp the current management and take control of ADOR, resulting in a separate dispute between the two. If they are unable to reach an outside court settlement on September 12, the final verdict will be announced on October 30, deciding whether the girls&rsquo; contract stands valid.</p>

Her last project was a couple of years ago, so there&rsquo;s been a lot of speculation about what she plans on doing next. Speaking to Asia Kyungjae in an interview, she revealed that the story is far from over. While mostly doing female-centric storylines, it remains to be seen what path she takes next and whether the star couple of the franchise, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/fact-check-did-park-hyung-sik-call-bts-v-immature-kid-exploring-the-truth-behind-viral-clip-1394312">Park Hyung Sik</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/when-park-bo-young-spoke-about-soft-spot-for-strong-woman-do-bong-soon-co-star-park-hyung-sik-since-his-k-pop-days-1350463">Park Bo Young</a>, make an appearance once again.</p>

<p><strong>Is Park Hyung Sik and Park Bo Young&rsquo;s return a possibility? Writer plans next project</strong><br />
Following the release of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/when-park-hyung-sik-confessed-his-love-for-strong-woman-do-bong-soon-co-star-park-bo-young-1339751">Strong Woman Do Bong Soon</a> in 2017, and six years later, the revival of the universe with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/strong-girl-nam-soon-co-stars-byeon-woo-seok-lee-yoo-mi-support-labelmate-jin-goo-on-set-of-ongoing-series-the-auditors-with-food-trucks-1329563">Strong Girl Namsoon</a>, fans have been desperate for the story to be back with another look. The writer Baek Mi Kyung revealed what these shows meant for her and how she created them, saying, &ldquo;While Strong Woman Do Bong Soon aimed to create an interesting female character, Strong Girl Namsoon led me to consider the structures within which female characters are situated and the social conditions under which they struggle. I even began to consider the impact they can have on others.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking about what&rsquo;s next for the series, she added, &ldquo;The upcoming Strong Woman Jangchung-dong&quot; will showcase a more evolved version of this character.&rdquo; The focus will not be on a female role but will &lsquo;explore the concepts of good and evil&rsquo;. As to why she will go the Batman: The Dark Knight way? The famed screenwriter says, &ldquo;In an era where the concepts and definitions of good and evil are becoming increasingly blurred, I believe we need to speak to the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the writer did not share if she plans on bringing back the lead couple from the original series, Park Hyung Sik and Park Bo Young&rsquo;s appearance in the second part proved their importance to the franchise, and their return can be highly expected!</p>

Actress Sofia Wylie turned up the heat with the comments for K-pop group <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-extend-deadline-tour-with-concerts-in-chinas-beijing-national-stadium-fans-predict-tickets-to-sell-like-hot-cakes-1394275">BLACKPINK</a>. What was probably meant as praise for the team turned into criticism online, or maybe it was an intended diss. The group&rsquo;s fandom is not taking it well and has also lashed out against <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/is-katseye-using-bots-for-fake-social-media-hype-netizens-accuse-hybe-of-fraud-say-its-so-obvious-1392756">KATSEYE</a> member Sophia, who dropped a like on the video where Sofia Wylie was heard saying that the K-pop stars are &lsquo;giving nothing&rsquo; these days.</p>

<p><strong>Sofia Wylie goes up against BLACKPINK, here&rsquo;s what happened</strong><br />
Talking to MTV, she said, &ldquo;KATSEYE is my bae. I love KATSEYE. I watch every one of their videos. They just performed at Lollapalooza. My girls are going crazy. And BLACKPINK, I love you. Even though you&rsquo;re giving us nothing right now, I love you still. Always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sofia Wylie&rsquo;s remark about &lsquo;giving us nothing&rsquo; has hit the fans the wrong way. Many are calling it a dig at the group&rsquo;s members&rsquo; dancing and singing, as well as the overall vibe during the team&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-goyang-concert-when-and-where-is-first-deadline-tour-show-taking-place-possible-setlist-and-more-1392928">ongoing tour</a>, which has been inviting some criticism on the internet. Others are linking it to how the quartet has released only 1 song after a wait of 3 years, and that the American actor probably meant that BLACKPINK had not given back to their fans, instead of it being about their performance. But that is about to change as reports of the singers releasing a new album in November are already making the rounds.&nbsp;<br />
It is not known what Sofia Wylie&rsquo;s real intent was, but fans are definitely not happy with her words.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, KATSEYE&rsquo;s Sophia is said to have liked the video, inviting another wave of criticism from the fans to her Instagram, where they&rsquo;re taking her reaction as an agreement to the diss. Instantly, the younger singer&rsquo;s account was flooded with bad comments and painting it as &lsquo;jealousy&rsquo;. None of the involved artists has spoken about the incident since.</p>

According to a report from E Daily on August 12, the boy group member was accused by an unidentified person in November 2024 of stealing a song named <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bigbangs-g-dragon-breaks-silence-on-twices-sana-dating-rumors-he-thought-it-could-1390309">G-Dragon</a> back in the day. The agency has denied the accusations.</p>

<p><strong>15 years later, G-Dragon is under investigation for copying: Here&#39;s what we know</strong></p>

<p>The initial report revealed that the Mapo Police Station in Seoul is currently investigating a complaint filed by composer A in November of last year, which claims that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-goyang-concerts-yg-entertainment-apologizes-for-scam-zero-visibility-seats-we-will-be-1393097">YG Entertainment</a> copied a song he composed without his consent and then produced and distributed it as a part of an album. He is claiming copyright infringement charges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The concerned song is said to be named G-Dragon, which the complainant claims to have been changed to My Age is 13, by YG Entertainment and singer G-Dragon. The composer also alleges that the track was then promoted as a part of the BIGBANG star&rsquo;s live album Shine a Light as the song My Age Is 13 + Storm + Hip Hop Gentlemen + G-Dragon, with a runtime of 4 minutes 15 seconds as the 5th on the tracklist.</p>

<p>After receiving the complaint, police questioned some of the individuals involved in the case and conducted 2 raids, at least one of which was said to be at YG Entertainment headquarters in Seoul. A police official was quoted as saying, &quot;The investigation is currently ongoing and we cannot confirm specific details.&quot;</p>

<p>A follow-up TV report coverage stated that the accuser, Mr. A, also filed a complaint against Yang Min Suk, the current CEO of YG Entertainment and younger brother of Chairman and founder Yang Hyun Suk, and Choi Sung Jun, the CEO of its subsidiary YG Plus.</p>

<p>YG Entertainment has shared its stance, denying the copying and instead sharing that two songs with the same title were listed during the preparation for G-Dragon&#39;s solo concert in 2009.</p>

Thanks to his work in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/after-v-bts-rm-hangs-out-with-oldboy-director-park-chan-wook-fans-wonder-whats-cooking-1392923">Oldboy</a>, Joint Security Area, Lady Vengeance, The Handmaiden, Decision to Leave, and more, he has become one of the faces of Korean filmmaking. So when the news hit the screens this week that he was removed from the Writers Guild of America (WGA), shock spread across the industry. Now, the director&rsquo;s side has denied claims of scriptwriting during the 2023 strike, which called for a complete stoppage of their work, but has not appealed the committee&rsquo;s decision to bar him from the union.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Park Chan Wook removed from WGA: Violation dispute continues</strong></p>

<p>Alongside the South Korean, co-executive producer and co-writer Don McKellar was also booted from the association, citing breaking of WGA rules for their HBO mini-series. According to a statement shared by Allkpop, a representative from Moho Film said, &ldquo;All scripts for The Sympathizer were completed and filming had begun well before the WGA strike commenced on May 2, 2023. Editing is not considered writing under WGA rules, so it was a permitted activity. During the editing process, HBO proposed changes to certain settings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Offering further clarity on the work that went on behind the scenes, they shared, &ldquo;The two (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/park-chan-wooks-no-other-choice-starring-lee-byung-hun-and-son-ye-jin-to-kickstart-30th-busan-international-film-festival-1395087">Park Chan Wook</a> and Don McKellar) held idea meetings to determine whether those changes could be implemented using existing footage&rdquo;. They claimed that creative changes and possible alternatives were explored by the two, keeping in mind the ongoing strike at the time and what it entailed. It was emphasized that &ldquo;they did not write or revise any scripts until after the strike ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has been revealed by Adam Levin in a comment to Variety, nothing really changes for the superstar&rsquo;s career except probably having to pay a heftier retainer. He can still continue to write and direct films and projects in the West, without fearing a boycott from any involved companies or associates. The director has vehemently denied writing, so it remains to be seen what comes of this investigation. George Clooney, Sylvester Stallone and George Lucas are some of the many who have previously left the union themselves.</p>

While interacting with the host Martin Nievera, a surprising and heartwarming moment took him by involving his wife Son Ye Jin, which left him smiling</p>

<p><strong>What left Hyun Bin smiling when fans mentioned his wife Son Ye Jin?</strong></p>

<p>Hyun Bin met his Filipino fans for the first time on August 8, 2025, at a hotel in Para&ntilde;aque City. During the event, the host asked whether he had taken home any souvenirs from his former shows, like a prop or costume.</p>

<p>However, even before Hyun Bin could respond, the crowd erupted in excitement, loudly shouting his wife&rsquo;s name, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-is-son-ye-jins-luxury-22-4-billion-krw-gangnam-building-struggling-to-find-tenants-heres-the-shocking-reason-1376547">Son Ye Jin</a>. In a video from that event, the South Korean actor appeared momentarily confused about what the audience was chanting. He stepped towards a section of the crowd to understand them.</p>

<p>Soon, a fan came forward and explained they were calling Son Ye Jin his &lsquo;souvenir,&rsquo; which made Hyun Bin burst into laughter. As he walked back to his seat, he turned to the host and replied with a smile, &ldquo;She told me, my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still smiling, the actor went on to answer the original question about actual souvenirs he kept from previous shows. He said, &ldquo;Whenever I do a project, and afterward if there are any props to commemorate it, I will talk to the props team and ask if I can get one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one that I remember right now is that during Secret Garden, it was Kim Joo-won&rsquo;s nameplate on his desk. After I got that one, it was on my personal desk for a long time,&rdquo; Hyun Bin added.</p>

<p><strong>Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin&rsquo;s relationship</strong></p>

<p>Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin worked together for the first time in the 2018 movie, The Negotiation. They later reunited on the popular K-Drama, Crash Landing on You (2019-2020), from which they pursued a relationship.</p>

<p>Eventually, both actors tied the wedding knot in March 2022 and welcomed their first child the same year.</p>

With so many members come millions of fans, and the craze of knowing every step of the singers. Infamous for following the group&rsquo;s members on their vacations, among other private schedules, SM Entertainment has rolled out a new notice advising the fans against their uncalled-for behavior.</p>

<p><strong>NCT declines gifts at airports, here&rsquo;s why</strong></p>

<p>In a new statement shared on the group&rsquo;s social media, the agency asked fans not to excessively follow the stars, especially at the airport, which is used by thousands of others and is not a private space. This not only violates their privacy but also creates unnecessary ruckus, including moments when people try to make forcible contact, take photos during immigration or security checks, and give gifts or letters to the singers. As such, they have announced that henceforth, no gifts or letters will be accepted at the airport.</p>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t all, as SM Entertainment shared incidents of sasaeng fans canceling or changing the flight details of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/taeil-edited-out-from-nct-127s-walk-video-promotions-amid-sexual-crime-case-fans-react-1346248">NCT</a> members, which has caused trouble with their plans. The company could view this as an obstruction to business and demand damages if the same continues in the future. They have warned against obtaining their private information or disturbing them during flights, booking tickets on the same flight&nbsp;as the singers or following them to the airports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, approaching or keeping track of their private plans has been severely disproved, warning against buying illegal information. The fans have been asked to stay away during their unofficial work to avoid security concerns. This includes not visiting their dorms, waiting outside their hotels or taking photos of their private lives, as well as following ot blocking their private and company vehicles to try to approach them. The agency vows to do its best for its artists and hopes the fans will cooperate.</p>

Within hours, he had gathered thousands of fans, with disbelief spreading across the fandom and on the internet.

<p><strong>BTS reigns as the most followed K-pop act on Instagram in the last 24 hours list</strong></p>

<p>After launching the account earlier in the year and revealing it on July 15, Jungkook has managed to garner 10.2 million followers, a number far from his 50 million record previously.

With the maknae leading, having added over 229K in just 24 hours, V appears in the second spot, gaining over 47K followers in one day. The young guns of BTS surely rule social media, as Jimin falls at the 3rd spot with over 35K added to his own.</p>

<p>SUGA, Jin, and J-Hope appear at 4th, 5th and 6th spots, each growing by over 32K, 30.7K and 30.2K respectively. The BTS all-kill is interrupted with KATSEYE coming in at the 7th place, experiencing a rise in popularity thanks to their explosive Lollapalooza 2025 performance. The girl group managed to invite over 29K fans to their Instagram. RM with his doggie profile picture enters at the 8th spot with over 28K followers, and the team&rsquo;s official account (bts.bighitofficial) grabs over 26K of its own.</p>

<p>Clearly, BTS is still ruling Instagram as some of the most beloved K-pop acts, and they&rsquo;re unstoppable.&nbsp;</p>

His personal life came under the spotlight as it was revealed that he had a son with influencer and model <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jung-woo-sungs-ex-girlfriend-and-babys-mom-moon-gabi-clarifies-relationship-timeline-with-actor-says-never-asked-for-marriage-1364736">Moon Gabi</a>, away from his <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jung-woo-sung-confirms-breakup-with-girlfriend-denies-double-dating-allegations-with-moon-gabi-1362809">long-term relationship</a>. The actor admitted to being the father in November 2024, six months after the birth of the child. Now, it seems that he has decided to register his marriage with his partner. The actor&rsquo;s agency has remained very tight-lipped about the many controversies so far.</p>

<p><strong>Jung Woo Sung&rsquo;s side reacts to the news of a secret marriage</strong><br />
According to reports on August 5, My Daily shared that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jung-woo-sung-and-alleged-non-celebrity-girlfriends-pictures-leaked-online-amid-moon-gabi-controversy-agency-issues-response-1359780">Jung Woo Sung</a> had recently registered his marriage with his longtime girlfriend of 10 years and was already sharing the news with acquaintances who knew about their relationship. It is not known when they actually registered the marriage or if a ceremony will be planned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To this, his management label Artist Company, told TV Report, &ldquo;We cannot give an official confirmation on the reports related to actor Jung Woo Sung&rsquo;s marriage registration, as it is his private life. We request that people refrain from excessive interest and speculation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously, after much speculation around his response, he announced full dedication to his family via his label. During his appearance at the 45th Blue Dragon Film Awards on November 29, Jung Woo Sung personally addressed the issue. Looking solemn, he spoke to the room full of fellow actors, directors, and crew, &ldquo;I stand here hoping that my personal life won&#39;t affect the film (Harbin). I will take all the blame and embrace it. I will fulfill my responsibility to my son until the end, as a father.&rdquo;</p>

ASTRO’s Sanha reveals if he’s adjusting well]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-08/1819281226_cha-eun-woo.webp"></img><p>Cha Eun Woo, the famed singer from boy group ASTRO and actor known for projects like True Beauty, has enlisted in the military, but it&rsquo;s not all sunshine and rainbows for the star himself. Less than a week into his mandatory service, the K-pop star has spoken up about his time training as a soldier. Teammate Sanha shared an anecdote with his fans, talking about the ASTRO group chat. He said that the older member wondered how others managed to survive the training. Another user online revealed that fellow enlisted soldiers were staring at the singer-actor to the point that their instructor had to reprimand them.</p>

<p><strong>Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s first week in the military</strong><br />
Talking to his fans on a community chatting platform on August 3, Sanha revealed <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/buzz-cut-fails-to-take-away-cha-eun-woos-charm-star-hangs-out-with-astro-members-before-military-enlistment-1394661">Cha Eun Woo</a>&rsquo;s naive but sincere question the past Saturday, August 2. &ldquo;Eun Woo hyung suddenly said, &lsquo;How did MJ do it? Save me&rsquo;,&rdquo; he delved into the contents of their chat, speaking about the oldest member of ASTRO, MJ, who completed his military service a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The message seems to have come in during&nbsp;the 1 hour of cell phone time that is supposedly given to the trainees at the end of each day. &ldquo;Even our physically fit Eun Woo hyung seems to be having a hard time. But I think he&rsquo;s adjusting well,&rdquo; he added. The last bit seems to have induced a collective sigh of relief within his fandom, who were worried about the handsome star.</p>

<p>Having enlisted on July 28 at the Korea Army Training Center in Nonsan, South Chungcheong Province, Cha Eun Woo will be a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/pics-cha-eun-woo-chops-off-locks-for-military-enlistment-fans-are-not-ready-for-absence-1394230">part of the military band</a> after completing the rigorous application process. He will be training for 2 weeks, followed by about 18 months of compulsory duty. If everything goes well, he will be out by January 27, 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another incident emerged online where a user shared that their boyfriend is in the same training center as Cha Eun Woo and experienced constant staring from fellow soldiers. To this the training assistant warned them to stop looking at him, adding that he was just a human, much like themselves.</p>

The 2025 Busan International Film Festival, famously known as BIFF, has announced its plans to have esteemed director Park Chan Wook&rsquo;s upcoming project as its upcoming release. Marking his return to the film festival after 3 years, since the premiere of Decision to Leave (2022), which received global praise, he seems to be eyeing another Best Director win, albeit not at the Cannes Film Festival but back at home, this time around.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s No Other Choice about?</strong></p>

<p>Capturing the desperate thoughts of people without jobs, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/no-other-choice-lee-byung-hun-struggles-to-sustain-family-and-son-ye-jins-support-in-upcoming-park-chan-wook-film-1394258">No Other Choice</a> follows <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-byung-hun-gets-cheeky-response-from-wife-lee-min-jung-after-he-thanks-her-for-sending-food-truck-on-sets-of-no-other-choice-1366884">Lee Byung Hun</a>&rsquo;s Man Su, who ends up in a fix after suddenly losing his job one day. He is fired after 25 years of service at a paper mill, and with no way to earn, he comes to a loss about saving his home, which he has worked hard to build. He wishes to protect his family- Mi Ri (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-is-son-ye-jins-luxury-22-4-billion-krw-gangnam-building-struggling-to-find-tenants-heres-the-shocking-reason-1376547">Son Ye Jin</a>), their two children, Si Won and Ri Won, and their two pet dogs, and tries his hardest to survive in the cutthroat world.</p>

<p>It is, however, not simple for the world to trust or bear a man with no work, as he tries his best to land something. Many odd jobs and failed attempts lie in his path, with other strange people falling in his way to gain back his peaceful life. Other characters in the film include Seon Chul (Park Hee Soon), Beom Mo (Lee Sung Min), A Ra (Yeom Hye Ran), and Si Jo (Cha Seung Won).</p>

<p>The director and the lead actor are reuniting for the third time after Joint Security Area and Three&hellip; Extremes. No Other Choice is eyeing a September release, following which it will also premiere internationally at the Venice Film Festival.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 30th Busan International Film Festival is all set to begin on September 17 and close on September 26, with the 20th Asian Contents &amp; Film Market taking place from September 20-23. Actor Lee Byung Hun will be acting as the host for this year&rsquo;s opening ceremony.</p>

Lee Jun Hyuk&rsquo;s impressive acting in SBS TV&rsquo;s Love Scout with Han Ji Min also impressed the audience, earning him a nod. Moreover, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-j-hope-draws-178k-audience-on-hope-on-the-stage-solo-tour-powers-hybes-85-percent-north-american-revenue-surge-1394989">BTS member J-Hope</a> grabbed attention with his Best Singer win, becoming the first from the group to do so.</p>

The Mona Lisa singer is not just the first from the group to take back this win, but also the first soloist since 2016 to do so. BTS has won the award a total of six times, with the recent years of 2022, 2023, and 2024 being the only exceptions. However, this is the first time a solo member has been acknowledged by the prestigious committee, recognizing his global influence and his broadcasting prowess.

<p>The Best Actor, Entertainer, and Singer awards were given a 30% weightage of viewers&rsquo; votes alongside the judges&#39; evaluations, also calculating their public appeal in addition.

The actress, who is a part of Heart on Wheels, unexpectedly shared episodes from her secret romance with her husband, and this grabbed all eyeballs. Their dating life was full of excitement and included episodes like paparazzi chases and hiding at friends&#39; houses.</p>

<h2 id="688e2659c332d"><strong>Lee Min Jung shared her secret romance story with hubby Lee Byung Hun</strong></h2>

<p>In the broadcast of Heart on Wheels on August 1, the members of the Jeong-siblings were enjoying the beautiful environment of an island village. MC Boom at that time said, &ldquo;I hear celebrities often date on islands or by the Han River,&rdquo; which prompted Lee Min Jung to share her secret date story.</p>

<p>Recalling her story, Lee narrated how she once evaded a paparazzi. The actress added that she kept seeing familiar license plates in front of their houses, and those cars would follow her wherever she went. The cast of Heart on Wheels listened to this story with bated breath.</p>

<p>She continued, &ldquo;I told my oppa (Lee Byung-hun) to make sure to note down his car number. Since it was hard to meet directly, we would sneak meet at a friend&#39;s house and use a friend&#39;s car to see each other,&rdquo; recalling the times when even meeting was a mission.</p>

<p>Lee Min Jung further expressed that she even felt sorry for the paparazzi following them as they used to wait for hours. In the end, these two got caught giving an end to their not-so-long secret romance after paparazzi photos were being made public.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the story, cast members such as Young Tak, Kim Jeong Hyun, and Boom exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s totally thriller-level.

While viewers reacted passionately right after the broadcast, saying, &ldquo;The two look great together,&rdquo; &ldquo;Their love was genuine, and so was their effort,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The meeting itself was a drama.&rdquo;</p>

He continued by adding Cha Eun Woo for visuals, often believed to be the biggest inspiration for the character of Jinu, especially after his Free OST cover with Arden Cho, the voice actor for Rumi. Strong vocalists in the form of EXO&rsquo;s Baekyun or D.O. were his next pick, and adding to that DAY6&rsquo;s Young K, would form his version of the perfect demon group from the animated film.</p>

While the two were previously being considered for the lead roles, according to the latest reports, not only have the castings been confirmed, but the production has also begun. The original had actors Robert De Niro and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/anne-hathaways-plastic-surgery-1352092">Anne Hathaway</a> in the main roles and received a lot of love globally, including South Korea, which prompted a remake in the Asian country.</p>

<p>According to the Korean Film Council&#39;s official website, the film&rsquo;s production is said to be in the pre-shoot stage. And while the concerned individuals have not confirmed it seems that it is scheduled to begin filming next month. It is known that Han So Hee will play the role of Jules Ostin, originally played by Anne Hathaway. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/my-dearest-nemesis-choi-hyun-wook-to-transform-into-a-literature-student-for-lead-role-in-the-boy-in-the-last-row-with-choi-min-sik-1375701">Choi Min Shik</a> will take on the role of Ben Whittaker, originally played by Robert De Niro.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the story of The Intern?</strong><br />
The original film follows the life of Jules Ostin, who is the CEO of a recently begun fashion label. After it goes big in just one year of launching the business, she gets very busy trying to juggle her work and personal life. In comes a 70-year-old intern named Ben Whittaker, who gets hired because of a program. With his past experience in bringing wisdom and advice to the team, he becomes a valuable addition to the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Jules Ostin faces a troublesome time in her marriage, Ben Whittaker helps her to choose her family and the right decisions. On the other hand, he eases her work-life by clearing out the literal and metaphorical clutter. Taking on the job as her chauffeur, he gets close to her family and imparts his knowledge without overstepping. It remains to be seen how the Korean version will enhance the storyline.</p>

Having enlisted for his <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/cha-eun-woo-pleads-with-fans-not-to-forget-him-ahead-of-military-enlistment-internet-says-even-if-i-had-dementia-1394519">mandatory military service</a> on July 28, he is all set to join the ROK military band after receiving basic soldier training for 2 weeks. As such, he will be away for 18 months from the public eye, completing his national duty and only appearing at military events where fans are hoping to catch a glimpse. With little to no communication with the outside world while in service, his family, friends and especially fans will be longing for him. Amid all this, the ASTRO member&rsquo;s management label has issued a guidance letter to his fans, advising them against sending letters or parcels.</p>

<p><strong>Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s side denies support from fans: Here&rsquo;s why</strong><br />
A notice from his agency, Fantagio, addressed to his fandom Aroha read, &ldquo;Cha Eun Woo military base letter and mail delivery guidance&quot;. It spoke about how they are aware of the fans&rsquo; feelings about wanting to send support to the star; however, large amounts of letters and or gifts may interfere with his time in the military, as it gets difficult to manage them. There&rsquo;s a possibility of losing the items during the delivery process, and so they kindly asked his admirers to refrain from sending any such things.</p>

<p>Risking his military life is not an option the company would like to explore; however, if it comes to that, they will have to completely stop the process by implementing penalties and disposing of the items mailed to the star. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Extending the notice to Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s birthday next year and his debut anniversary, they shared that it will be difficult to receive or open any gifts sent to the artist on those days. As such, they will not be accepting any support on those days either. Instead of sending any mail or items to his military base, they have requested that it be directed to the agency headquarters instead. If all goes according to plan, Cha Eun Woo will be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/pics-cha-eun-woo-chops-off-locks-for-military-enlistment-fans-are-not-ready-for-absence-1394230">discharged on January 27</a>, 2027.&nbsp;</p>

Comments described their harmony as beautiful, with several calling them a &#39;powerful duo.&#39; The visual pairing, along with the emotional timing of the cover, made it even more meaningful ahead of his enlistment.</p>

<p>Cha Eun-woo, member of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/astro-confirms-full-group-concert-the-4th-astroad-stargraphy-with-ex-member-rocky-and-special-tribute-to-moonbin-1382511">K-pop group ASTRO</a>, will officially enlist in South Korea&rsquo;s military on July 28, 2025.

Here's why fans think so]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/405058892_untitled-design-18.webp"></img><p><strong>Here&rsquo;s why fans think Jungkook is in South Korea</strong></p>

<p>One fan on social media claimed to have seen Jungkook in South Korea recently. While there is no official confirmation, fans strongly believe that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkooks-instagram-account-gets-verified-with-just-1-post-and-9-million-followers-1394393">Jungkook</a> returned to spend time with his best friend Cha Eun-woo before his enlistment. The two have been close friends for years, along with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/s-coups-and-mingyu-to-become-seventeens-4th-subunit-as-part-of-10th-anniversary-rebirth-project-1393494">Seventeen&rsquo;s Mingyu</a>. This group of 97-liner idols, born in 1997, has often shown their strong bond in public.</p>

<p>Before Jungkook enlisted in the military last year, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/cha-eun-woo-pleads-with-fans-not-to-forget-him-ahead-of-military-enlistment-internet-says-even-if-i-had-dementia-1394519">Cha Eun-woo </a>gifted him a special watch worn by Korean soldiers. Fans believe Jungkook might have wanted to return the gesture and give Eun-woo a warm send-off before his 18-month service begins.</p>

<p>Cha Eun-woo, known as one of the most handsome K-pop idols, is famous both as a singer and actor.

Lawyers frame it as cause for Min Hee Jin’s removal from ADOR]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/775784939_bts.webp"></img><p style="text-align:justify">On July 24, 2025, the highly publicized legal battle between NewJeans and their agency ADOR returned to the Seoul Central District Court. But once again, it ended without a settlement.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The case, aimed at confirming the validity of the group&rsquo;s exclusive contract, is growing more complex with each hearing. Both sides delivered a series of intense arguments in front of the 41st Civil Agreement Division, yet failed to reach a mutual agreement. But what stood out this time was the unexpected mention of another HYBE artist: <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-jung-calls-v-great-source-of-inspiration-recalls-bts-members-viral-dance-moment-where-he-brings-same-passion-as-her-1394522">BTS</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans&rsquo; legal team brings BTS into ADOR feud</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In a move that caught many off guard, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ador-rejects-min-hee-jins-reinstatement-hybe-label-says-newjeans-as-employees-have-no-say-in-who-is-ceo-1394527">NewJeans</a>&#39; lawyers referred to BTS while questioning HYBE&rsquo;s motivations behind its treatment of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-newjeans-finally-return-to-ador-members-set-one-non-negotiable-condition-amid-august-14-mediation-1394460">ADOR</a>. Their core argument implied that ADOR, under Min Hee Jin&rsquo;s leadership, disrupted the internal balance of power at HYBE. This shift, they claimed, became more apparent after NewJeans&rsquo; explosive debut success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;There are many multi-labels, but why does HYBE hate ADOR so much? The reason is that Chairman Bang Si Hyuk made BTS a huge success, but he has never made a girl group successful,&rdquo; said girls&rsquo; legal team,&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The further explained, &ldquo;However, when Min Hee Jin hit it big with New Jeans in just two years, they were happy on one hand, but also wary on the other. When Min Hee Jin directly brought up the unfair push-out and copy issues with HYBE, they immediately started an audit.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The lawyers suggested that NewJeans was being penalized for the very success HYBE had once celebrated. The tension, they implied, was not merely contractual but rooted in deeper competition and a power struggle between ADOR and the parent company.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>BTS mention stirs backlash</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">ADOR chose not to respond directly to the group&#39;s claim. Instead, they proceeded with their next argument in court. So far, HYBE has not released any official statement addressing the BTS comparison.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Meanwhile, the mention of BTS has sparked strong reactions online. Fans and industry observers are now speculating about possible internal rivalries and shifting power dynamics among HYBE&rsquo;s multiple labels. Many ARMYs have also voiced discomfort. They express frustration that BTS is being brought into the legal conflict despite having no direct involvement.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>What&rsquo;s next: Mediation and final ruling</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the unresolved arguments, the court has taken a step forward in trying to guide both parties toward a resolution. It has scheduled a closed-door mediation for 2:00 PM KST on August 14. Both ADOR and NewJeans have been requested to attend in person and come prepared with a formal mediation plan. Should the mediation fail, the court will proceed with a final ruling. It is set to be delivered on October 30, 2025.</p>

Agency reveals]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/1699574062_mijoo.webp"></img><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Mijoo&rsquo;s history with Hanwha Eagles fuels rumor mill</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While the rumor was untrue, fans and netizens alike were quick to piece together what seemed like possible links. Mijoo was born and raised in Okcheon, North Chungcheong Province. She is a self-proclaimed lifelong fan of the Hanwha Eagles, the very team Lee Jin Young plays for.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">She has thrown ceremonial first pitches for the team multiple times. Mijoo has even been spotted participating in their cheerleading and promotional activities. Her enthusiasm for the team is well-documented in her variety show appearances, often expressing her support both on- and off-camera. This deep-rooted loyalty to the Eagles may have unintentionally served as the basis for the false relationship theory, one that now appears to have no merit.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Lee Mijoo&rsquo;s past romance with a Soccer star</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Lee Mijoo&rsquo;s personal life has occasionally made headlines. In April 2023, she confirmed she was in a relationship with national soccer team goalkeeper Song Bum Keun. The two shared a three-year age difference as well. However, less than a year later, in January 2024, rumors of a breakup began circulating.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mijoo eventually confirmed their split through her personal YouTube channel, stating the two had gone their separate ways. The breakup was amicable, and no further details were shared. Since then, Mijoo has remained relatively private regarding her romantic life, until this latest speculation with Lee Jin Young surfaced.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For now, any romantic involvement with Lee Jin Young has been firmly ruled out. Fans can expect more updates from Mijoo only when she&rsquo;s ready to share them on her own terms.</p>

HYBE label says NewJeans as employees have NO say in who is CEO]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/1179981896_njz.webp"></img><p style="text-align:justify">The legal standoff between girl group NewJeans and their agency ADOR continues with no agreement in sight. The latest court hearing was held on July 24 at the Seoul Central District Court&#39;s 41st Civil Agreement Division. Both sides presented their positions with PowerPoint presentations, final arguments, and an exchange of counterpoints.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the tense atmosphere and extended back-and-forth, there was one surprising development: <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-dorm-trespasser-fined-10-million-krw-for-breaking-in-know-why-court-rejected-10-month-sentence-1394346">NewJeans</a>, through their legal team, revealed that the members are not entirely against returning to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-deepfake-case-ador-intensifies-legal-action-against-defamers-amid-ongoing-contract-validity-suit-1392665">ADOR</a>. However, that willingness comes with a strict, non-negotiable condition.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans&#39; condition to return: Restore ADOR to pre-audit state</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In a statement that quickly drew attention, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/le-sserafims-agency-vs-min-hee-jin-third-hearing-gets-rescheduled-to-july-for-kakaotalk-message-dispute-amid-newjeans-row-1392434">NewJeans</a>&rsquo;&nbsp;legal representatives clarified the members&rsquo; position. While they are open to staying under ADOR, it hinges entirely on the label reverting to the internal state it had before the audit in April 2024.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that [the members] absolutely refuse to return to ADOR. If ADOR can be returned to how it was before the audit in April 2024, [they] would be willing to go back,&rdquo; the legal team stated. &ldquo;But if that&rsquo;s not possible, then we hope they will let [the members] go by terminating the contract.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">They were referring to HYBE&rsquo;s 2024 audit of Min Hee Jin, which ultimately led to her removal from the CEO position at ADOR. This is the clearest condition the group has laid out so far in the ongoing legal dispute over the validity of their exclusive contracts.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>ADOR pushes back against NewJeans&rsquo; condition</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In response, ADOR&#39;s legal counsel firmly rejected the group&rsquo;s stance. They argued that contract termination over internal management decisions is not grounds for nullifying a legally binding agreement.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;The board of directors is the one to decide who will be the CEO. It is not something that a celebrity can demand from a management company,&rdquo; the agency emphasized. &ldquo;There is no reason to terminate the contract if such a demand is not met.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">ADOR reiterated that there is no clause in NewJeans&rsquo; contracts linking their activities to ex-CEO Min Hee Jin&rsquo;s leadership. The court acknowledged this point. It stated that the dismissal of Min Hee Jin stemmed from her actions and that her role as producer was never contractually guaranteed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans refuses to return to &#39;changed&#39; ADOR</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the court and ADOR&rsquo;s positions, NewJeans remains firm. They argue that ADOR&rsquo;s identity has changed dramatically since the departure of Min Hee Jin as CEO. This makes it impossible for them to continue under the current leadership.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&ldquo;We can&#39;t go back because it&#39;s no longer the same ADOR that NewJeans trusted and relied on,&rdquo; their legal team argued. The members insist that it&rsquo;s not a matter of control or preference, but one of trust and the environment they were initially promised. Without that foundation, they feel there&rsquo;s no path forward under the current structure.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>What&rsquo;s next: Closed-door mediation</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Although no resolution has been reached yet, the court has not given up on finding common ground. A closed-door mediation session has been scheduled for 2:00 PM KST on August 14. Both sides are requested to attend and submit detailed mediation plans.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This session could serve as the final opportunity for reconciliation before the matter proceeds to a verdict. The sentencing date is set for October 30, leaving just over two months for any potential settlement or restructuring.</p>

However, in recent weeks, its rapid growth began to cause physical discomfort. This unexpected change prompted a medical re-evaluation and led to the urgent decision to undergo surgery in August. Yan An said during the stream, &ldquo;The tumor suddenly grew, causing swelling and pain, which led me to finally decide on surgery.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Yan An&rsquo;s surgery plans</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Yan An shared that he would be shaving his head in preparation for the operation. It&rsquo;s a move that symbolized both acceptance and a practical step ahead of the surgery. He plans to take several weeks off afterwards to fully recover before resuming any work-related activities.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Due to this medical necessity, the idol confirmed that he will not be able to continue shooting any dramas or take part in promotional events during this period. He acknowledged that he had delayed the surgery for quite some time due to his busy schedule, including ongoing filming and work obligations. The decision, though difficult, was one he felt had to be made to prioritize his well-being.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Yan An reassures fans</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the seriousness of his condition, Yan An made sure to ease fans&#39; worries during the livestream. He emphasized that the tumor was non-cancerous and treatable, and that the surgery, although necessary, was not life-threatening.</p>

Members set ONE non-negotiable condition amid August 14 mediation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/1157184507_njz.webp"></img><p style="text-align:justify">The tense legal battle between NewJeans (NJZ) and their agency ADOR entered a critical new phase on July 24, 2025. Both parties attended the third hearing at the Seoul Central District Court. The hearing focused on the core issue: whether the group&rsquo;s exclusive contracts with ADOR remain valid.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Following the session, the court officially scheduled a closed-door mediation for August 14. This signals a potential opportunity for both sides to reach a compromise outside of lengthy litigation. The outcome of the mediation may determine whether <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/i-dles-juniors-named-xogeans-cube-ents-trademark-on-word-sparks-allegations-of-copying-exo-and-newjeans-1393988">NewJeans </a>remains under <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-deepfake-case-ador-intensifies-legal-action-against-defamers-amid-ongoing-contract-validity-suit-1392665">ADOR </a>or is freed from their current contract.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans open to returning to ADOR, but only under one condition</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In a notable shift, NewJeans&rsquo;s legal team clarified that the members aren&rsquo;t completely against returning to ADOR. However, they laid out a non-negotiable condition. The agency must revert to how it was before HYBE&rsquo;s internal audit of former CEO<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/min-hee-jin-cleared-of-criminal-charges-in-hybe-dispute-police-find-no-evidence-of-wrongdoing-by-former-ador-ceo-1393728"> Min Hee Jin </a>began in April 2024.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">NewJeans&rsquo; side stated, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that [the members] absolutely refuse to return to ADOR. If ADOR can be returned to how it was before the audit in April 2024, [they] would be willing to go back. But if that&rsquo;s not possible, then we hope they will let [the members] go by terminating the contract.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The team argued that the core of the dispute stemmed not from a desire to leave ADOR, but from the disruption caused by HYBE&rsquo;s intervention. The audit accused Min Hee Jin of attempting to seize control and manipulate NewJeans&rsquo; management. But it was later found baseless by police. Despite this, the fallout deeply impacted the members.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">According to NewJeans&rsquo;s side, HYBE&rsquo;s attempt to dismiss Min Hee Jin based on the audit created an unstable environment. They claim NewJeans were caught in the crossfire, leading to broken trust and emotional distress. The group&rsquo;s stance is clear: they are only open to staying if ADOR is restored to its pre-audit leadership and structure.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans rejects HYBE-controlled ADOR</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The group&rsquo;s legal representatives also criticized ADOR&rsquo;s current operations, stating that the label has changed drastically since Min Hee Jin&rsquo;s authority was challenged. They accused HYBE of placing its staff in key roles at ADOR, altering the agency&rsquo;s internal culture and direction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">NewJeans&rsquo;s team emphasized that the members&rsquo; success was made possible under Min Hee Jin&rsquo;s leadership. With that foundation now compromised, the team firmly stated that returning to a HYBE-controlled ADOR is not an option.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">They added, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s ADOR is not the same ADOR that led to our past success. It&rsquo;s now controlled by HYBE staff. The so-called generous support and dividends came when Min Hee Jin was CEO. We can&rsquo;t trust ADOR anymore, which is why we can&rsquo;t return to it in its current state.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The upcoming August 14 mediation will be a crucial test of whether both ADOR and NewJeans are willing to find middle ground. If mediation fails, the court will proceed with its final judgment on the contract validity lawsuit. The outcome could potentially set a major precedent for artist-agency relations in K-pop.</p>

The group also hoarded tickets for BLACKPINK&#39;s upcoming concert, selling them at eye-watering markups.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">According to reports from Taiwanese outlets on July 23, Taiwan&#39;s Criminal Police Department confirmed the arrest of four individuals. Among them was a man identified as Mr. Liu. The arrests are linked to the illegal resale of tickets for&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0; padding:0; text-align:left"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jimin-jin-lead-july-2025-boy-group-member-rankings-with-g-dragon-cha-eun-woo-close-behind-check-out-top-30-1394107" target="_blank">G-Dragon</a>&#39;s</span>&nbsp;concerts held at the Taipei Arena from July 11 to 13.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2,500 G-Dragon and BLACKPINK tickets seized</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Following a tip-off, authorities raided the group&#39;s base of operations on July 15, discovering massive quantities of illicit materials. These included over 2,500 exchange codes and printed tickets for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/trying-to-imitate-g-dragon-bts-j-hopes-fans-defend-him-after-recent-appearance-rubbish-rumors-that-he-stole-his-style-1392184">G-Dragon</a> and BLACKPINK concerts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Authorities also found 5.4 million TWD (approximately KRW 7.7 million or 164,000 USD) in cash. Officials also confiscated 500 tickets for&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0; padding:0; text-align:left"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-becomes-first-girl-group-to-surpass-15-billion-spotify-streams-fans-say-their-global-domination-is-unmatched-1394335" target="_blank">BLACKPINK</a>&#39;s</span>&nbsp;Kaohsiung concert scheduled for October. It suggests the ring had already set its sights on future high-profile events.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Scalping syndicate used bots, fake IDs to resell G-Dragon tickets at 10x prices</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Investigations revealed the scalping operation went far beyond simple resales. Mr. Liu is reportedly in his 40s. He allegedly collaborated with a Hong Kong-based engineer who utilized a ticketing bot and ID generator to flood online platforms and facilitate bulk purchases. Each ticket cost Liu a commission of 2,000&ndash;3,000 TWD (approx. 90,000&ndash;140,000 KRW), in addition to the face value.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">These tickets were then resold at inflated prices. Entry passes originally worth 800 TWD (around 30,000 KRW) were listed for 9,800 TWD (460,000 KRW). Meanwhile, VIP tickets costing 8,980 TWD ( 420,000 KRW) were flipped for as much as 55,000 TWD (2.58 million KRW).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Liu&#39;s team even created fake identification documents to bypass Taiwan&#39;s real-name ticketing policy. They station collaborators in hotels near the venues to facilitate transactions and verification on-site.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>BLACKPINK 2023 ticket scandal traced to same group</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Authorities believe the same group may be linked to a separate scandal that erupted in March 2023. At the time, BLACKPINK&#39;s tour tickets, originally priced at 410,000 KRW, were found being scalped for up to 18.78 million KRW, nearly 45 times the original cost.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This case reignites concerns over unchecked ticket scalping in Asia&#39;s live entertainment industry. The issue is especially alarming as K-pop concerts continue to see skyrocketing demand.</p>

Netflix responds to plagiarism allegations]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/462587254_culinary-class-wars.webp"></img><p>Culinary Class Wars has been the talk of the culinary world ever since its release in September 2024. The show subsequently went viral in its home country, South Korea, and sparked renewed global interest in Korean cooking methods and food. The chefs who appeared on the show have been hailed for their presence and techniques, but a Chinese version, seemingly heavily inspired by the original, has invited doubts. Amid questions of Netflix selling the official license to their famed Korean cooking show, the OTT giant has responded to reports, denying any sales on its end.</p>

<p><strong>Culinary Class Wars goes global? Know about the Chinese &lsquo;copy&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p>Known as Yi Fan Feng Shen (Chef of China), the Chinese program premiered on July 17. Run by Tencent Video, the media mogul, it has already invited scrutiny from global viewers over its similarities to the Korean reality show. Said to be a battle involving the Chinese cuisine, it has been heavily cirticized for the undeniable overlaps between the two programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fight between the black-apron and white-apron chefs, a battle-like set-up, and overall vibe match to quite a serious level, according to Chinese viewers who have called out the blatant copy. Amid the concerns, a representative of Netflix has shared with Ilgan Sports that the platform has not officially sold any remake rights for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/culinary-class-wars-review-korean-cooking-show-ate-and-left-no-crumbs-with-competitive-and-invigorating-style-1352855">Culinary Class Wars</a> to China and added that they are currently discussing how to respond to the similarities seen in the show. An intellectual property tussle and court case over legal implications may soon follow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the inaugural season was led by Paik Jong Won (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jo-bo-ahs-dreamy-wedding-pics-win-internet-kim-soo-hyun-chae-shi-ra-baek-jong-won-and-more-attend-ceremony-1353296">Baek Jong Won</a>) and Anh Sung Jae, as they judged 100 contestants from known and unknown backgrounds,&nbsp;who competed for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/napoli-matfia-crowned-as-ultimate-winner-of-culinary-class-wars-apologizes-for-arrogant-jabs-towards-edward-lee-1352799">prize money of 300 million KRW</a>. 20 veterans and 80 newbies fought it out over 12 episodes. A second season was confirmed in October 2024 and is expected to air later this year.</p>

He stole items from the property and later posted photos of the interior online. The ruling has sparked public conversation about fan boundaries, celebrity safety, and the legal consequences of such acts.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">On July 23, the 9th Criminal Division of the Seoul Western District Court, presided over by Judge Kim Min Jung, delivered its verdict in the case. The defendant, referred to as Mr. Kim, was ordered to pay a fine of 10 million KRW.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Kim faced charges of trespassing and theft, to which he admitted during the trial proceedings. Prosecutors had initially requested a 10-month prison sentence. However, the court handed down a financial penalty instead, citing the specific circumstances of the case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans former dorm targeted in 2024 break-in</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">According to court records, Mr. Kim illegally entered the residence located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. It was earlier occupied by the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/i-dles-juniors-named-xogeans-cube-ents-trademark-on-word-sparks-allegations-of-copying-exo-and-newjeans-1393988">NewJeans </a>members. During his break-in, which occurred in December 2024, he stole miscellaneous items, including hangers and placards.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">He even took photographs of the interior of the home. He later uploaded these photos to an online community, drawing attention from netizens. The court emphasized that Mr. Kim&rsquo;s actions were not accidental. &ldquo;He repeatedly broke into the residence and stole items,&rdquo; the court noted. &ldquo;He also took photos of the interior without consent and posted them on the Internet.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>NewJeans had vacated residence a month before break-in</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">However, the court also took into account the context in which the crime occurred. The residence had not been occupied by the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/danielle-remains-unbothered-by-newjeans-drama-joins-good-boys-park-bo-gum-and-sean-for-jog-sesh-amid-ador-feud-1392646">NewJeans </a>members for about a month at the time of the incident. In November 2024, the group had notified their agency, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-is-returning-to-ador-group-skips-re-appeal-in-court-ruling-banning-independent-activities-1392189">ADOR</a>, of their intent to terminate their exclusive contracts. The girls subsequently moved out of the shared living space.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Judge Kim explained that, &ldquo;Since the residence was no longer occupied by the celebrity at the time of the break-in, there was little concern that it would directly lead to an invasion of privacy, and the damage was minor.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. Kim is indicted without detention, and no further legal action is expected unless additional evidence surfaces. The case has sparked online discussion, particularly among NewJeans fans. They argue that celebrity-related break-ins, regardless of timing, should be dealt with more severely.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The film is set against the backdrop of South Korea&rsquo;s glittering and high-pressure entertainment world. The latest version of the script has been written by Eileen Shim. It builds on earlier drafts contributed by prominent writers, including Adele Lim, the screenwriter behind <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/henry-golding-confirms-crazy-rich-asians-2-is-in-works-things-are-in-motion-it-is-happening-1384904">Crazy Rich Asians</a> and Joy Ride.</p>

Having formed a strong bond on set, they welcomed the latter&rsquo;s other friends Choi Woo Shik and Peakboy to form <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/wooga-squads-choi-woo-shik-park-seo-joon-and-park-hyung-siks-friendship-goes-from-real-to-reel-what-we-know-about-joint-project-1373266">Wooga Squad</a>. Now, a clip has resurfaced about the Strong Girl Bong Soon actor talking about the members&rsquo; roles in the team, with doubts being raised about him calling the singer &lsquo;immature maknae&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>What did Park Hyung Sik say about BTS&rsquo; V that angered fans?</strong></p>

<p>A new video has been making the rounds on the internet about the Happiness actor talking about the titles each one of them takes in the group. Spoken in an interview in 2024 as a part of his solo fan meeting promotions, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/buried-hearts-park-hyung-sik-recalls-facing-bullying-and-bring-singled-out-as-trainee-got-used-to-1380679">Park Hyung Sik</a> said, &ldquo;Comparing it as a family relationship, Seojoon hyung is like the father figure, Peakboy hyung is like the eldest son, Wooshik hyung is the second older brother, the playful one, and V is the immature maknae. I feel like I play the role of the mother. It&#39;s not that I want to be, but I often find myself taking care of them and helping them. I think it&#39;s because we always encourage each other, always support one another wholeheartedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The usage of &lsquo;immature youngest one&rsquo; has been taken out of context to define the relationship between the actor and the younger singer. Although the words were indeed used, their implication was not what is being spread around. Park Hyung Sik is known to be very caring of the juniors around him, and as someone who has debuted later in the K-pop and K-drama industries, compared to the actor,&nbsp;V has always looked up to the star.</p>

<p>The Buried Hearts actor has time and again praised BTS&rsquo; music, sharing his love for Kim Taehyung&rsquo;s solo tracks, including Rainy Days. They continue to be as close as ever!</p>

The same was observed at the VIP premiere of the film on July 21, ahead of its theatrical release a few days later.</p>

<p><strong>Jisoo skips solo project promotions for BLACKPINK: Know what it&#39;s about</strong></p>

<p>BLACKPINK&#39;s Jisoo has been missing from the promotions of the film, which began earlier this month; instead, she is currently touring alongside Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa. After sold-out shows in Goyang, the quartet has flown to the US for performances in Los Angeles and Chicago.

<p style="text-align:justify">The Recruit: The Movie is based on the popular South Korean drama series The Recruit. The show was first aired in 2022 and quickly developed a loyal viewership. Known for its unique blend of realism and comedy, the original show depicted the trials, friendship, and absurdities of life in the South Korean military. Following the success of its third season earlier this year, the franchise is now expanding into film.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While the original series focused on the training camp and day-to-day life within a military unit, the upcoming movie will take a different approach. It will shift its setting to a military hospital, offering a fresh perspective on service life through the lens of medical staff. The screenplay is currently in the final stages of development. Filming is expected to begin before the end of 2025.</p>

According to insiders, the idol is already preparing for the role. She&rsquo;s adjusting her commitments to fully immerse herself in her acting career.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This transition reflects her dedication to growth and her desire to explore new creative avenues. Her upcoming film debut is highly anticipated by ONCEs (TWICE&rsquo;s fandom).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>TWICE soars with THIS IS FOR and world tour</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Since debuting with TWICE in 2015 under JYP Entertainment, Jeongyeon has contributed to the group&rsquo;s success with her powerful vocals and versatile stage presence. TWICE has gone on to release multiple chart-topping tracks, including CHEER UP, TT, FANCY, and Dance The Night Away. The band has cemented its place as one of K-pop&rsquo;s leading girl groups.</p>

On July 22, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency&#39;s Cyber Investigation Unit confirmed that three individuals have been referred to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors&#39; Office.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Among them is a foreign airline employee, identified as Mr. A. They face charges for breaching the Information and Communications Network Act, as well as other laws related to unauthorized access and data misuse.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Airline staff leaked K-pop stars&#39; flight info for profit</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Authorities allege that Mr. A, using his insider position at a foreign airline, unlawfully accessed confidential travel details of A-list celebrities. They include globally recognized K-pop acts. He reportedly passed the sensitive information to brokers instead of safeguarding it. In return, he received large sums of money, totaling tens of millions of KRW.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">These brokers then created a network of illegal distribution. They spread the data via encrypted messaging apps, open group chats, and even through social media direct messages. The information was primarily sold to obsessive fans, often referred to as &quot;sasaengs.&quot; These individuals seek out extreme and invasive methods to get close to their favorite stars.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>The dangers of leaked flight data</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The unauthorized release of celebrity flight details has long been a disturbing issue in the K-pop industry. Once this information was leaked, sasaeng fans have been known to book seats on the same flights. They try to interact with idols mid-air, or crowd airport terminals to stalk them upon arrival.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In more severe cases, fans have tampered with in-flight services by altering idols&#39; meal preferences, switching their assigned seats, or even cancelling their bookings entirely. These actions not only disrupt artists&#39; tightly managed schedules but also compromise the safety and comfort of everyone on board.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>HYBE cracks down on BTS flight leaks with task force</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Recognizing the growing severity of the problem,&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0; padding:0; text-align:left"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-and-jungkook-fail-to-reach-settlement-with-sojang-in-90m-krw-defamation-case-trial-procedure-to-continue-1394187" target="_blank">BTS&#39;</a></span>&nbsp;agency,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/min-hee-jin-allegedly-slams-hybe-on-social-media-after-clearance-of-criminal-charges-fans-say-truth-will-always-win-1393789">HYBE,&nbsp;</a>took decisive action in 2023 by launching a dedicated internal task force. The team&#39;s goal was to identify the root cause of these leaks and hold those responsible accountable.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/enhypens-latin-song-debut-soon-photo-with-hybe-labelmate-daddy-yankee-sparks-collaboration-rumors-1393742" target="_blank">HYBE&#39;</a>s&nbsp;investigation led them to identify several social media accounts actively engaged in the sale and promotion of leaked flight details. They compiled digital evidence, including financial transaction logs, chat histories, and user ID data. This information was then submitted directly to the law enforcement authorities. Their cooperation played a crucial role in accelerating the investigation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>How the authorities traced the leak</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Thanks to the detailed information provided by HYBE, investigators were able to trace the source of the leak back to Mr. A. Surveillance of his digital activity and financial records revealed how the illicit operation was carried out. The police identified the roles of each co-conspirator and how the profits were split. They also uncovered which platforms were used to disseminate the information.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Mr. A was arrested in February of this year, followed by two other individuals in March. All three have now been formally referred for prosecution. It&#39;s a major step toward legal accountability in the ongoing fight against celebrity privacy breaches.</p>

A blockbuster project is made! Aiming to achieve that and much more, the best-selling web novel&rsquo;s film adaptation, Omniscient Reader: The Prophet, is set to hit the theatres soon. Talking about the technicalities of his tough role, the actor opened up to The Korea Herald about how most of the time he did not know what his character was up to.</p>

<p><strong>What is Lee Min Ho&rsquo;s part in Omniscient Reader: The Prophet?</strong></p>

<p>Lee Min Ho plays Yoo Joong Hyuk, the protagonist in the serialized web novel, which ends up taking over reality. As a mostly fictional character, he plays a lone battle originally, fighting to the end and is pushed to his limits with every round of the apocalypse. His initial encounter with Ahn Hyo Seop&rsquo;s Kim Dok Ja is very unfriendly as the two fight it out to take charge of the narrative. The actor echoed the emotions, saying, &quot;I&rsquo;ll be honest, it was lonely and desolate,&rdquo; talking about taking up the role surrounded by CGI.</p>

<p>While the story itself was public information, with the popularity of the web novel, Lee Min Ho has his work cut out for him. However, it was not as easy as it sounds. The actor had to maneuver many unknown aspects of his character, which he did not know would befriend or be related in any way to BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jisoo&rsquo;s Lee Ji Hye. The visual pairing, a complete crowd puller, Lee Min Ho, spoke of not being aware of how the role fit in with him. &ldquo;I honestly had no idea how we were even connected,&rdquo; he added about how he no longer knew about the relationships between the many bits in the film.</p>

Exploring storylines]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/2071063576_a-moment-to-remember-saiyaara.webp"></img><p>Setting up the game for one of the biggest openings for a Hindi film in 2025, Saiyaara is eyeing unprecedented box office&nbsp;success. A Mohit Suri directorial, it marks Ahaan Panday&rsquo;s Bollywood debut and the big break that Aneet Padda was looking for after her work in Big Girls Don&rsquo;t Cry and Salaam Venky. With praise comes criticism, and the same has been true for the Bollywood film, which has welcomed the odd few bad remarks. But the biggest controversy has been its comparisons with the 2004 Korean release, A Moment to Remember.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Moment to Remember, starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/son-ye-jin-jo-yuri-confirmed-to-lead-new-show-variety-know-k-pop-industry-based-plot-character-details-and-more-1394154">Son Ye Jin</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jung-woo-sung-confirms-breakup-with-girlfriend-denies-double-dating-allegations-with-moon-gabi-1362809">Jung Woo Sung</a> in the lead roles, became the actress&rsquo;s commercial breakout. It followed the lives of Kim Su Jin and Choi Chul Soo, who end up falling in love after a long courting period.&nbsp;She, a fashion designer and he, an architect, build a beautiful married life. Eventually, her Alzheimer&#39;s disease wades a difference in their marriage, but they decide to stay together.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/saiyaara-review-mohit-suri-gifts-ahaan-panday-and-aneet-padda-a-dream-debut-in-his-intense-love-story-1394012">Saiyaara</a>, led by Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda, follows the lives of Krish Kapoor and Vaani Batra, a struggling musician and a journalist-cum-poet who meet amid a troubled time in her life. They fall in love and carve a successful path for him to walk on as a singer. With a superhit track on his hands, he learns of her Alzheimer&#39;s disease after encountering some troublesome moments involving her ex-boyfriend. After a long-winded road to each other, the two get married in an emotional and romantic culmination of their love story.</p>

<p><strong>Similarities in A Moment to Remember and Saiyaara</strong></p>

<p>Netizens have shared a barrage of moments that can draw comparisons between the two projects, but the central plot&nbsp;being about the onset of early Alzheimer&#39;s disease in both the female leads has become the point of debate for many. Their problematic pasts with ex-lovers in the film have also been disputed, as well as their relationship with their own families. A recreation of one of their most romantic moments from their dating era has been added to the bunch time and again. That is where the line has to be drawn, however, both films take on different paths and messages towards the end.</p>

<p><strong>Differences in A Moment to Remember and Saiyaara</strong></p>

<p>Spread over three &lsquo;acts&rsquo;, Son Ye Jin and Jung Woo Sung get married towards the start of the film. With no courting on the girl&rsquo;s end, Ahaan Panday and Aneet Padda&rsquo;s movie benefits him more than her, with the use of her writing for his fame as a musician. They get married at the end, finally earning a sigh of relief from the viewers. The confusion has stayed constant in both depictions, but that seems to be an obvious effect of the concerned illness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, Son Ye Jin runs off to a care facility while Aneet Padda lives her life in Himachal Pradesh, not wanting to be discovered. Mohit Suri does a larger-than-life portrayal of their love story, unlike the homely touch of A Moment to Remember. Overall, despite many similarities with its Korean counterpart, there does not seem to be plagiarism involved in the newer Hindi film.</p>

According to a July 21 report by the K-media outlet Star Today, the two parties appeared in court to reach a settlement through discussion; however, it hit a roadblock. It indicates that the case, which began in February 2024, is far from over, and the trials will continue.</p>

<h2>BTS&#39; V and Jungkook&#39;s mediation with defamer Sojang yielded no result</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/are-bts-vs-opportunities-being-blocked-by-hybe-fans-slam-staffs-unprofessional-action-during-paris-visit-1394122">V</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkooks-new-solo-music-and-world-tour-soon-new-post-and-profile-pic-hint-at-possibility-1394059">Jungkook</a>&#39;s sides participated in a court-mediated discussion on July 21 at 9:40 am KST (6:10 am IST) at the Seoul Western District Court. It aimed at exploring a potential settlement in their defamation lawsuit against <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ives-jang-wonyoung-defamation-case-sojang-fights-back-appeals-50-million-krw-penalty-order-1391891">Sojang</a>, the operator of the YouTube channel Taldeok Camp. This development follows the second-level court&#39;s decision to redirect the case to this format from a full hearing, which was made on June 16.</p>

<p>The discussion was intended to allow the prosecution and the defendant to engage in discussions and reach a mutually beneficial outcome with the court&#39;s assistance. However, despite their efforts, the two parties were unable to come to an agreement. As a result, the court declared &quot;mediation failed&quot;, and consequently, the existing trial procedure will resume.</p>

<h2>The origin of V and Jungkook&#39;s defamation case</h2>

<p>In February 2025, the court ruled against YouTuber Sojang, determining she spread false information about the BTS duo. She achieved this by posting 23 videos on her channel over a period of 1 year and 8 months, from October 2021 to June 2023. The 12th Civil Division of the Seoul Western District Court subsequently ordered her to pay damages totaling 76 million KRW (approximately 53,000 USD).</p>

<p>Initially, V and Jungkook filed a lawsuit in January 2025, seeking 90 million KRW in damages for defamation and unauthorized use of content. Although the court ruled in their favor, the damages amount was adjusted to 76 million KRW.&nbsp;It was done with the understanding that she was a first-time offender and genuinely remorseful for her actions.</p>

<p>Besides the suit against the BTS members,&nbsp;Sojang also lost some other&nbsp;defamation cases, including those involving IVE&#39;s Jang Wonyoung and former Wanna One member Kang Daniel.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Omniscient Reader: The Prophecy is adapted from the best-selling Korean web novel. It follows the story of Kim Dok Ja, an ordinary office worker. He suddenly finds himself living inside the pages of a fantasy novel he was reading. With knowledge of the story&rsquo;s events and its central hero, Yoo Joong Hyuk, Dok Ja must navigate a collapsing world and attempt to change its destined ending.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Lee Min Ho plays the novel&rsquo;s original protagonist, Yoo Joong Hyuk. He&rsquo;s a stoic and powerful warrior, while Ahn Hyo Seop brings Kim Dok Ja to life on the big screen. Moreover, the movie is set to premiere in theaters on July 23. Whether the full film can turn opinions around or whether this scene is a preview of larger issues remains to be seen.</p>

He explained that his way of relating to people, including women, tends to differ from the norm.

<p style="text-align:justify">Lee explained, &ldquo;Up until now, I think I&rsquo;ve lived my life not thinking much of the small happiness, the happiness that comes from the small moments of everyday life.&rdquo; Lee further added, &ldquo;So I think I&#39;d rather be someone who lives by looking at small things. I feel like I have to find someone who can think about &lsquo;what we&rsquo;re moving forward for&rsquo; together with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Lee Min Ho shared that he envisions his ideal partner as someone with a personality quite unlike his own. He added that their profession doesn&#39;t matter to him, whether they&#39;re in the same industry or not isn&rsquo;t a deciding factor.</p>

All about upcoming reassessment]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/1233150565_r.webp"></img><p style="text-align:justify">Plans for SF9&rsquo;s Rowoon&rsquo;s military enlistment have unexpectedly changed. He will no longer be enlisting in the South Korean military on July 21, 2025 as originally scheduled. On July 17, his agency FNC Entertainment officially announced that the idol-turned-actor&#39;s enlistment has been temporarily delayed. The decision came after the results of a recent pre-enlistment physical examination.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/extraordinary-you-star-rowoon-to-enlist-in-military-in-july-ahead-of-the-murky-stream-release-know-estimated-discharge-date-1389611">Rowoon </a>had been preparing to join as an active-duty soldier. But the standard pre-enlistment check, conducted under the guidelines of the Military Manpower Administration (MMA), raised concerns that require further medical review. As a result, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jung-hae-in-and-rowoon-confirmed-for-special-cameos-in-spring-of-youth-starring-ha-yoo-joon-and-park-ji-hoo-report-1383582">Rowoon </a>received a Grade 7 classification. It is a designation that mandates a re-examination.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rowoon receives Grade 7 in pre-enlistment exam</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">According to FNC, the MMA began conducting pre-enlistment physical examinations two weeks ahead of each scheduled enlistment starting this month. During <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/academy-awards-2025-blackpinks-lisa-stuns-in-floor-length-tuxedo-rowoon-shimmers-in-black-suit-1375405">Rowoon</a>&rsquo;s check-up, he was issued a Grade 7 result. It signifies uncertainty regarding his medical eligibility and defers enlistment until further assessment.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The agency explained that due to the result, Rowoon&rsquo;s enlistment has been postponed. He has already filed an appeal and will undergo a reassessment in early August.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rowoon&rsquo;s commitment to serve remains firm</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the delay, Rowoon has expressed a clear intention to fulfill his national duty. FNC added, &ldquo;He hopes to confirm that there are no issues with fulfilling his mandatory service and to enlist as an active-duty soldier as soon as possible,&rdquo; as quoted by Soompi.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The agency clarified that the reason for the re-examination involves private medical information. FNC added, &ldquo;We are unable to disclose the details.&rdquo; They asked for the public&rsquo;s understanding.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Fans praise Rowoon&rsquo;s responsible approach</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">FNC concluded its statement by assuring fans that they will provide further updates once Rowoon&#39;s new enlistment schedule is confirmed. As news broke about the postponement, social media platforms gets flooded with heartfelt messages from fans across the globe.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">They express concern for Rowoon&rsquo;s health but applaud his transparent and responsible handling of the situation. Many also praised his resolve to serve despite the unexpected complications. They emphasise that his well-being should come first.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Supporters now await news on whether he will be cleared to proceed with active-duty enlistment in the near future. Many hope to see him enlist safely and successfully when the time is right.</p>
