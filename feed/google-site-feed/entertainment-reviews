<p>Pratik Gandhi and Divyenndu deliver&nbsp;reliable and engaging portrayals of a firefighter and a policeman respectively. Pratik Gandhi brings a quiet intensity to his role as Vithal. Divyenndu&#39;s portrayal of a corrupt but conflicted cop adds an interesting layer to the film.</p>

<p>Sai Tamhankar and Saiyami Kher, though in supporting roles, hold their own with their high-on-impact&nbsp;performances. Jitendra Joshi stands out as Mahadev, Vithal&rsquo;s close friend. His performance evolves from a secondary character to one of the movie&rsquo;s more significant figures. Kabir Shah as Vithal&rsquo;s son Amar does a reasonably good&nbsp;job and same goes for all the other actors in the movie.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Agni</strong></h3>

<p>Agni is a very credible and worthy watch that pays tribute to the bravery and sacrifices of firefighters, who often go unrecognized for their contributions. The film succeeds in highlighting the emotional and physical toll of their work, especially through the dynamic between Vithal and Samit. However, its&nbsp;slow&nbsp;pacing and documentary-style presentation&nbsp;doesn&#39;t allow it to be&nbsp;as thrilling and impactful as it could have been. Despite these few personal issues, Agni is a film that deserves appreciation for its intent and execution. It serves as both an informative and emotional tribute to our fire fighters.</p>

<p>You can watch Agni, now playing on Prime Video. Have you watched Agni yet? If yes, how did you find it to be? Do let us know</p>

<p>Allu Arjun continues to shine as Pushpa. His performance is a masterclass in action and comedy. He owns every frame with his energy and screen presence, and his portrayal of Pushpa&rsquo;s raw aggression mixed with charm works wonders. However, there is a slight issue with his dialect, as some of his lines are hard to understand.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/fahadh-faasil-to-romance-triptii-dimri-in-his-bollywood-debut-with-filmmaker-imtiaz-ali-1361162">Fahadh Faasil</a>, despite being a brilliant actor, struggles to make a major impact as Inspector Shekhawat. The character lacks the depth needed to be truly memorable, and this weakens Faasil&rsquo;s potential in the role.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/is-allu-arjun-and-rashmika-mandannas-pushpa-2-facing-major-roadblock-for-this-reason-know-the-issue-here-1361128">Rashmika Mandanna</a>, as Srivalli, is refreshing and brings a much-needed balance to the film&rsquo;s otherwise intense atmosphere. Her electrifying chemistry with Allu Arjun is a highlight. The supporting cast delivers competent performances. They fulfill their parts but don&#39;t stand out.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h3>

<p>Pushpa 2: The Rule is a quintessential mass entertainer that will surely satisfy fans of the franchise. It delivers on the action, drama, and charisma that made the first part so much loved. Yes,&nbsp;the film struggles with pacing, convenience in its screenplay, and the lack of strong antagonists to keep the narrative thrilling. But, its commercial appeal, and excellent action set pieces ensure that Pushpa 2 remains a must-watch for mass cinema lovers in packed theatres.</p>

<p>You can watch Pushpa 2: The Rule in theatres now.</p>

<p>The plot was successful while showcasing genuine and emotionally charged family relationships. It was also a success in making the viewers giggle and chuckle. The creators have utilized every moment they could to bring in those laughs from the audience. Not to mention the cuteness, may that be the pig or Moana&rsquo;s sister Simea.</p>

<p>Moana 2 is worth watching, especially on the big screen to truly delve into the various emotions the story of the sequel had to offer.</p>

<p>Abhishek Bachchan gives one of the best performances of his career. Even though the character goes through a lot of physical and mental transformation, you never feel the actor skips a beat. He has done well with the dialect too and makes his portrayal convincing.</p>

<p>Ahilya Bamroo, Johny Lever, and Kripalani lend able support and shine in their own moments.</p>

<p>Shoojit Sircar and writer Ritesh Shah have done well but could&#39;ve taken a slightly more audience-appealing route considering the film is a theatrical release. The kind of treatment I Want To Talk has got would&#39;ve been a right fit for an OTT exclusive release.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of I Want To Talk</strong></h3>

<p>I Want To Talk is a kind of cinema that will appeal to a tiny chunk of the audience. The story had a lot more potential that remains untapped, and it hurts, like Abhishek Bachchan tells his doctor friend in the end.</p>

<h3><strong>Rating: 2.5 stars</strong></h3>

<p>Director Jon M. Chu brings the celebrated musical to life with stunning visuals and a powerful 11-song soundtrack. With its compelling narrative, striking theme, and nuanced performances (Grande and Erivo are earning Oscar buzz for a reason), Wicked: Part One is a cinematic experience worth witnessing in theaters near you. </p>

<p>Jessica Barden&nbsp;as Young Valya Harkonnen has a small but impactful role. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/dune-prophecy-hbo-shares-first-official-look-of-emily-watson-as-valya-harkonnen-1327757">Emily Watson</a>&nbsp;as Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen delivers a very credible performance.&nbsp;Olivia Williams&nbsp;as Sister Tula Harkonnen lends good support.&nbsp;Travis Fimmel&nbsp;as Desmond Hart is the one to really watch out for in the episodes to follow.&nbsp;Mark Strong&nbsp;as Emperor Javicco Corrino performs on expected lines. Other actors part of the show do well in their limited scenes.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict Of&nbsp;Dune: Prophecy - Season 1 Episode 1</strong></h3>

<p>Dune: Prophecy Season 1 Episode 1 showcases impressive visuals and solid performances, but it doesn&rsquo;t immediately grab the viewer in the way the Dune movies do. The episodes to follow need to really be more engaging and immersive, given the kind of expectations people have due to the Dune films.</p>

<p>Vikrant Massey as Samar Kumar holds the film on his able soldiers. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/the-sabarmati-report-final-advance-bookings-vikrant-massey-raashii-khanna-and-ridhi-dogra-starrer-sells-just-3250-tickets-in-top-chains-for-opening-day-1358369">Ridhi Dogra </a>as Manika Rajpurohit has a great aura around her and she delivers a confident performance. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-vikrant-massey-and-raashii-khanna-to-star-in-a-romantic-love-story-deets-inside-1242428">Raashi Khanna</a> as Amrita Gill is a breath of fresh air and lights up the screen. All other supporting actors in the movie do a fairly good job.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of The Sabarmati Report:</strong></h3>

<p>The Sabarmati Report is a film that has its political inclinations and intentions clear. However, what really works is its engaging fictional drama created around the real life Godhra Train Burning Incident.</p>

<p>The Sabarmati Report plays in theatres now. You can book your tickets for the movie.</p>

<p>Paul Mescal as Lucius, lives his character. He is beyond amazing. Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius delivers an understated performance and completely wins you over. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/denzel-washington-says-his-gay-kiss-was-cut-from-gladiator-ii-i-guess-they-werent-ready-for-that-yet-1358267">Denzel Washington</a> is brilliance personified. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla is beautifully expressive. Fred Hechinger and Joseph Quinn do well and so do all the other actors part of the movie.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Gladiator II</strong></h3>

<p>Gladiator II is an experience. It is films like Gladiator II which make you feel why you fell in love with movies in the first place. It is a very fitting sequel to the cult that Gladiator is.</p>

<p>Sidhant Gupta as Pandit Jawaharal Nehru delivers a subdued but effective performance. Rajendra Chawla as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is absolutely fun to watch. Arif Zakaria as Mohammad Ali Jinnah is excellent. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/binny-and-family-twitter-review-tweets-to-read-about-anjini-dhawan-and-pankaj-kapurs-film-before-booking-your-seats-1350750">Rajesh Kumar </a>does what he is best at.

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Freedom At Midnight</strong></h3>

<p>Freedom At Midnight is a very well crafted political-thriller that keeps you hooked onto it from the first scene to the last. It is a show that is a cut above the rest. It certainly warrants a watch, preferably with young adults.</p>

<p>Anupam Kher delivers the performance of a lifetime in Vijay 69. This man acts with more passion with every passing film of his.

<p>Varun Dhawan as Rahi Gambhir is solid. He is in good touch through the course of the 6 episodes. He performs his stunts with great finesse. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/samantha-ruth-prabhus-latest-ethnic-airport-look-proves-minimalistic-style-can-never-go-out-of-fashion-watch-1356668">Samantha Ruth Prabhu </a>as honey is wonderful. She has a lovely screen presence and she performs action stunts like a professional too.&nbsp;Kashvi Majmundar as Nadia is the pick of the actors. She brings the much needed simplicity and softness to the world of Citadel. She is a breath of fresh air and one really waits for the scenes featuring her.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/kay-kay-menon-on-shekhar-home-co-actor-ranvir-shorey-not-getting-acting-opportunities-says-this-1338888">Kay&nbsp;Kay Menon</a>, Sikandar Kher, Simran and Saqib Saleem are ever-so-dependable. Shivankit Singh Parihar and&nbsp;Soham Majumdar as Chacko and Ludo respectively&nbsp;are endearing to watch. Shashank Vyas as Vivek or V Uncle is good too. Other supporting actors of Citadel: Honey Bunny do well with what they get.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Citadel: Honey Bunny</strong></h3>

<p>Citadel: Honey Bunny is a spectacularly shot and choreographed action-espionage series which could do with a much better story and screenplay. If you like sleek-action and one-take shots, there is no reason not to tune into Citadel: Honey Bunny because it has those in plenty.</p>

<p>Kartik Aaryan as Rooh Baba is decent. While the actor lends some extraordinary star value, he doesn&#39;t quite get the best lines and scenes to leave a huge impression. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/vidya-balan-reveals-she-would-love-to-do-the-dirty-picture-2-and-says-its-been-a-while-since-ive-done-1355768">Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit </a>are generally quite natural performers but both of them overdo their parts. As a result, the conflicts start to feel less convincing and more gimmicky. Triptii Dimri doesn&#39;t get much to work with in the film. But she does shine onscreen.</p>

<p>Sanjay Mishra, Vijay Raaz, Rajpal Yadav and other crediible supporting actors contribute the&nbsp;most to&nbsp;the film&#39;s comedic moments. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-anees-bazmee-gives-update-on-bhool-bhulaiyaa-4-it-will-be-a-huge-1353060">Anees Bazmee</a> as a director partly succeeds and partly fails.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 does have a few LOL and ROFL moments for the audience but it ends up being a middling affair because of the convenience of the plot and the inconsistencies in the screenplay.&nbsp;Families can go to watch the film but it is essential not to expect it to be a ripper of a film.</p>

<p>Ajay Devgn has performed well as Bajirao Singham. People may miss his old larger-than-life dialogues but it should be understood that his character has aged over all these years and is more on the calm side. Kareena Kapoor Khan is restricted and doesn&#39;t get to show her acting skills. Deepika Padukone also doesn&#39;t get enough screen space. Tiger Shroff will finally make his fans happy. Ranveer Singh is excellent and Akshay Kumar has his moments. Arjun Kapoor is the biggest surprise.</p>

<p>Rohit Shetty has done a decent job as a director but that&#39;s not what we expect from a filmmaker of his caliber.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Singham Again</strong></h3>

<p>Overall, Singham Again is a decent time pass entertainer this Diwali loaded with a great star cast and cameos which you can enjoy with your family. Don&#39;t go with high expectations and you won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>

<p>Kriti Sanon in her double role of Saumya and Shailee is glamorous. She is able to create a clear distinction between both the characters. Kajol as Inspector VJ is alright. Her accent through the film feels forced, though. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/exclusive-shaheer-sheikh-confirms-being-a-part-of-do-patti-says-its-an-honor-to-work-1247827">Shaheer Sheikh</a> as Dhruv is convincing. He can be charming as well as haunting. He also has a good screen presence. Tanvi Azmi as Maa ji has the weirdest role to play, which makes her performance unconvincing. Other supporting actors in the movie like Brijendra Kala are alright.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Do Patti:</strong></h3>

<p>Do Patti is a tone-deaf film and makers should have been more careful about what they are trying to justify and what message they are trying to put out. The aimlessness and inconsistency of the movie is another issue.<br />
Do Patti, at best can be watched for its charming cast.</p>

<p>Do Patti is now streaming on Netflix.</p>

<p>Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is fun.

The supporting actors like Peggy Lu, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Rhys Ifans among others don&#39;t have much to work with, here. They do their job, modestly.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Venom: The Last Dance</strong></h3>

<p>Venom: The Last Dance is a formulaic superhero film which tries to please its viewers with everything they&#39;ve enjoyed about Venom thus far. It&#39;s a hit and miss this time around.<br />

<p>Among the Bollywood Wives, Neelam Kothari was a lot of fun. Bhavana Pandey added simplicity to the show. Seema Sajdeh showed her vulnerability, beautifully. Maheep Kapoor came off as fake and rash for better part of the season but she too showed her vulnerability when it mattered.<br />
From the Delhi wives, Shalini Passi was the highlight, though it often felt like she was trying to make it all about her. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/fabulous-lives-vs-bollywood-wives-s3-ranbir-kapoor-calls-sister-riddhima-munphat-says-dont-get-taken-by-her-politeness-or-fake-accent-1354145">Riddhima Kapoor</a> and Kalyani Chawla were alright, but there was nothing really striking and exciting about them.</p>

<p>All the Bollywood husbands were endearing, be it Chunky Pandey, Sanjay Kapoor or Samir Soni.<br />
Talking about the guests, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/karan-johar-gives-shoutout-to-pakistani-singer-chahat-fateh-ali-khans-version-of-tauba-tauba-karan-aujlas-reaction-leaves-fans-in-splits-1353682">Karan Johar</a> was fun and raunchy. Orry being Orry, did what he does best. Gauri Khan looked graceful and Saif Ali Khan brought calmness and positivity.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives S3</strong></h3>

<p>Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives S3 has a few heartening moments but it just doesn&#39;t have the spunk, wit&nbsp;and sasse to classify as an enjoyable scripted-reality, guilty-pleasure show.&nbsp;<br />
You can now watch season 3 of Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives (Fabulous Lives vs Bollywood Wives S3) on Netflix now</p>

<p>Alia Bhatt as Satya is dependable. She holds the film as well as she can. She nails it in the emotional sequences towards the end. Vedang Raina as Ankur is very good. He puts his heart and soul into the character. The scene where he is lashed-on by a fellow inmate is emotionally taxing. You feel his pain. Vivek Gomber as the Jailer is menacing. He makes you hate him. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/alia-bhatt-ranbir-kapoor-kamaal-ke-hai-admits-manoj-pahwa-seema-pahwa-recalls-heartwarming-gesture-of-actress-on-gangubai-kathiawadi-sets-1342406">Manoj Pahwa</a> as the father of a prisoner who was falsely implicated by the Hanshi Dao police is all heart.

<p>Rajkummar Rao as Vicky is good and dependable. He has a great comic timing. On the hindsight, you do feel a repetitiveness in his performance. Triptii Dimri as Vidya is well cast. The small town character suits her well. Despite her comedy not always hitting the right notes, one does feel that it is a type of role that is tailor-made for her. Once she gets into her groove, she can make comedy her forte. The ensemble cast consisting of brilliant actors like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-vijay-raaz-ousted-from-ajay-devgns-son-of-sardaar-2-official-statements-from-actor-and-producer-kumar-mangat-1339851">Vijay Raaz</a>, Mallika Sherawat, Tiku Talsania, Archana Puran Singh and Mukesh Tiwari among many others, elevate the film with their comic presence. Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video is infact a love letter to all the comic artists who made our childhood awesome.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video</strong></h3>

<p>Vicky Vidya Ka Woh Wala Video is a fun, lighthearted comedy-drama that falls in the category of a good timepass watch. It gives major nostalgia, especially to those who have grown up watching the comedies of the 90s and 00s, and it transports you to a simpler time.

<p>Ananya Panday does extremely well as the relatable social media influencer Nella; Who is gliding her way through life that hasn&#39;t particularly been easy. Vikramaditya Motwane plays to the actress&#39; strengths and brings out the best in her. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/call-me-baes-vihaan-samat-reveals-what-show-director-said-about-recreating-sidharth-malhotra-kiara-advanis-wedding-scene-with-ananya-panday-1347707">Vihaan Samat</a> as Nella&#39;s boyfriend turned ex, Joe, is ever-so-dependable. The duo bring a lot of freshness onto the table.<br />
Other supporting characters in the movie have little to do, but they do well with whatever little they get.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>CTRL is a neatly packaged thriller-drama that will make you ponder and reflect. While it may not take you by surprise or give you the sort of thrill and high you&#39;d expect from a film of this sort, it has enough merit to be given a watch.<br />

<p>Siddhant Chaturvedi plays his part, quite well. He excels in the action portions but his acting in the dramatic portions could have been more impactful. Malavika Mohanan as Nikhat is good but the story doesn&#39;t give her much to work with. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/kill-fame-raghav-juyal-reveals-vicky-kaushal-being-his-inspiration-bad-newz-actor-says-rulaeyga-kya-1324605">Raghav Juyal</a> as Shafiq is dependable. Ram Kapoor and Gajraj Rao perform on expected lines. Raj Arjun as drug mafia Feroz is the pick of the actors. Other supporting actors do a credible job.</p>

<p>Yudhra has phenomenal action sequences but the dragged and clich&eacute;d story makes the Siddhant Chaturvedi and Malavika Mohanan film an underwhelming fare.</p>

<p>Call Me Bae lacks the spark of a cracking show. It is too lousy,&nbsp;lackluster and uninventive&nbsp;to create an impact. It is a&nbsp;rare show&nbsp;that doesn&#39;t feel like it is trying.

<p>Possibly the biggest drawback in Kottukkaali comes with its writing. While it is true that PS Vinothraj has added several layers to the story, with the use of metaphors, and has cleverly written several portions of the film, the film does fall short towards the end. The film seems to come to an abrupt end, leaving the audience desperately wanting for more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, several scenes within the film have been intentionally repeated and dragged out, where the static frames are held that way for a tad bit too long. That being said, while the negatives in Kottukkaali might irk the audience a bit, they do, in no way, take away the brilliance with which PS Vinothraj has made this social satire.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66c9f88bd09c4"><strong>Performances in Kottukkaali</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kottukkaali-trailer-out-soori-anna-ben-starrer-is-an-intriguing-and-mindbending-drama-grounded-in-a-rural-landscape-1338582">Anna Ben</a>&rsquo;s performance as Meena is definitely one of the best performances by the Kumbalangi Nights actress in her career so far. Although there are minimal dialogues, Meena says a lot with her silences and her actions, the credit for which goes to Anna Ben. It is also important to mention that Kottukkaali marks the actress&rsquo; Tamil debut as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soori&rsquo;s character, Pandi, is undoubtedly the powerhouse in Kottukkaali. Pandi is a gray shaded character who attempts to change, adapt to modernity, but is still held back by the superstitions, customs and norms in which he was raised. His maturity in situations comes out of him suppressing the things he is accustomed to. Soori portrays the character beautifully on screen, bringing him to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The performances by the supporting cast should not go unnoticed as well. The characters together successfully communicate the rustic feel of the film to the audience, bringing the world PS Vinothraj has created to life.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66c9f88bd09c8"><strong>Verdict of Kottukkaali</strong></h2>

<p>Everything said and done, Kottukkaali is a one of a kind experiment in Indian cinema, and an excellent one for that matter. However, the film has an inclination towards arthouse cinema, and might not come off as everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. That being said, if you&rsquo;re willing to catch an experimental and truly beautiful social commentary masquerading as a road-drama film, Kottukkaali is a must-watch in the theaters.</p>

<p>Alien: Romulus is a very fine sci-fi horror that is thrilling and intriguing. It is high on emotions and is very ambitious in terms of vision. It wouldn&#39;t be wrong to say that it is one of the best Alien franchise films to have ever come out.<br />

The movie marks the sequel to the 2019 flick iSmart Shankar.</p>

<p>With Sanjay Dutt playing the main antagonist, the movie features an ensemble cast of actors like Kavya Thapar, Sayaji Shinde, Bani J, Getup Srinu, Ali, Makarand Deshpande, Jhansi, and more playing key roles. If you plan to watch the movie in theaters, here is the Pinkvilla review for you to read.</p>

<h2 id="66be25a04ac33"><strong>The Plot:</strong></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/double-ismart-twitter-review-ram-pothineni-and-puri-jagannadhs-combo-is-a-hit-or-miss-1339274">Double iSmart</a> starts with a dreaded gangster known as Big Bull being diagnosed with a brain tumor, making him fear his end is soon. In hopes of extending his life and becoming immortal, the gangster seeks the help of a scientist who suggests transferring his memory to someone else.</p>

<p>However, despite efforts to create a man with a portable USB port inside his brain, they fail. This leads them to find a person who already has it, Ustaad iSmart Shankar. The rest of the movie focuses on how Big Bull succeeds in his mission and what is set to happen to Shankar.</p>

<h3><strong>The Good:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/meet-actor-who-debuted-at-14-was-booked-for-public-smoking-has-unending-love-for-gadgets-and-boasts-a-net-worth-of-over-100-crores-1337162">Ram Pothineni</a>&rsquo;s Double iSmart largely offers some heroic moments for the actor donning a macho avatar, similar to his recent works. The energy he brings into the screen with his mannerisms is commendable and would be loved by his fans.</p>

<p>The actor is also seamless in his dance moves, which is no surprise. The flexibility he has in pulling off some energy-filled elements is also reflected in his action sequences. Along with that, the chemistry shared by the leading actors is surely fiery but is cluttered with the faulty characters they are playing.</p>

<p>Coming to the technical aspects, the biggest saving grace of the movie is the musical prowess of Mani Sharma, who has put in his true efforts for the film. Be it the dance tracks or the background scores; the musician is the one who truly shined in this nonsense-filled mess of a movie.</p>

<p>Along with the music, it is also commendable to mention cinematographers Gianni Giannelli and Shyam K. Naidu for some visuals of the film, especially in the climax.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bad:</strong></h3>

<p>Double iSmart is truly a profound mess of a movie with dumb tropes and illogical narration. The film, a sequel with the same character from iSmart Shankar, is leading a new life once again as the lowly thug. The screenplay used for the movie fails on multiple occasions, making us question our existence.</p>

<p>From the writing of the characters and events to the execution of scenes, it feels like a complete mess with absurd elements. Right from the start, the movie fails to connect with its conviction on what or why everything is happening.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the problematic portrayal of romance, which is filled with eve-teasing and perverted behaviors, the main protagonist has no character arc and does not even manage to convince us of his emotional turmoils.</p>

<p>Despite having some good chemistry between RamPo and Kavya Thapar, the love angle between them is just purely illogical. However, as they are the leading pair and as per the laws of movies, they fall in love with that too without much hesitation. A love so carried away that you feel threatened watching it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/sanjay-dutt-to-work-with-director-puri-jagannadh-in-7-movies-charmme-kaur-confirms-at-double-ismart-pre-release-event-1337033">Sanjay Dutt</a> is wasted in his character and is given a haphazard everyday goon kind of role and termed a gangster. Despite the actor&rsquo;s efforts in bringing out a menacing antagonist, the actor fails helplessly.</p>

<p>However, the most annoying aspect of all is the outdated use of a separate subplot in the name of humor. Introducing comedian Ali as a tribal person goes on a slapstick ride of comedy errors that have nothing to do with the actual plot. The scenes presented as humor not only feel misogynistic but also stand strong as pure mockery.</p>

<p>The sequel movie even fails to address the essential aspects of the first film, like how Shankar recovered, what happened to the police officer&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend, and whether he has forgotten his own ex-lover. However, none of this is answered, making us conclude that iSmart Shankar was far superior.</p>

<h3><strong>The Performance:</strong></h3>

<p>None of the actors gave any sort of outstanding performance. The only tolerable aspect was seeing Ram Pothineni and Kavya Thapar dance their hearts out.</p>

<h3><strong>The Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>Double iSmart is truly a one-of-a-kind mess of a film, which makes you wonder how a man who created films like Mahesh Babu&rsquo;s Pokiri and Jr NTR&rsquo;s Temper has limited himself to this level.</p>

<p>Some hardcore RamPo fans may enjoy the movie, but that, too, would be a hassle for them. The film can be watched by anyone who wishes to appreciate life more because, as it starts, you only want it to end.</p>

<p>If you are okay with seeing a no-brainer action flick with action and dance, then surely this could be a one-time watch.</p>

The movie directed by Pa Ranjith presents a story set in the British Raj era that focuses on themes of oppression and survival.</p>

<p>The film which has an ensemble cast of actors like Parvathy Thiruvothu, Daniel Caltagirone, Pasupathy, and many more clearly presents a story stemming from strong politics. If you&rsquo;re planning to watch the Vikram starrer in theaters, here is the Pinkvilla review to help you decide.</p>

<h2 id="66bdc51acbf43"><strong>The Plot:</strong></h2>

<p>The film Thangalaan revolves around the life of a tribal community leader, played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/one-of-the-most-hard-working-actors-dhanush-extends-heartfelt-wishes-to-chiyaan-vikram-prior-to-thangalaans-release-1339185">Chiyaan Vikram</a>. In a British-led expedition, the leader and his tribe assist Lord Clement, a British General and colonizer to unearth gold from mines in Kolar.</p>

<p>To preserve his tribe&#39;s legacy and ensure their safety, Thangalaan chooses to ally with his oppressor, who has promised him a portion of gold in exchange for assistance. The remainder of the film delves into an adventurous drama filled with a blend of political intrigue and mythical themes.</p>

<h3 id="66bdc51acbf50"><strong>The Good:</strong></h3>

<p>Considering the strengths of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/thangalaan-twitter-review-11-tweets-you-should-read-before-watching-chiyaan-vikram-starrer-1339253">Thangalaan</a>, it&#39;s clear and safe to see how the film operates, largely due to Chiyaan Vikram&#39;s commitment to the narrative. His natural and engaging ability to portray his characters, showcasing both physical and emotional development, effortlessly draws us into the film&#39;s universe.</p>

<p>While co-actors have also contributed heavily to the film&rsquo;s making and its storytelling, the versatile nature of the Raavanan actor has once again been proven here. As this stands true, director Pa Ranjith has weaved an intricate and stunning world from the backdrops of the mines and immersed in the tribal setting.</p>

<p>By skillfully merging historical and mythical elements, the film has crafted a visually stunning and intricate experience that invites viewers to delve deeper, moving beyond just the surface of the storyline.</p>

<p>When it comes to the technical side of the film, one of Thangalaan&rsquo;s greatest strengths is the musical talent of GV Prakash Kumar. The actor and musician has incorporated folk-inspired background scores that are deeply rooted in Tamil traditions, adding richness to every scene. The emotional depth created by his music elevates the overall viewing experience significantly.</p>

<p>A. Kishor Kumar&#39;s thematic approach in the film&#39;s cinematography deserves commendation for its impressive representation. The breathtaking visuals, which dive deep into the film&#39;s raw storytelling, genuinely capture the essence of what the movie aims to convey.</p>

<h3 id="66bdc51acbf81"><strong>The Bad:</strong></h3>

<p>Thangalaan remains true to its essence and beliefs in many ways, but it does face some challenges along the way. The slow-paced storytelling might not appeal to everyone, and when combined with some uninspired and foreseeable moments, the film occasionally veers off course.</p>

<p>Certain scenes that are predominantly dialogue-driven can present a challenge from a writing perspective, often testing our patience. The difficulty in editing these segments while maintaining the overall structure may have resulted in a somewhat average technical execution.</p>

<p>Additionally, the film suffers from subpar visual effects that detract from the core of the story. This leaves viewers feeling uneasy as they attempt to engage with the&nbsp;work directed by Pa Ranjith.</p>

<h3 id="66bdc51acbf86"><strong>The Performance:</strong></h3>

<p>As previously mentioned, the most formidable acting talent in the film is Chiyaan Vikram. His remarkable capacity to fully engage with the diverse worlds crafted by skilled directors, along with his commitment to the necessary character development, has established him as a true symbol of versatility. The richness of his character portrayals has enabled him to deliver an outstanding performance.</p>

<p>In the same manner, the leading ladies of the film have also managed to stand strong with their characters and fit into the world impressively. As Parvathy Thiruvothu asserts her strength with her skills as always, it was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/malavika-mohanan-reveals-feeling-intimated-when-she-first-met-her-thangalaan-co-star-chiyaan-vikram-i-cannot-imagine-1334248">Malavika Mohanan</a> who stood out with her role as Aarathi, the sorceress the most.</p>

<p>The actress has given a breakout performance in her filmography that goes beyond her glamorous avatar in real life. The starlet sharing the screen with Vikram has managed to bring out a whole new layer of her skills which makes us want more.</p>

<h3 id="66bdc51acbf8b"><strong>The Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>Thangalaan, featuring Chiyaan Vikram and helmed by director Pa Ranjith, presents a compelling narrative of resilience, struggle, and survival, all set against an adventurous backdrop. The film intricately explores the nuanced complexities of its situations, revealing that they cannot be easily categorized as merely right or wrong.</p>

<p>If you are someone who loves to be immersed in a world that is mixed with history and power, then the film is truly a cinematic journey meant for you to experience.</p>

<p>Akshay Kumar is in great form. The actor essays the role of Dr Rishabh, effortlessly,&nbsp;and&nbsp;nails it in the comedic&nbsp;portions as well as the dramatic portions.

<h2 id="66bd488712f36"><strong>Final Verdict of Khel Khel Mein:</strong></h2>

<p>Khel Khel Mein has laugh out loud moments and also has deep messaging. While the blend could have been more seamess and convincing for more impact, there&#39;s no denying that Khel Khel Mein is quite a credible film and gets a lot of things right.</p>

<p>Shraddha Kapoor&#39;s performance is ordinary. Her dialogue delivery often feels mechanical instead of feeling natural.<br />

<p>John Abraham as ex-soldier Abhimanyu is excellent. And what can we even say about his insane action!<br />
Sharvari as Vedaa shows signs of a bonafide superstar. She is terrific as the girl who wants to make a difference. One of her action scenes in the second half is so massy that you will be compelled to hoot and clap.<br />
Abhishek Banerjee as the man with power is menacing. What a multi-talented actor he is!<br />

<p>Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, despite interesting characters and solid performances, fumbles because of the juvenile plot, lack of thrill and an anti-climatic finale. There was so much potential but it is wasted.<br />

The documentary titled Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli tells the vibrant tale of a master craftsman in his journey from being a daily soap director to a global sensation.</p>

<p>The documentary directed by Raghav Khanna and co-director Tanvi Ajinkya comprises several interviews featuring celebrities including stars like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-and-mrunal-thakurs-film-with-director-hanu-raghavapadi-is-based-on-razakar-movement-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-1333708">Prabhas</a>, Ram Charan, Jr NTR, and Rana Daggubati.

<h2 id="66cda00d81b2e"><strong>Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli - Review</strong></h2>

<p>The documentary Modern Masters: SS Rajamouli starts off slow, introducing the audience to the reception that RRR had received for its release in Japan. The documentary starts with Rajamouli, Jr NTR, and Ram Charan&nbsp;attending a screening of the film&nbsp;in Japan, meeting the audience. It then shifts to the actual show, feat. various interviews and montages of footage, photos, and videos.</p>

<p>Retracing his steps to the formative years, SS Rajamouli is interviewed on his childhood days, personal life, and relationships with his team. He recounts how he was brought up in a family that was embedded in cinema values and a deep sense of storytelling.</p>

<p>Owing to his initial growth towards his mother, Rajamouli defines how she was an integral part of his knack for storytelling and would prompt him to play outside and hear stories. The director also recounts the formative years his father, famous writer Vijayendra Prasad had to face in terms of working in cinema.</p>

<p>As their family was not reaping success for the movies they had envisioned making, the director shifted from Chennai to Hyderabad to make a living for himself, which launched the early stages of his career. The start of his directing journey began when he collaborated with Raghavendra Rao in a short film for the Andhra Pradesh government.</p>

<p>Making his way into direction, the avid craftsman&nbsp;worked as the director for the serial Santhi Nivasam and later moved into commercial cinema with Student No. 1 starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/janhvi-kapoor-is-in-love-with-shooting-for-devara-shares-a-pic-while-savouring-a-feast-on-sets-of-jr-ntr-starrer-1334152">Jr NTR</a>.</p>

<p>The documentary does not only capture the essence of his films and how they transformed the landscape of Telugu movies but also emphasizes the relationships he had developed with his craft.</p>

<p>The interviews of the documentary feature actors like Jr NTR,<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ram-charan-wife-upasana-drenched-in-high-spirit-at-2024-paris-olympics-inauguration-ceremony-with-chiranjeevi-and-family-1332585"> Ram Charan</a>, Rana Daggubati, and Prabhas. While the Darling actor&nbsp;calls the director a &lsquo;mad man&rsquo; for his way of working, NTR and Ram depict how the man is a stickler for perfectionism and would take multiple takes till it is just the way he wants.</p>

<p>Other than the stars, the documentary also features filmmakers like James Cameron, Joe Russo, and Karan Johar talking about the euphoric nature of his movies and the grandeur at which they scaled up. Calling him a visionary and a legend, the filmmakers tout him to be one of a kind in our generation.</p>

<p>The Avatar director even added on feeling honored after hearing SS Rajamouli is considered the &lsquo;James Cameron of India&#39;,&nbsp;for his spectacles and craft over the years.</p>

<p>With various details about his films like Simhadri, Eega, Magadheera, and Baahubali 1 and Baahubali&nbsp;2 being discussed, we also see a different angle towards the director in his personal life. On account of the words of his wife Rama, son Karthikeya, and father Vijayendra Prasad, the documentary reveals much more about the artist within him and what makes him human.</p>

<p>On account of his personal life, the director also sheds light on his atheistic values while also being profoundly fascinated by interesting mythology characters. Furthermore, the director also talks about the initial challenges they faced after Baahubali 1&rsquo;s release, the casteist and misogynistic remarks made against it, and how it was all misunderstood by some strata of people.</p>

<h3><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work in the documentary</strong></h3>

<p>Even though the 1 hour and 14-minute long documentary largely covers the highs and lows of the director&rsquo;s life, it does fail to mention some of his greatest hits like Chatrapathi, Vikramarkudu, and Yamadonga.</p>

<p>Far from discussing details about them, these movies were not even mentioned in the documentary, making it feel like a large part of his filmography was being missed out on.</p>

<h3><strong>The Verdict</strong></h3>

<p>If you are an aspiring filmmaker or have a general love for the craft and making of films by SS Rajamouli, then this documentary is surely made for you.</p>

<p>The documentary not only gives some BTS developments of some blockbuster films but also relates to the account of struggling to land a foothold, even if one&rsquo;s a legend.</p>

<p>Ajay Devgn as Krishna delivers a good performance. However, the film is so bland that acting can do nothing to save it. Same goes for Tabu, who although is dependable as an actress, can&#39;t overpower this lethargic story.<br />
Shantanu Maheshwari and Saiee Manjrekar do well and their portions are relatively more engaging.<br />

<h2 id="66ad2620eaa9f"><strong>Final Verdict of Auron Mein Kaha Dum Tha</strong></h2>

<p>Auron Mein Kahan Dum Tha is an irredeemable film. The line from the film - &#39;Dushman The Hi Hum Apne, Auron Mein Kaha Dum Tha&#39; (We were our own enemies, others didn&#39;t have the guts) is totally apt for the ones who voluntarily agreed to go ahead with the film&#39;s subject matter.</p>

<p>Janhvi Kapoor as DHC Suhana Bhatia carries herself very well on screen. She has a striking personality. There is genuinity on display in terms of performance but the character demanded more than that, especially in the breakdown scenes.<br />
Gulshan Devaiah is terrifyingly brilliant.<br />

The web series which is available on Sony LIV is an investigative thriller which is filled with suspense.</p>

<p>With actors Ravindra Vijay and Anand Sami playing prominent roles, the series takes quite a dark and twisted tale that also explores themes of blind superstition. If planning to watch the show, check out the Pinkvilla review!</p>

<h2 id="66cd9f9710686"><strong>The Plot:</strong></h2>

<p>Brinda focuses on the tale of a newly appointed sub-inspector at a police station in Hyderabad. Owing to her cold nature, she is often viewed as stubborn and arrogant, displeasing many people. Along with this, the police officer also has a rough relationship with her sister.</p>

<p>However, things take a dark turn when a mysterious body is found leading the police to open a can full of terror and a possible serial assassin. The rest of the series focuses on how Brinda along with her team manages to uncover the truth while also learning more about her own life.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9f9710698"><strong>The Good:</strong></h3>

<p>Brinda is a highly engaging investigative thriller that is supported by a strong and well-researched screenplay. The show starts off slow, taking its time to establish the lead protagonist and the supporting characters. Along with the introduction of the characters, we also get introduced to the theme of the series right off the bat, making it easier to grasp and have a fluid understanding of the investigation.</p>

<p>Talking about the writing of the show, director Surya Manoj Vangala&nbsp;has magnificently executed a well-driven narrative for the protagonist, connecting her with the entirety of the show. Even though the character is playing the formidable cop who can&rsquo;t go wrong, the nature of her personality, being flawed with stubbornness and attitude, makes it more interesting to watch.</p>

<p>This flawed nature of the protagonist is balanced with a supposed well-placed and flawless antagonist, which gives us a dynamic nature to the storytelling. The various characters, having their own significance only added to the series experience, despite some being unnecessary.</p>

<p>The series not only gives a thrilling investigative drama but also takes a dig against the notion of blind superstition. The main conflict that stems from such beliefs has been dealt with creatively&nbsp;and with profound crispness.</p>

<p>Talking about the series&#39; technical aspects, the show&rsquo;s biggest backbone is the screenplay and execution done by the director. Despite being a debutant, the filmmaker has weaved an extended and suspenseful world of crime. The dramatic and engaging show was supported by stellar scores, composed by Shakthi Kanth Karthick.</p>

<p>The original tracks and scores of Brinda have managed to give the whole series to be viewed with a top-notch experience, especially with the opening credits. Furthermore, the cinematography by Dinesh K Babu is also to be praised, especially for some low-light sequences.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9f97106ac"><strong>The Bad:</strong></h3>

<p>Coming to the parts that did not work in the show, Brinda fails to create an emotional connection with the audience by portraying her past with her foster family. The relationship the lead character has with her deceased adoptive father fails to establish the same prominence it was meant to be showcased.</p>

<p>Moreover, the relationship she also has with her troubling teenage sister can&nbsp;be annoying for the viewers, but the acting by actress Yashna makes it jarring to sit through. The rebellious nature of the character fails to be fully established despite the show being 8-episodes long.</p>

<p>Along with certain characters that could be avoided, the show suffers from editing errors, especially in its continuity. The smash cuts tend to disconnect from the previous shot, making it a disruption to the fluidity of the show.</p>

<p>Moreover, the show also has taken hits in the usage of VFX, making scenes seem amateurish and poorly executed.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9f97106b1"><strong>The Performance:</strong></h3>

<p>Talking about the performances in Brinda, the show has to be credited to the nuanced portrayals by actors <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/trisha-krishnans-upcoming-films-from-kamal-haasan-starrer-thug-life-to-chiranjeevis-vishwambhara-1302143">Trisha Krishnan</a> and Indrajith Sukumaran. Being the lead character, the actress has successfully managed to present a tormented soul searching for her past while also trying to investigate a gruesome case.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Indrajith Sukumaran who arrives in the series a bit later on, quickly grasps the attention of the viewers with his subtle mannerisms and collected nature. The character given to the talented actor is well-suited for him, allowing for organic growth.</p>

<p>Furthermore, actors <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/aarambham-ott-release-when-and-where-to-watch-this-telugu-sci-fi-drama-starring-mohan-bhagath-1308076">Ravindra Vijay</a> and Anand Sami support the whole plot with their energy and offer the viewers an entertaining experience. Their characters serve the progression of the plot with ease and make us want more of them to be on the screen. Additionally, the acting by Sandeep Jawaharilal Sahu is also commendable.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9f97106b6"><strong>The Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>Brinda is a well-made thrilling investigative drama&nbsp;filled with suspense. The show easily manages to capture the intrigue and take on an engaging journey through the dark mysteries of its world.</p>

<p>If you love watching Telugu thriller web series with suspense and twists, then surely watch this show.</p>

<p>Like any other film, Raayan is not without flaws. While the film is technically brilliant, it lags behind when it comes to the story. Raayan&rsquo;s story follows the same betrayal and revenge arc, something that has been seen time and again in Indian cinema. While the scripting is quite good, there is only so much that dialogues can do to help when the story itself is something that has been seen before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the film&rsquo;s first half is brilliantly placed, and ends with an extraordinary interval block, the film&rsquo;s second half seems to hit the brakes. The film slows down drastically, while the events taking place feel quite predictable. However, that being said, the film does have its fair share of goosebumps-generating moments. The film, while edited brilliantly, still could have afforded to be 5-10 minutes shorter.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Raayan</strong></h3>

<p>Going hand in hand with the technical brilliance of Raayan are the wonderful performances by all the cast members. While Dhanush as Kathavaraayan steals the show, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/sundeep-kishan-reacts-to-accusations-by-food-safety-department-says-exaggerated-instant-headlines-culture-1327239">Sundeep Kishan&rsquo;s </a>Muthuvel Raayan, Kalidas Jayaram&rsquo;s Manickam, Dushara Vijayan&rsquo;s Durga, Selvaraghavan&rsquo;s Sekar, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/sj-suryah-lays-down-immense-praise-for-dhanushs-upcoming-flick-raayan-says-my-character-is-like-that-of-a-wolf-1330273">SJ Suryah&rsquo;s </a>Sethu, and all other characters portray their roles exceptionally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, all throughout the film, the characters have been given and equated with animalistic qualities like those of lions and wolves. The actors have done a fantastic job imbibing these characteristics and portraying them on screen.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict for Raayan</strong></h3>

<p>Despite the obvious flaws, Raayan deserves to be watched in theaters, especially for the beautiful visuals, and camerawork, as well as the beautiful music by AR Rahman. Dhanush as the director brings a flair of the Tamil gangster action flicks from the late 2000s, but with a modern twist, which works out wonderfully on the silver screen. Everything said Raayan passes off as a good one-time-watch, guaranteeing an emotional yet fun ride that one can catch with their friends.</p>

<p>Vicky Kaushal as Akhil Chaddha is seamless, be it in the comedy scenes&nbsp;or the dramatic and romantic scenes. Ammy Virk as Gurbir Pannu is an absolute&nbsp;joy to watch. Triptii Dimri as Saloni Bagga is pretty good in her role but there is scope for better. Neha Dhupia and Sheeba Chaddha lend able support. Other supporting actors are formidable.

<h2 id="669f3407bff6d"><strong>Final Verdict Of Bad Newz:</strong></h2>

<p>Bad Newz is an unadulterated fun entertainer with potential that&#39;s left untapped. The concept of the film had much more scope for a deeper and broader messaging but it gets reduced to a movie you watch for a few laughs and gags, before getting on with your life.</p>

<p>Akshay Kumar delivers a phenomenal performance as Vir Mhatre. He is one of the most natural actors that you would see on screen. Radhikka Madan is simply outstanding in her empowering role of Rani.

The movie directed by Nag Ashwin brings in a story that originates from the tales of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and the prophecized 10th avatar of Lord Vishnu, according to the myth.</p>

<p>With an ensemble cast of actors like Disha Patani, Rajendra Prasad, Shobana, Anna Ben, Saswata Chatterjee, Brahmanandam, and many more, the film encapsulates a large tale. With cameo performances by Dulquer Salmaan and Vijay Deverakonda already confirmed by the makers, here is the Pinkvilla review for the movie Kalki 2898 AD.</p>

<h2 id="667d2d82f041f"><strong>The Plot:</strong></h2>

<p>The story of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/kalki-2898-ad">Kalki 2898 AD</a> starts at the end of Mahabharata&rsquo;s Kurukshetra War, marking the beginning of the Kali Yuga in the year 3102 BC. After the events of Mahabharata, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna to protect his final avatar when the time is right.</p>

<p>6000 years later, in 2898 AD, the world has become dreadful for most people who live under the fear of the proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to please him and get a humble abode in his resourceful land called Complex, others rebel against him and his atrocities.</p>

<p>As all rays of hope seem to diminish for the people, a new light seemingly takes place in the form of an unborn child in SUM-80 alias Sumathi&rsquo;s womb. With Yaskin and his followers set to extract the life source out of the child, an epic tale brews which sets up the rest of the film.</p>

<h3><strong>The Good:</strong></h3>

<p>Kalki 2898 AD is truly an epic tale that is meant for every movie lover who enjoys watching mythological tales and science fiction action thrillers. The movie headlined by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/prabhas">Prabhas</a> features him as Bhairava, a bounty hunter whose only dream is to reach the Complex and have a lavish life. As always, the Rebel Star personified a charming and magnetic screen presence which makes us want to hoot and cheer for him as soon as he appears on the screen.</p>

<p>However, the biggest show stealer from the movie would be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/amitabh-bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> as Ashwatthama. The actor once again established why he is the veteran superstar of Indian cinema with his action sequences and demeanor who would go to great extends to fulfill his duty. The combination of scenes between Big B and Prabhas gives&nbsp;birth to some of the finest combat sequences that have existed in Indian cinema.</p>

<p>Besides these two stars, the movie features Kamal Haasan as the Supreme Yaskin and Deepika as Sumathi, who were diabolical in the characters given to them. Taking Haasan&rsquo;s name in particular, the actor only gave a screen time of&nbsp;a few minutes that too in just a couple of scenes, but in just a matter of moments, we can sense his strong presence which makes us anxious about what he has planned next.</p>

<p>Disha Patani also makes an appearance as Bhairava&rsquo;s love interest which gives a truly fresh chemistry on the screen, despite the subplot being a bit random. Furthermore, many characters are played by some interesting celebrities who made cameo appearances in the film which are surely going to be a treat for many people.</p>

<p>Coming to the other aspects of the movie, Kalki 2898 AD stands strong on a well-written screenplay which goes&nbsp;hand-in-hand with the visually stunning camera work. The shots captured by Djordje Stojiljkovic transport us&nbsp;into a new world seamlessly without having to make us question the likelihood of all the events happening.</p>

<p>The directorial execution by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/nag-ashwin">Nag Ashwin</a> with his highly creative and imaginative story presents&nbsp;a movie that creates goosebumps as we watch. The way the director intertwines the storylines and characters into a vast world like this is commendable. Besides the director&rsquo;s efforts, the musical expertise of Santhosh Narayanan once again adds the necessary factors to make this dystopian world a treat to watch, making us thump in excitement.</p>

<p>Finally, the production design by Nitin Zihani Choudhary and the editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao is undoubtedly a worthy factor in this epic story making its way to the masses.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bad:</strong></h3>

<p>Kalki 2898 AD is an epic movie as it comes which is reminiscent of great Hollywood films like Star Wars and Dune. However, the flick did have some letdowns in the first half which made it a bit barring and struggling to continue organically.</p>

<p>Many of the scenes featuring Prabhas in the introduction had a few comical cues which made it a bit off the topic and rather appeared as a pure fan service. The heroic element of the character is presented in a truly dynamic way in the second half which was far superior to the latter.</p>

<p>Besides the inorganic comic reliefs, the subplot of Anna Ben&rsquo;s character Kyra did not serve a big emotional connection as much as it was instigated to become. Moreover, even though the film encapsulates a global scale of events with multiple characters coming together from various origins, they all seem to speak a single language but even then can&rsquo;t seem to get rid of their accents.</p>

<h3><strong>The Performance:</strong></h3>

<p>Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/deepika-padukone">Deepika Padukone</a> lead this epic show on their shoulders, giving a never-before-seen experience for film lovers in India. The potential of the world created by Nag Ashwin was shown only a glimpse through this movie and the characters already gave a peek&nbsp;of who they truly are, leaving us wanting more out of the world.</p>

<p>Besides the lead characters and a stellar performance by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/kamal-haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>, the film boasted an ensemble cast of actors like Rajendra Prasad, Shobhana, Saswata Chatterjee, and many more who made their presence known in just a matter of minutes. Moreover, the comedic timing of Brahmanandam gave&nbsp;a few laughs with Keerthy Suresh voicing the AI Droid vehicle Bujji with a persona unique as it comes.</p>

<h3><strong>The Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>The movie Kalki 2898 AD is just the beginning of a cinematic universe that has the potential to become the greatest experience in Indian cinema. With each character serving their own purposes, the film successfully connects the world of sci-fi and myth under a single umbrella.</p>

<p>If you are a lover of films which has a grand scale, epic narration, amazing visuals, groundbreaking performances, and unbelievable storytelling, then surely watch this feast of a movie in the&nbsp;screens near you.</p>

<p>Kartik Aaryan essays the role of Murlikant Petkar with utmost honesty. His physical transformation is laudable. The efforts put in by him for the film are clearly visible. The actor, with Chandu Champion, has proven that he is no &#39;Chandu&#39; when it comes to acting. Yes, the wide smile can be toned down a little.<br />
Ayan Khan Sroha as the young Murlikant Petkar does his job perfectly.<br />

<p>Despite a novel idea, the film doesn&#39;t turn out to be as good as it should&#39;ve been. The first half is flat, with hardly any moment that lets the audience live a cinematic high. It picks up slightly in the second half due to the conflict between the couple but stays below the mark.</p>

<p>The screenplay has some good moments, but the build-up is not strong enough to make you root for the couple and wish to see them together. In fact, the finale also appears hurried. A film that could&#39;ve been a good romantic sports drama lands nowhere because it neither gives you a satisfying romance nor an engaging sports drama. It&#39;s also because sports dramas have become highly predictable at this stage. When the screenplay doesn&#39;t provide you with any unpredictable or exciting moments, you just lose interest.</p>

<h2 id="6658d27a5806d">Performances in Mr &amp; Mrs Mahi</h2>

<p>Rajkummar Rao is one of the finest actors in Bollywood, and he proves it again by giving a good performance. He could&#39;ve been better in the comedy scenes, though.</p>

<p>Janhvi Kapoor shines throughout the film. Be it the scenes where she has to show her character&#39;s innocent side or the emotional ones where she has to cry; she has done a commendable job. The hard work she has put in her acting and playing the cricket shows onscreen.</p>

<p>Zarina Wahab, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/kumud-mishra">Kumud Mishra</a>, and Rajesh Mishra have a few moments in which they shine.</p>

<p>Director Sharan Sharma does well in getting good performances from the film&#39;s star cast. However, the screenplay he has written along with Nikhil Mehrotra doesn&#39;t let the movie rise to a point where it could be called a good entertainer.</p>

<h2 id="6658d27a58070">Final Verdict of Mr &amp; Mrs Mahi</h2>

<p>Mr &amp; Mrs Mahi is a missed opportunity. A film that could&#39;ve shined bright among the recent sports dramas stands among the above-average ones.</p>

<h2 id="6654d161d45ac"><strong>Final Verdict of Panchayat 3:</strong></h2>

<p>Panchayat 3 manages to retain the essence of its previous seasons and that is a reason enough to watch it. However, the writing doesn&#39;t do justice to the level of show that it is. Also, there are pacing issues that need to be addressed.<br />

<p>Turbo starring Mammootty in the lead role features the story of an Idukki-based jeep driver, popularly known as Turbo Jose. Notorious for his spontaneous and unpredictable manner, this mama&rsquo;s boy inadvertently ends up in the city of Chennai. However, things start to take a turn for the worse when Jose locks horns with an infamous kingpin, Vetrivel Shanmugha Sundaram. Does Jose manage to beat them and mark an end to their troubles?</p>

<h3><strong>The Good:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Turbo is completely a mass action commercial movie that rides heavily on the star power of Megastar Mammootty. From the very introduction to the film itself, the makers have managed to capitalize on the actor&rsquo;s star image even going on to show a blaring sign of &ldquo;Megastar&rdquo; in the background.</p>

<p>In addition to the iconic actor&#39;s appearance, the film greatly relies on the villainous and intimidating portrayal of Raj B Shetty from Kannada. Undoubtedly, the actor perfectly embodies the role of a formidable antagonist, ensuring that the plot remains interesting&nbsp;and engaging. Together, these talented actors elevate the movie&#39;s second half and climax to an exhilarating level of action.</p>

<p>Other than them, actress Bindu Panicker truly stole the show by playing Jose&rsquo;s mother, who is the only person the protagonist fears in the entirety of the film. The bond between the two actors as mother and son was the most outstanding emotional connection depicted in the movie. Additionally, Anjana Jayaprakash, Shabareesh Varma, and Sunil, among other actors, also delivered noteworthy performances, establishing both emotional connections and comedic moments.</p>

<p>Coming to the technical brilliance of the film, the movie&rsquo;s backbone was the blaring and energetic background scores composed by Christo Xavier. Be it the Turbo Jose theme or Burnout The Engine, both tracks stood out making it a thrilling experience for the viewers. The craftsmanship executed by Xavier should be praised equally to his contemporaries in Malayalam cinema like Sushin Shyam and Rex Vijayan.</p>

<p>The direction by Vysakh in his third collaboration with Mammootty truly made it clear why he is well-known for executing commercial movies. Even though the movie is packed with action movie cliches, it also makes an effort to play around with meta narration, occasionally poking fun at its own cliches.</p>

<p>The cinematography deserves special praise for its creative shots and subtle lighting that enhances the scenes. The film maintains a similar aesthetic to Vysakh&#39;s recent works, which are executed effectively in this instance.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the biggest boon for Turbo is the stunts that were included in the entire movie. Especially&nbsp;in the second half of the Mammootty starrer, the actions were solid and gave a sort of euphoric high with the gravity-defying punches by the Megastar.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bad:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Turbo is definitely not your cup of tea if you&#39;re walking in with the expectation of seeing Mammootty in an experimental role like in Kaathal or Bramayugam. The film is a celebration of the Megastar who effortlessly transitions into an action movie reminiscent of his earlier years.</p>

<p>Taking the words of Midhun Manuel Thomas himself, a movie always relies on the strength of a good screenplay. However, the biggest problem with Turbo was the screenplay itself. Particularly in the first half of the movie, the film tests your patience with certain old-school comedy elements. While the second half and climax exceeded expectations, the first half and amateurish interval block were filled&nbsp;with cringe-worthy and out-of-place dialogues.</p>

<p>Though Midhun often expressed his love for Marvel action movies, the film seemed to rely on comedic tropes dusted off from old Malayalam flicks. Additionally, the film&#39;s editing is lacking in certain places, especially with jump cuts that miss some crucial shots of the action sequences, which would have enhanced the cinematic experience.</p>

<h3><strong>The Performance:</strong></h3>

<p>Turbo is without any doubt riding on the strong shoulders of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/mammootty">Mammootty</a> in the lead. The movie offers a stellar action-filled realm of cinema that can be associated with themes of escapism. With this in mind, the film presents both a great protagonist and antagonist who we can root for and cheer for.</p>

<p>Raj B Shetty, playing the adversary to Turbo Jose, provides a dynamic to-and-fro for the latter&nbsp;who even gets fed up with not besting him. A blood-riddled fistfight where all odds converge is surely a treat for Mammukka fans who may have wanted to see him in a mass and meaty role like this one.</p>

<p>With Bindu Panicker, who is actually 16 years younger than the actor, playing his mother, she manages to become a cute and lovable mother who holds the reins to her son. The undying emotion they share, backed by strong conviction, is definitely a saving grace in the movie.</p>

<p>Sunil&#39;s comedic timing as Auto Billa adds to the movie&#39;s charm, especially when he hilariously parodies Marlon Brando&#39;s character from The Godfather. Additionally, Anjana Jayaprakash and Shabareesh Varma bring depth and emotion to the film, although there are moments when their performances can be both admirable and bothersome.</p>

<h3><strong>The Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>For anyone who wishes to see a highly entertaining action comedy with its peak moments or if you love seeing Mammootty in a mass role, then surely go and watch Turbo in theaters near you.</p>

<p>The 2-and-a-half-hour flick would surely satisfy many movie lovers who are craving an out-and-out action movie. Like Raj B Shetty said in a previous interview, &ldquo;Some movies are made to touch life. Some movies are made to forget life,&rdquo; and Turbo is definitely made to forget life and to enjoy it that way alone.</p>

<p>On a side note, for anyone who is a fan of Jawan or Tamil cinema in particular, make sure to stick around for the tail-end for a surprise, potentially leading to a sequel.</p>

<p>Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil is a total paisa vasool entertainer&nbsp; that came in Mollywood, similar to Priyadarshan&#39;s classic comedy movies of 90s and 2000s. Humor is the backbone of this movie, thanks to Vipin Das and writer Deepu Pradeep, known for Kunjiramayanam for that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The humor in the story flows effortlessly. The movie showcases a variety of funny characters with over-the-top comedic qualities, and most of the funny scenes really land.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9fd556d2f"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work in Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil</strong></h3>

<p>Guruvayoor Ambalanadayi couldn&#39;t repeat the magic of Vipin Das&#39; earlier outing with Basil Joseph Jaya Jaya Jaya Jaya Hey, which had a more organic approach to satirical comedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil, the humor often feels forced. Also the overuse of cine-references takes away from the overall enjoyment of the film. The repetition of these references also hampers the mood at times and hinders the movie from reaching its maximum potential.</p>

<p>This film lacks the Midas touch evident in Vipin Das and Deepu Pradeep&#39;s other works, so it doesn&#39;t deliver the same impact. Also, Ankit Menon&#39;s music does not leave a lasting impression, adding to the disappointment.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9fd556d33"><strong>Performances in Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil</strong></h3>

<p>In Guruvayoor Ambala Nadayil, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/prithviraj-sukumaran" target="_blank">Prithviraj</a> surprises the audience with a never-seen-before comedy avatar and delivers a good humorous performance throughout the film. On the other hand, Basil Joseph portrays the character of Vinu in his own style and shows his talent as he did in his earlier roles in movies like Jaya Jaya Jaya Jaya Hey, Falimy and Jane Man. The strong performances of the leads are the backbone of this film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While heroines of the movie Anaswara Rajan and Nikhila Vimal give decent performances, their roles do not offer much depth.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/yogi-babu" target="_blank">Yogi Babu</a>&#39;s Malayalam debut is forgettable as his comedy numbers fail to bring laughter.</p>

<h3 id="66cd9fd556d37"><strong>Verdict of Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil</strong></h3>

<p>Guruvayoor Ambalanadayil might not be the type of comedy film that appeals to everyone, especially if you&#39;re anticipating another Jaya Jaya Jaya Jaya Hey from the director.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the movie has aspects that can draw in families to the cinemas. Prithviraj&#39;s delightful portrayal in a comedic character is certainly noteworthy. However, the film may only be worth watching once, at most.</p>

<p>Vijay Raaz is exceptional as Inspector Shivrajrao Jende. He has such a magnetic screen presence that you want him in every frame of the show.

<p>David Padikkal, played by Tovino Thomas, is an accidental superstar and is currently facing a series of box-office failures and questions about his ability to act. However, David does not mind the criticisms he gets and lives his life in parties, booze, drugs, and women.</p>

<p>Despite his never-mind attitude, David decides to stage a comeback in his career. His manager approaches Bala, portrayed by Soubin Shahir, an acting coach with a background in drama, to teach him how to act.</p>

<p>However, the unconventional methods of Bala initially come into conflict with David&#39;s ego. However, as David begins to see improvement in his acting under Bala&#39;s visionary approaches, he decides to reconsider Bala&#39;s approach. The major question of Nadikar revolves around whether David Padikkal, a superstar who is emotionless and devoid of meaningful relationships, can be transformed into a good actor.</p>

<h3><strong>What works in Nadikar&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Nadikar is a visual treat like Tovino&#39;s 2022 super hit Thallumaala. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/tovino-thomas">Tovino Thomas</a> enacts a stylish character with great strength and style. David Padikkal&#39;s character in Nadikar blends well with an actor&#39;s glamorous lifestyle, something above what we saw in Prithviraj&#39;s character in Driving License.</p>

<p>Further, humor is employed throughout the movie, and the jokes, with their witty one-liners and clever pop culture references, do a great job of evoking laughter.</p>

<h3><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work in Nadikar</strong></h3>

<p>The script of Nadikar was let down by the writers Suvin S. Somasekharan and Lal Jr. Though it was Tovino who had to shoulder the burden of an average script, Lal Jr. was unable to balance with his direction.</p>

<p>The average music, composed by Yakzan Gary Pereira and Neha Nair, was also a disappointment. To top it all, the overuse of inanities like curses and blasphemies, which added nothing to the story, created an adverse effect in all aspects.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Nadikar</strong></h3>

<p>Tovino Thomas gave a good performance as David Padikkal. He brought the life of a superstar to the screen in a manner similar to Prithviraj in the 2019 movie Driving License, directed by Lal Jr.</p>

<p>Playing Ann Bava, David&#39;s ex-girlfriend and struggling actress, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/bhavana-menon">Bhavana</a> also gave a fine performance and continues to be known for her acting skills. Soubin Shahir plays Bala and provides a good insight into the movie, but his performance was similar to some of his old roles. Both Balu Varghese and Suresh Krishna are able to act to decent standards.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Nadikar</strong></h3>

<p>Overall, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/nadikar">Nadikar</a> is an average film that has its echoes in Lal Jr.&#39;s 2019 film Driving License, which features Prithviraj Sukumaran. However, Nadikar does not have the muscle of a strong script like the late Sachi did in Driving License. If you are a fan of Tovino Thomas and Bhavana, Nadikar could be a decent one-time watch; otherwise, it&rsquo;s avoidable.</p>

Dijo returns to the big screen with another socio-political drama delving into the divisive world of hatred politics. Loosely inspired by the 2015 Bollywood blockbuster Bajrangi Bhaijaan starring Salman Khan, Malayalee from India aims to dissect societal prejudices and biases.</p>

<p>Dijo Jose Antony achieved significant acclaim with his previous movies, Queen and particularly Jana Gana Mana, which earned nationwide attention upon its Netflix release for its astute political commentary. When Dijo joined hands with Nivin Pauly, who is riding high on the success of the superhit Varshangalkku Shesham, released in April, the expectations were sky high.</p>

<p>But does Malayalee from India resonate as strongly as Prithviraj starrer Jana Gana Mana? Let&#39;s delve into it and see if it strikes a chord with the audience.</p>

<h2 id="66325fedb5dfb"><strong>Plot of Malayalee from India</strong></h2>

<p>Malayalee from India narrates the story in the pre-COVID-19 era, where <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/nayanthara-and-nivin-pauly-reunite-after-5-years-for-fun-and-gripping-film-dear-students-watch-1295378" target="_blank">Nivin Pauly</a> dons the lead role of Aalparambil Gopi, a carefree, pseudo-nationalist living in a village with a rich Theyyam tradition, Mullakkara, in Kannur district. Gopi&#39;s best buddy, Malghosh, played by Varshangalkku Shesham star Dhyan Sreenivasan, shares Gopi&rsquo;s ideologies, and together, they often engage in communal politics, knowingly and unknowingly. Despite Gopi&#39;s reluctance to work, his mother, Suma (Manju Pillai), supports the family.</p>

<p>Due to Malghosh&#39;s reckless behavior, Gopi is forced to flee to the Gulf, specifically a farm reigned over by a Pakistani overseer, sparking Gopi&#39;s deep-seated animosity towards Pakistan. However, because of circumstances, Gopi had to work with the Pakistani, making Gopi perceive life differently.</p>

<p>As COVID-19 strikes, they find themselves stuck at the farm. Through their shared experiences, Gopi undergoes a transformation. Will he return home the same, or will he be a changed man? Malayalee from India holds the answers.</p>

<h3 id="66325fedb5e06"><strong>What works for Malayalee from India?</strong></h3>

<p>The first half of Malayalee from India is more like a political satire narrated with a humorous background. The film&#39;s use of humor worked quite well, as the audience enjoyed the one-liners and the comical situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chemistry between Nivin Pauly and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/dhyan-sreenivasan#:~:text=Dhyan%20Sreenivasan%20works%20in%20Malayalam,his%20elder%20brother%20Vineeth%20Sreenivasan." target="_blank">Dhyan Sreenivasan</a> was quite entertaining for the audience. They delivered enjoyable performances, and the on-screen chemistry between the two added to the fun factor of the film.</p>

<h3 id="66325fedb5e2a"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Malayalee from India?</strong></h3>

<p>Malayalee from India relied heavily on forced nationalism elements that failed to connect with the audiences. Many cringe-worthy scenes felt akin to certain amateur Instagram reels, displaying a sense of pseudo-secularism and pseudo-nationalism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second half&#39;s attempt at a survival thriller falls flat and misses the mark. Moreover, the movie&#39;s climax, borrowing heavily from Bajrangi Bhaijaan without emotions, fails to make an impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The songs are average and fail to leave a lasting impression, while the background score lacks the necessary punch. Dijo couldn&#39;t replicate the top-notch making of Jana Gana Mana with this film.</p>

<h3 id="66325fedb5e2f"><strong>Performances in Malayalee from India&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Nivin Pauly gives a very good performance as Aalparambil Gopi, and he invests in his character with real emotion and sincerity. His characterization is reflected very well, especially in the comedic scenes, with his trademark brilliance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Manju Pillai played Suma, Gopi&#39;s mother, who is strong and energetic. She breathes life into her character through her struggle and vitality. Anaswara Rajan is very good in the limited screen time given to her, with decent performances in a few scenes. In the same light, Salim Kumar is also excellent and shines in his limited screen time.</p>

<h3 id="66325fedb5e33"><strong>Verdict of Malayalee from India&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Malayalee From India is Dijo Jose Antony&#39;s mediocre third outing. While it may offer a chance to catch up on Nivin Pauly&#39;s comic skills if you have been missing his humor roles, the film ultimately falls short due to Sharis Mohammed&#39;s average script and Dijo Jose Antony&#39;s uninspired direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since Malayalam cinema has seen a string of back-to-back blockbusters in 2024, Malayalee From India appears to be a misfired attempt that fails to meet the general industry standards.</p>

<p>No film devoid of flaws, and Vineeth Sreenivasan&rsquo;s Varshangalkku Shesham is no different. The first half of the film, fully set in the 1970s, showcases several scenes between <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/pranav-mohanlal">Pranav Mohanlal </a>and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/kalyani-priyadarshan">Kalyani Priyadarshan</a>, where the dialogues seem a bit forced, or rather book-ish. However, that does not take away their performances in the scene, which are portrayed convincingly by the actors. Nonetheless, it is crucial to mention that these dialogues do not last long, and the rest of the film is a visual delight.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Varshangalkku Shesham</strong></h3>

<p>Portraying a character that is 50 years apart is not an easy task, but both <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/dhyan-sreenivasan">Dhyan Sreenivasan </a>and Pranav Mohanlal have done it wonderfully. Varshangalkku Shesham is arguably the best performance by Dhyan Sreenivasan till date. The actor convincingly portrays Venu, an aspiring director, who goes on to achieve his dream, and then sees a downfall as well. Same goes for Pranav Mohanlal, whose character seems to go through a multitude of emotions throughout the film as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/nivin-pauly">Nivin Pauly </a>plays an actor named Nithin Molly in the film, and it was mentioned that Varshangalkku Shesham would be his comeback. The statement holds true at every level. With just a limited screen time, the actor steals the show with his comedic timing, performance and the sheer energy.</p>

<p>The same can be said about the performance of renowned music composer Shaan Rahman, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/basil-joseph">Basil Joseph</a>, Kalyani Priyadarshan, Aju Varghese, Vineeth Sreenivasan and all other actors as well. The major cast of the film are known to be good friends, and their chemistry was visible on screen as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Varshangalkku Shesham</strong></h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the major cast and crew of Varshangalkku Shesham are good friends off-screen as well. This gave the entire film the vibe of a meta podcast, told in a cinematic form, with a lot of internal jokes, and running jokes being addressed in the film, all of which creates a wholesome experience for the audience. Varshangalkku Shesham is a welcome nostalgic trip that deserves a theater watch with one&rsquo;s whole family.</p>

<h2 id="66cd8dc043bb8"><strong>Final Verdict of Amar Singh Chamkila:</strong></h2>

<p>Although Amar Singh Chamkila lacks the emotional depth of Imtiaz Ali films, it offers a very unique kind of cinema which is worth appreciating.<br />

<p>Aavesham revolves around the story of a college-going trio who has&nbsp;recently joined a new college in Bengaluru. Being the victims of ragging and bullying by their seniors, the trio decides to exact revenge against them. Hoping to gain local support, the trio starts hanging around at various bars in the city. By sheer coincidence, they befriend a local goon called Ranga&nbsp;who is set to become their biggest boon or curse!</p>

<h3><strong>The Good:</strong></h3>

<p>Seeing Aavesham on the big screen, we can undoubtedly say that this is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/fahadh-faasil">Fahadh Faasil</a>&#39;s world and we are just existing in it. The film is a complete FaFa&nbsp;show, with the actor playing a totally different avatar from before. Along with the leading actor, the trio of newcomers Mithun, Hipzter, and Roshan also carry the film on their shoulders, despite being debutants in feature films. Sajin Gopu who also played a key role in Romancham also steals the show with his character.</p>

<p>The simple approach of the plot, with a relatable screenplay and premise not only offers a wild ride but also an entertainment-filled spectacular. The film&#39;s direction by Jithu Madhavan is definitely praiseworthy. Sameer Thahir who uses his camera magic also provides some magnificent visuals, especially with the use of color lights in emphasising the scene.</p>

<p>The editing done by Vivek Harshan is also a backbone in making the film, but the greatest technical brilliance is by Sushin Shyam. Be it the song Jaada sung by Manjummel&#39;s Sreenath Bhasi or let it be the fun track Illuminati, the tracks and scores hold the film together.</p>

<p>A factor that should not be missed while mentioning the film is the costume and styling department for Fahadh Faasil&rsquo;s character. The white-clad costume of FaFa&nbsp;is an identity of the film and the character which serves a great purpose to the plot.</p>

<p>Along with that, the styling department that created the look for Ranga&nbsp;in both his flashback portions and present-day really extends the film&rsquo;s quality. The handlebar mustache and the way Fahadh twirls it, emphasize the character&rsquo;s dominance and presence is a worthy shoutout.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bad:</strong></h3>

<p>Even though the film is funny, wild, and crazy fun, the biggest flaw was the extension of certain scenes in both the first half and second half. The length of certain scenes felt a bit too drawn out in places.</p>

<p>Moreover, the film also felt like it needed more screen time for Fahadh Faasil. Even though the film rides on him, his involvement in the story needed time to be set up which felt like could&#39;ve been earlier. Despite these minor errors, the film does not falter in entertaining you and definitely makes you crack up with laughter.</p>

<h3><strong>The Performance:</strong></h3>

<p>The performances put forth by all the actors, from the lead roles to the minor ones are&nbsp;definitely on timing and fun to watch. The debut trio of actors Hipzster, Mithun Jai Shankar, and Roshan Shanavas is one of the biggest highlights of the film. These actors may not be new faces for people who follow the Malayalam social media world but coming to the realm of cinema, the trio have established that they can effortlessly pull off acting as well.</p>

<p>The newcomer Midhutty, who is also a YouTuber plays one of the antagonists in the film and offers an acting spectacle with his brash character and psychotic nature. Moreover, the film also has Instagram content creator Hari Sivaram playing a supporting role which is set to make him memorable in the future.</p>

<p>Coming to other supporting performances, Sajin Gopu made everyone chuckle with his love for Ranga&nbsp;and the way he carried himself. Knowing everything about the goon&rsquo;s personality, the actor put forth a quirky and fun character.</p>

<p>But the man of the show, the driving force and the beast of the film was none other than Fahadh Faasil. The makers themselves presented the title card as &ldquo;re-introducing&rdquo; FaFa&nbsp;which will make sense once you watch the film. The actor is undoubtedly playing his most unhinged and wildest character ever to date.</p>

<p>The film provides an open space for the actor to perform, making the big screens his kingdom. Every time the actor comes onto the screen with his aura, there&rsquo;s a magical pull that elevates the scene and makes us want to hoot for him. The actor does not even need a massive punchline or an essay&#39;s worth of dialogue but only needs to stare with his eyes through a broken lens. The film absolutely presents a new shade to the character, making us want more and more of the actor.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/aavesham">Aavesham</a> is ideally one of those movies that you could enjoy in theaters if you love a comedy film with a wild ride happening. The show is definitely run by Fahadh Faasil who is all set to entertain you with a great array of actors supporting him.</p>

<p>The wide and crazy ride is not only a laughter-filled vibe of a film but also manages to keep you wanting more of the world. The character sketch of Ranga&nbsp;and his dynamic spontaneity in situations make the film a complete package in the theaters.</p>

<p>So, if you want to experience a 2-and-a-half-hour crazy ride of a film, go and check out Aavesham in theaters near you!</p>

<p>Describing himself as pralay (destruction), Kabir (Prithviraj Sukumaran) returns to seek revenge from the Indian army by abducting an important package necessary for the security of the nation. To resecure the asset, Colonel Azad (Ronit Bose Roy) deputes court-martialled officers Freddy (Akshay Kumar) and Rocky (Tiger Shroff), and are assisted by Misha (Manushi Chhillar) and Pam (Alaya F) during the mission. Unbeknownst to the challenges, Freddy and Rocky meet a friend-turned-foe from the past, who they have to eliminate under any circumstance for the well being of the nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>One of the major challenges of every film of late has been to balance the first half with the second, more often than not one of these being compromised in entertainment, and Ali Abbas Zafar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bade-miyan-chote-miyan-advance-booking-akshay-kumar-tiger-shroff-film-sells-32000-tickets-in-top-national-chains-for-eid-1294312">Bade Miyan Chote Miyan</a> is no different. It is the first half that saves the film with some relatable yet sparsely spread humour, Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff&rsquo;s chemistry, and some suspense to what is going to happen next. Few jokes around being atmanirbhar, Akshay&rsquo;s famous meme-worthy pose from Hera Pheri, and Tiger&rsquo;s &lsquo;Choti Bachi Ho Kya&rsquo; line land well. Usage of drums in the background music for select portions help elevate those dry scenes, but beyond this everything for me goes down the hill in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bade-miyan-chote-miyan-advance-booking-akshay-tiger-film-sells-13000-tickets-in-top-national-chains-for-eid-1294037">Bade Miyan Chote Miyan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is the most abused word of this generation, and Bade Miyan Chote Miyan has only added to that. The concept of Soldier X and Kavach is a puerile piece of writing, sometimes getting too technical and convoluted to fathom. A massy entertainer being unveiled on an important release date with a massy concept with an intention to only entertain was the need of the hour, but too much melodrama especially post interval combined with some underlying jingoism takes away a buddy film genre&rsquo;s novelty away from the project. Even if the mojo of the first half was replicated in the second, the movie would have been far more entertaining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writers Ali Abbas Zafar and Aditya Basu do not optimize the power of humour well in the second half, and combined that with Suraj Gianani&rsquo;s fatuous dialogues only add to the misery of the viewer. For instance, in an opportunity to stir up the audience with some hard hitting Hindi dialogues during an important juncture, the dialogue writer ends up with english lines like &lsquo;Hell is about to be unleashed&rsquo;, &lsquo;Revenge is the purest form of justice&rsquo;, and &lsquo;I am the best&rsquo;, trivializes the moment for a desi audience taking away the energy from it. Despite trying really hard, I was unfortunately unable to empathize with the characters or feel their pain, which is a big letdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, some scenes are stretched, action choreographed by Craig Macrae and Parvez Shaikh is not something that I haven&#39;t seen earlier, production design by Rajnish Hedao, Snigdha Basu and Sumit Basu has no novelty, and DOP Marcin Laskawiec&rsquo;s camera work is mediocre. Overall background music by Julius Packiam could have been better, and music by Vishal Mishra is forgettable. I really wish makers who have forgotten the importance of music for a film today, would at some point rekindle that love, because there is no bigger promotional tool than good music to bring the audience to the theaters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Akshay Kumar once again proves that when it comes to character and alternative comedy there is truly no one like him, but is also underutilized in that aspect in Bade Miyan Chote Miyan. Given an opportunity he could have aced a few more one liners, especially in the second half of the film. Tiger Shroff makes a sincere attempt at comedy with scope of improvement, while his action portrayal has always been top-notch. Prithviraj Sukumaran, a supremely talented actor, is wasted as Kabir, with his one tone, breath heavy dialogue delivery becoming monotonous after a while. Sonakshi Sinha was a good addition to the cast, while Manushi Chhillar and Alaya F were decent in their limited screen time. Ronit Bose Roy stayed true to his part.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I genuinely believe that Ali Abbas Zafar is one of the most promising filmmakers of our times and his sleek and stylish sense of direction is truly classy yet massy. Somehow that seems to be missing in Bade Miyan Chote Miyan. For me, it&#39;s a lost opportunity for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Ajay Devgn breathes life into the character of Syed Abdul Rahim. He is just terrific, especially in the dramatic sequences.<br />

Every Indian football player makes his presence felt, be it Chaitanya Sharma as PK Banerjee, Tejas Ravishankar as Peter Thangaraj, Amartya Ray as Chuni Goswami or Manandeep Singh as Trilok Singh Basera, among others.</p>

<p>Maidaan is a work of passion, that can only be envisioned by someone who is really passionate to tell the underdog story of the Indian National Football Team.

<p>Kareena Kapoor Khan is outstanding. Bebo is never not going to throb hearts.&nbsp;<br />
Tabu is a firecracker. What a delight she is to watch!<br />
Kriti Sanon is good and lights up the screen with her delightful presence.<br />

<p>One would have to nitpick to find faults in a film like Aadujeevitham. However, for someone who has read the novel by Benyamin as well, it is possible they may find the film to be a bit rushed. One major incident from the book is immediately followed by the next in the film, which gives a sense of a time jump. This also means that the extent of cruelty of the Arab in the novel has not been translated onto the silver screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it wouldn&rsquo;t be correct to measure the quality of the film, with the similarity it has to the novel. In fact, the makers of the film have mentioned at the very beginning that the film is an adaptation of the novel, with minute details being changed to match the visual medium. That being said, it is also equally important to mention that the film has covered all important aspects of the book, and more so done justice to the novel as a whole.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Aadujeevitham</strong></h3>

<p>It would not be far-fetched to mention that Aadujeevitham is Prithviraj Sukumaran&rsquo;s career-best performance. The body transformation of the actor, as well as the mental and emotional turmoil, has been wonderfully portrayed by the actor and is sure to make the audience weep at his condition.</p>

<p>Amala Paul&rsquo;s performance as Sainu stands out as well. The filmmaker had added more to Sainu than what was mentioned in the role, however, it blends in seamlessly and does not feel out of place at all.</p>

<p>KR Gokul&rsquo;s performance as Hakeem, Jimmy Jean-Louis as Ibrahim Qadri, and Talib Al Balushi&rsquo;s role as the Khafeel deserve a special mention as well, bringing their respective roles to life. There is one particular sequence of KR Gokul where the actor stands out, bringing tears to the audience&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Final verdict of Aadujeevitham</strong></h3>

<p>Aadujeevitham is a technically sound film with each aspect blending in with the other seamlessly. The exceptional cinematography, and sound quality, as well as the performances by Prithviraj, Amala Paul, and KR Gokul, demand and deserve a theater watch. As mentioned, the film turns a new leaf and sets a new high to the survival thriller genre, and possibly Malayalam cinema as a whole.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/sara-ali-khan">Sara Ali Khan</a>&#39;s performance in Murder Mubarak is a mixed bag.

<h2 id="66e8134108d0d"><strong>Verdict Of Murder Mubarak</strong></h2>

<p>Murder Mubarak has an interesting premise but the film just fails to engage for its most part, as a result of which even the final unveil doesn&#39;t create the desired impact. Also the excess of characters in the film don&#39;t help.</p>

<p>Although Gaami is definitely an attempt worth making note of, it is not without its fair share of flaws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take the initial portions of the film for example, they create a sort of intrigue but are never engaging enough for one to sit up and take notice. For the first 20-30 minutes or so, the film feels lifeless despite the stunning camera work by Vishwanath Reddy and the rousing background score by Naresh.</p>

<p>The constant switching between the stories also feels inorganic initially, and the use of the black screen to transition between shots feels overused throughout the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the major problem in Gaami is its usage of non-linear screenplay. The choice itself worked extraordinarily well; however, the way the non-linear events are structured makes for a complex viewing experience. The filmmaker&#39;s intention to constantly surprise the audience overpowers the intention of telling a powerful story.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Gaami</strong></h3>

<p>Gaami has a mix of both stellar performances as well as some duds. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/vishwak-sen">Vishwak Sen </a>as Shankar is effective in his role, capturing the pain and frustration of living with his rare physical condition. Chandini Chowdary is decent in her role, but the real knockout performance in the film is that of child artist Harika, who is utterly moving in her role. Tumbadd actor Mohammed Samad also puts forth a compelling performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not to pick out the bad apples but some of the performances in the initial portions of the movie are jarring and stick out as amateurish.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Gaami</strong></h3>

<p>Gaami is undoubtedly a commendable attempt from Telugu cinema. It is a unique film with many ambitious ideas, presented with conviction by director Vidhyadhar Kagita. The film is visually breathtaking and conceptually appealing. While the film does get its emotional writing right in the latter portions, the lack of depth in the initial portions and the convoluted screenplay stand out as flaws.</p>

<p>With that being said, Gaami is still an outrageous attempt that deserves to be witnessed for its sheer vision. While it sadly does not live up to its potential, it still offers many high moments throughout its runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something unique to watch on the big screens this weekend, put Gaami at the top of your priority list.</p>

<p>Ajay Devgn as Kabir, essays the role of a family man, superbly well. It&#39;s when he&#39;s his most vulnerable, that he really shines as a performer. His role is a hat tip to his beloved character of Vijay Salgaokar from Drishyam.<br />
R Madhavan as Vanraj is killer, quite literally. He goes full psycho and does all that it takes for the audience to loathe him.<br />
Janki Bodiwala as Janvhi is terrific. What a bloody good performance she has delivered that will surely give her name, fame and recognition.<br />
<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/jyotika">Jyothika</a> as Neha essays her role of a helpless mother with utmost grace and honesty. Her combat scene inside the fateful farmhouse is to watch out for.<br />
Aangad Raaj as the little kid Dhruv brings innocence to the film. He is delightful.</p>

<p>Emraan Hashmi is terrific as Raghu Khanna. He totally gets into the skin of his character, of a shrewd film producer.<br />

<p>Huma Qureshi as Rani Bharti is great. She fits the bill as a strong-headed woman looking to avenge her husband. She nails the Bihari accent.<br />
Amit Sial as Naveen Kumar is as excellent as he has been through the show of Maharani.<br />

<p>Maharani 3 builds on the legacy of Maharani. There are a lot of things to appreciate about the third season of Maharani, despite the fact that it can&#39;t really top the drama of the first couple of seasons, primarily due to the high standards that they have set.<br />

<p>The biggest factor that acted as a buzzkill in the film was its VFX and CGI. The VFX often seemed like video games, something that hinders the viewing experience of an emotionally charged patriotic story that is based on real life events. Although the apparent visibility of VFX reduces over time, or rather, can more easily be ignored due to the engaging story, it still acts as a pebble in one&rsquo;s shoes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the non-syncing dubbing can also be something that takes away the audience&#39;s attention from the action on screen. There were several scenes where dialogues could be heard, even after the character had stopped speaking. Apart from taking the audience&rsquo;s attention away, the non-syncing dubbing also made the dialogues seem unnatural and forced, making it prominent that they were written, rather than the characters speaking it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The romantic angle between Varun Tej and Manushi Chhillar&rsquo;s characters seems to taper off towards the end as well. Their love story starts off well, however, there seems to be no evident payoff, leaving the audience wanting for more. While the filmmaker did not completely abandon the romantic angle, it seems to taper off, seeming to be something more platonic towards the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, one small nitpick that one might have is the slight lag that the film has in the first half, building up to the Pulwama attacks. The Hitchcockian-bomb theory has been stretched for too long that one tends to lose their attention at a point of time. The film could have afforded to be 10-15 minutes shorter, which would have made it more crisp as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Operation Valentine</strong></h3>

<p>Undeniably, the factor that stands out the most in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/operation-valentine">Operation Valentine </a>is the performances, especially that of Varun Tej and Manushi Chhillar. It wouldn&rsquo;t be far-fetched to say that the duo have delivered their career best performances as well.</p>

<p>Apart from the two lead actors, most of the supporting actors have done an excellent job in essaying the characters. The actors essayed their characters to perfection, carrying out their roles in the film.</p>

<p>However, there were certain characters who seemed to have overdone their parts, making them look rather cartoonish in a highly patriotic film. Nonetheless, it does not hinder the viewing experience of the audience.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Operation Valentine</strong></h3>

<p>Despite its flaws, there is no denying that Operation Valentine is a successful aerial entertainer. The film has its moments where it manages to generate goosebumps, but also has buzzkills that carry on throughout the film. Everything said, Operation Valentine does guarantee a fun, enjoyable watch that one could catch with their friends or family.</p>

<p>Satish Kaushik as the civilian who loses his daughter due to the on-road protests is in total control of his craft, even in his last film. Darshan Kumaar as Uday plays his strong-headed character well. He looks very sharp in the military portions towards the end of the film. Anupam Kher as advocate Rajnarayan Singh is ever-so-dependable. There is nothing that he can&#39;t do. Other supporting characters like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/neena-gupta">Neena Gupta</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/smriti-kalra">Smriti Kalra</a> are let down by poor writing that offers them nothing.</p>

<h2 id="66e812665e6d8"><strong>Final Verdict of Kaagaz 2:</strong></h2>

<p>Kaagaz 2 does highlight an important concern that civilians face. However, the film&#39;s shoddy writing and execution never allows it to take the necessary flight. Those who wish to watch Satish Kaushik in his final appearance or wish to know more about the inconvenience caused by on-road rallies and protests can give the film a try. Kaagaz 2 plays at a theatre near you from the 1st of March, 2024.</p>

<p>One has to nitpick to find fault in a film like Manjummel Boys. The film is without a doubt one of the top films to come out so far in 2024. However, taking the film as the film alone, there is a possibility that one feels the second half is a bit cliched, having scenes that have already been shown before in other survival thrillers like Tovino Thomas&rsquo; 2018 or Fahadh Faasil&rsquo;s Malayankunju. Nonetheless, that is only when the film is taken as the film alone. When it is taken into consideration that the film is based on a true story, and is essentially telling the story of exactly what perspired, it makes sense why the makers chose what they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The performances in Manjummel Boys</strong></h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, there are no protagonists in Manjummel Boys. The film tells the story of 11 friends, with all of them being equally important, and having a prominent role to play in the film. While Soubin Shahir and Sreenath Bhasi have the space to shine through, other actors like Jean Paul Lal, Chandu Salimkumar, Balu Varghese, Khalid Rahman, Ganapathi S Poduval, Abhiram Radhakrishnan, Deepak Parambol, and more have executed their roles to perfection. Chandu Salim Kumar&rsquo;s character deserves a special mention as well, pulling off one of the most intricate characters in the film with effortless ease.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Manjummel Boys</strong></h3>

<p>Undeniably, Manjummel Boys is one of the finest additions to Malayalam survival thriller films. The film demands a theater watch with the best sound quality for the best experience, and is sure to leave the audience shook. The film ropes in the viewers, and takes them on a journey with the 11 friends to Kodaikanal, showing the ups and downs in their journey convincingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Manjummel Boys promises to bring, hold, and leave the audience at the edge of their seats, with their hearts beating heavily against their chest. Oh, and Sushin Shyam was right. Manjummel will definitely be a milestone in Malayalam cinema.</p>

Meera Deosthale and Zaan Khan take the reins of this thought-provoking journey that challenges conventions, and the first few episodes have left us wanting to know more about the protagonist, Nandini, and her courageous journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The opening scene, set against the vibrant backdrop of Upleta, Gujarat, introduces us to Nandini, a spirited woman portrayed with grace by Meera Deosthale. Her selfless act of selling her jewelry to save her family&#39;s land immediately establishes her as a woman of substance. Simultaneously, the narrative takes an intriguing turn with the arrival of Naren (Zaan Khan), as he broaches the topic of dowry during a prospective alliance with Nandini&#39;s friend Vishakha, sparking an immediate clash. A dialogue that became my personal favorite from the very first episode is, <em>&quot;Barabari ka zamana hai, toh len-den bhi Barabari ki honi chahiye.&quot; </em>Insinuating that if the boy&#39;s family wants to take Dahej, they should be equally willing to give it back to the girl&#39;s family. This resounding perspective on dowry is fresh and interesting to watch, paired with power-packed dialogues that keep you engaged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This conflict becomes the heartbeat of the narrative, unravelling the harsh realities of the prevailing dowry system. As seen in the show&rsquo;s promos, Nandini&#39;s unapologetic demand for her dowry back challenges the status quo and is a bold statement against the kureets that hurt the dignity of women. Positioning her as a symbol of strength and navigating seamlessly between tradition and modernity, it showcases an aspiring woman rooted in values with an unwavering defiance against age-old beliefs. As opposed to the traditional trope of women portrayed over time who are either silent victims glorified in the name of the &quot;ideal girl&quot; or are categorized as outspoken &quot;modern villains&quot;, Nandini is like a breath of fresh air and is a character that seems real and relatable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the first episode unfolds, Naren&#39;s character emerges as a forward-looking yet seemingly flawed lead, making it another unusual yet curious twist. The show&#39;s potential lies in the promise of character growth, and we&#39;re hoping to see more of Naren and how he and Nandini come together, offering a blend of drama and development.</p>

<p>Kuch Reet Jagat Ki Aisi Hai&quot; serves as a mirror to societal evils, encouraging viewers to question and challenge norms. It adeptly intertwines elements of tradition with a mix of social awareness, romance, and strong character portrayals, which are poised to hook audiences. The engaging plot and pertinent themes make it a worthwhile start. As the story unfolds, it promises to deliver both entertainment and thought-provoking commentary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Airing on Sony Entertainment Television, it earns a commendable 3.5/5 rating.</strong></p>

<h2 id="65ce1a7507cee"><strong>Final Verdict of Bob Marley: One Love</strong></h2>

<p>Bob Marley: One Love is a credible biopic of the music sensation Bob Marley. However, it has structural issues and also gets slow in the middle portions, which don&#39;t allow it to remain a cut above other biopics and dramas on musicians.<br />

<p>Bramayugam stands out as a cinematic masterpiece, blending captivating storytelling with visual splendor to mesmerize audiences throughout. A strong, well-written screenplay is the backbone of this modern-day classic. Writer Rahul Sadasivan&#39;s fusion of folklore storytelling and socio-political intricacies prove&nbsp;to be game-changing for this movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TD Ramakrishnan, known for his epic folktale novels like Francis Ittikora, brings his expertise to the dialogues of this movie, contributing to its success.</p>

<p>Rahul Sadasivan&#39;s direction, along with Shehnad Jalal&#39;s visuals, has added layers of depth to the narrative, reminiscent of the unique style seen in films like Tumbbad. The decision to use black and white grading for visual aesthetics is intriguing and likely added to the film&#39;s overall impact.</p>

<p>Sound mixing and Christo Xavier&#39;s music elevated the viewing experience even further, immersing the audience in the world of the film. With actors like Mammootty delivering stellar performances, Bramayugam truly seems like a standout in the Malayalam industry, carving its path as a classic. It&#39;s exciting to see such innovative storytelling and filmmaking techniques being embraced in Indian cinema.</p>

<h3 id="66e80a4a6a49e"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Bramayugam?</strong></h3>

<p>Bramayugam stands out as a film with minimal flaws, offering a compelling viewing experience overall. While there are a few graphic scenes that may unsettle some viewers, particularly those averse to such content, the decision to utilize a black-and-white screen effectively diminishes the impact of the gore, making it more palatable for a wider audience.</p>

<h3 id="66e80a4a6a4a4"><strong>Performances in Bramayugam</strong></h3>

<p>Mammootty&#39;s portrayal of Koduman Potty in Bramayugam truly exemplifies why he is regarded as a patriarch of acting, as noted by writer Murali Gopi. Despite his extensive career spanning over 50 years and 450+ movies, Mammootty brings a fresh and dynamic dimension to his character, showcasing his versatility and mastery of the craft. His depiction of the villainous antihero serves as the soul of the film, cementing his status as one of the industry&#39;s finest talents.</p>

<p>Moreover, Arjun Ashokan and Sidharth Bharathan deliver standout performances, showcasing their range and depth as actors. Arjun&#39;s portrayal of the courtroom singer (Paanan) is particularly noteworthy, while Sidharth navigates the complexities of his character with finesse, doing justice to the multifaceted role.</p>

<p>Although Amalda Liz and Manikandan Achari have limited screen time, they make a notable impact with their performances, further contributing to the richness of the film&#39;s ensemble cast.</p>

<h3 id="66e80a4a6a4a8"><strong>Verdict of Bramayugam&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bramayugam stands out as a cinematic gem that transcends the typical horror genre. With a captivating blend of mystery, drama, and the rich mythical folklore of Kerala, it offers a compelling narrative that captivates audiences. The film&#39;s masterful craftsmanship and strong storyline, coupled with its exploration of socio-political elements, make it a must-watch in theaters. Bramayugam is a clear winner.</p>

<p>Premalu stands out for its portrayal of relatable life situations, struggles, friendships, and humor that resonate with today&#39;s youth. The dynamic duo of Naslen and Sangeeth delivers an outstanding performance, bringing loads of laughter to the audience, particularly in theater settings. Gireesh AD and Kiran Josey&#39;s dialogue-writing is on point, with each joke landing effortlessly with the viewers. This movie cleverly incorporates references to popular movies and current social media trends, all of which resonate strongly with the audience.&nbsp;Vishnu Vijay&#39;s music and score add another layer of brilliance to the film, enhancing many emotional sequences and elevating the overall experience. The movie also marks the return of veteran singer KG Markose, who lends his voice to a song, adding nostalgic charm to the soundtrack. Ajmal Sabu&#39;s visuals beautifully capture the essence of Hyderabad, a location not commonly seen in Malayalam cinema, adding to the film&#39;s visual appeal.</p>

<h2 id="660bace74f1b0"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Premalu?</strong></h2>

<p>Premalu lives up to its promise of delivering entertainment, and as such, there are a few negatives to highlight. The movie successfully fulfils its purpose of providing a joyful and engaging experience for the audience, meeting the expectations set for it.</p>

<h3 id="660bace74f1b4"><strong>Performances in Premalu&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Naslen truly shines as the heart and soul of Premalu. His portrayal of Sachin, a character deeply relatable to audiences, harks back to the boy-next-door roles popularized by actors like Dilieep in the 90s. Naslen&#39;s on-screen chemistry with both Sangeeth and Mamitha is palpable and contributes significantly to the film&#39;s charm. Mamitha impressively embodies the character of Reenu, effortlessly shedding the traits of Super Sharanya from Girish AD&#39;s previous work to deliver a convincing portrayal of a modern city girl. Sangeeth Prathap&#39;s strong performance, coupled with his impeccable comic timing, adds depth and humor to the film. Shyam Mohan&#39;s portrayal of Adhi is equally commendable, rounding out the cast with his compelling performance.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="660bace74f1d6"><strong>Verdict of Premalu&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Premalu undoubtedly marks Girish AD&#39;s finest work since Thanneermathan Dinangal. If you&#39;re looking to escape from the stresses of life for two and a half hours and immerse yourself in laughter and enjoyment, then look no further&mdash;booking a ticket for Premalu is the perfect choice.</p>

<p>Anweshippin Kandethum exhibits a tale of two halves, where the promise of the initial moments gives way to a disjointed narrative trajectory. While Darwin Kuriakose&#39;s direction and Tovino Thomas&#39;s compelling portrayal inject vitality into the film, Jinu Abraham&#39;s script fails to sustain the momentum established in the first act. The story initially captivates with a strong setup and intriguing premise, but as the plot unfolds, it becomes apparent that the script lacks the necessary cohesion to seamlessly weave together its various elements.</p>

<p>As the narrative progresses, the once-promising storyline loses its grip, with the second half suffering from a noticeable dearth of suspense and a sluggish pace. Despite moments of intrigue, the overall impact of the film is diminished by the script&#39;s inability to maintain tension and momentum throughout. While Darwin Kuriakose&#39;s adept direction and Tovino&#39;s engaging performance manage to salvage some semblance of engagement, the weaknesses in the screenplay ultimately hinder the film&#39;s ability to fully captivate its audience.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Anweshippin Kandethum&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/tovino-thomas">Tovino Thomas </a>delivers a commanding performance in Anweshippin Kandethum, bringing the character of Anand Narayanan to life with remarkable depth and substance. His portrayal is marked by a perfect blend of physical presence and nuanced acting, which truly embodies the essence of the character. Through subtle gestures and expressions, Tovino captures the complexities of Anand Narayanan, making him a compelling and relatable protagonist.</p>

<p>Supporting Tovino&#39;s stellar performance is Vineeth Thattil, who impresses as Tovino&#39;s subordinate. Vineeth Thattil brings sincerity and authenticity to his role, effectively complementing Tovino Thomas&#39;s portrayal and adding depth to their on-screen dynamic. Additionally, Pramod Veliyanad delivers a noteworthy performance as Tovino&#39;s right-hand man. Veliyanad&#39;s portrayal adds a layer of humor and lightness to the narrative, providing moments of comic relief amidst the tension.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Anweshippin Kandethum&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Anweshippin Kandethum offers a decent crime investigation drama with a focus on realism rather than high-octane thrills. This movie is a good watch for the genre lovers. The slow-paced narrative may appeal to those who appreciate detailed and realistic investigations over fast-paced action. However, what truly elevates the film is its brilliant technical aspects and exceptional art direction.</p>

<p>Viewers can thoroughly enjoy Anweshippin Kandethum as a theatrical experience, thanks to its immersive visuals and meticulous attention to detail.</p>

<p>While telling a socio-political story, it is quite important to not sound preachy to the audience, and that is where <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/lal-salaam">Lal Salaam </a>fails. There were several scenes where the dialogues preached moral values, which act&nbsp;as a buzzkill while watching the film,</p>

<p>Additionally, Aishwarya Rajinikanth&#39;s attempt to adopt a non-linear narrative style adds to the confusion in the middle of the film. The story jumps back and forth between the past and the present, making it challenging to keep up with during the first half. However, as the film progresses, everything starts to make sense and come together by the end. Nevertheless, the audience is left to piece together the puzzle by themselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, the movie becomes rather predictable, particularly towards the conclusion, as if the scene has been repeated countless times before. The ending feels rushed, and the characters would have benefited from a more satisfying outcome.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the music in the movie kind of ruins the vibe, making it feel disconnected from the story unfolding on the screen. Additionally, it seemed like the creators of Lal Salaam had a lot to express, with well-crafted characters and a compelling storyline. However, there was a lack of effective communication.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Lal Salaam</strong></h3>

<p>No doubt about it, the performances steal the show in Lal Salaam. Thiru, played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/vishnu-vishal">Vishnu Vishal</a>, goes through a whirlwind of emotions and the actor effortlessly portrays them. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/vikranth">Vikranth</a>, as Samsu, also has a well-developed character with a range of emotions, from anger to calmness to angst, at different points in the story.</p>

<p>The performances by Senthil and KS Ravikumar also deserve a special mention. In fact, there is an entire sequence where Senthil&rsquo;s performance is sure to bring tears to anyone&rsquo;s eyes. Senthil&rsquo;s performance was not just realistic, but also quite relatable. Furthermore, Vivek Prasanna has done a fantastic role as the film&#39;s prime antagonist as well.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/rajinikanth">Rajinikanth </a>easily stole the show with his performance as Moideen Bhai. The veteran actor shone through, bringing the swag and suave that is inherent in him. Further, Aishwarya Rajinikanth has been able to showcase the emotional side of Rajinikanth&rsquo;s character, further making the character more relatable. The ease with which Rajinikanth pulls off the action sequences, as well as the way he brings the character of Moideen Bhai to life, is proof of why he is still the Superstar of Kollywood.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Lal Salaam</strong></h3>

<p>Despite all its flaws, Lal Salaam is definitely worth a watch. The film never lags even for a second, and carries the audience through a wonderful journey, telling a tale that is quite relevant especially today. Aishwarya Rajinikanth puts forth an important theme - Humanity transcends all differences - in quite an entertaining manner. The use of sports to tell a political tale has seldom been done before, and Aishwarya Rajinikanth pulls it off quite convincingly.</p>

<p>The biggest issue one would face while watching Malaikottai Vaaliban is the extensive runtime. Right from the first scene, the film follows a rather slow pace, which is maintained throughout the film. Although there is a slight increase in pace in the second half, it quickly goes back to the slow pace, lagged experience. The relatively slow pace can sometimes be a bit overbearing for the audience as well. What adds to the slow pace of the film is the extensive use of slow motion in the editing as well.</p>

<p>Something that deserves to be mentioned along with the slow pace of the film is its writing. While the idea of Malaikottai Vaaliban as a film, and the incidents that take place in it are quite solid, the journey from one incident to the next seems to be quite haphazard. Further, it has not been established well enough that the film falls under the fantasy action genre, leading to quite the confusion when certain action sequences take place. While the story as an idea works, its translation to the script seems half-baked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A factor that does deserve appreciation is that the film does not stop right after the emotionally charged, high-octane action sequence in the second half, and the characters go back to their daily livelihood, as one would expect fairy tales to end. One &lsquo;once upon a time&rsquo; can always be followed up by another. However, Lijo Jose Pellissery takes too long to elaborate on why the film is still going on.</p>

<h3><strong>The Performances in Malaikottai Vaaliban</strong></h3>

<p>Undoubtedly, it is one of Mohanlal&rsquo;s best on-screen performances in recent times. The actor brings the character of Malaikottai Vaaliban to life and in a seemingly believable manner. Further, the supporting cast including Hareesh Peradi, Manoj Moses, and Katha Nandi all deserve praise as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/sonalee-kulkarni">Sonalee Kulkarni </a>was quite impeccable for most parts, however, there is one scene in particular where it feels she has overdone. Nonetheless, that scene does not discredit her brilliant performance in other scenes. Danish Sait, in his Malayalam debut, does justice to his character of Chamathakan, the maniacal antagonist. There is a thin line between being maniacal and overacting, and Danish manages to walk the line with precision for most parts of the film. However, there are parts where he overdoes it as well.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict of Malaikottai Vaaliban</strong></h3>

<p>In an interview prior to the film&rsquo;s release, Mohanlal mentioned that Malaikottai Vaaliban is a one-of-a-kind film, which has rarely been attempted in India. The statement holds true. Malaikottai Valiban is indeed a bold attempt in the fantasy genre by Lijo Jose Pellissery, a director known to keep experimenting with his films. The film does bring a fable-esque scenario to life and convincingly portrays the valiant fairy tale of the titular warrior. Despite its flaws, Malaikottai Vaaliban is worth watching in theaters, especially for Madhu Neelakandan&rsquo;s cinematography and Prashant Pillai&rsquo;s music.</p>

<p>Ravi Jadhav&rsquo;s Main Atal Hoon narrates the inspiring story of India&rsquo;s Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, played by Pankaj Tripathi. From his younger days in Gwalior to becoming the country&rsquo;s Prime Minister, the movie chronicles many ups and downs from his life in this two hour and nineteen minutes narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What works?</strong></p>

<p>It is Pankaj Tripathi&rsquo;s stand out performance that salvages the rather monotonous screenplay of Main Atal Hoon. His chemistry in some of the initial scenes with Piyush Mishra truly stand out, and some of his speech sequences including the one set in the Ramlila Maidan are the high points of the film. These sequences are ably supported by an impactful background score composed by Monty Sharma.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the film opens on an interesting note, but then soon gets lost amidst a series of anecdotes, which not only impacts the screenplay from a story point of view, but also the pace of the narrative. The film does slightly pick up in the second half but still with an uneven graph of storytelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Production designer Sandeep Ravade&rsquo;s work is in sync with the story, while Sachin Lovalekar&rsquo;s costume styling is on point, and so is Kavish Sinha&rsquo;s casting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It is the cluttered screenplay written by Rishi Virmani and Ravi Jadhav, and poorly executed by the latter which is a major letdown of Main Atal Hoon. The makers have tried to add a lot of anecdotes from Atal Bihari Vajpayee&rsquo;s life with obviously the right intent to highlight as many of his significant contributions and sacrifices, but in doing so they have ripped apart the soul of the narrative, thus barring the audience from emotionally connecting to the story. Besides the weak writing, editor Bunty Nagi also fails to save the movie on the editing table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawrence DCunha&rsquo;s cinematography is underwhelming, and so is Salim - Sulaiman, Payal Dev, Kailash Kher and Amitraj&rsquo;s music. Lighting in some of the close up scenes is also not up to the mark.</p>

<p>The climax as well is rushed, and once again just ends up being anecdotal minus any impact, almost like we usually see in a documentary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Pankaj Tripathi is extraordinary as Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and it is true that probably no one could have played the part better than him. Piyush Mishra in his limited screen time will steal your hearts (like he always does with his performances). Raja Rameshkumar Sevak as LK Advani and Payal Nair as Indira Gandhi have lived up to their parts, and so have the rest of the supporting cast.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Pankaj Tripathi&rsquo;s Ravi Jadhav directed Main Atal Hoon fails to do justice to a truly inspiring journey.</p>

<p>Although <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/ayalaan">Ayalaan</a> does have its fair share of flaws, it gets the important things right. For a movie that is heavily dependent on VFX and CGI, it does not have any glaring flaws. Yes, there are minute issues in one or two frames, but the remaining portions are error-free. Like for example, the alien fits in very well within the world of the film. Even the spaceship and the villain&rsquo;s ultra-advanced lair are well rendered. Of course, it would be unrealistic to expect Hollywood-level standards from a relatively low-budget Tamil movie, so keep your expectations in check while watching the film.</p>

<p>Another important aspect that Ayaalan gets right is, it has its heart in the right place. The emotions and the drama work well within the story. Especially the emotional track between Tamizh and the alien strikes a chord with you. Ayalaan makes you root for the two central characters, even making you a tad bit emotional at the end. It also helps that actor Siddharth has dubbed for the alien as there is a certain familiarity and innocence in Siddharth&rsquo;s voice that makes you connect with the character.</p>

<p>Even the comedy in the film fits in pretty organically, thanks to Yogi Babu&rsquo;s eternal comedy timing. Give the man any scene and he can make you laugh. Even Karunakaran manages to generate a few laughs.</p>

<h3><strong>What does not work in Ayaalan:</strong></h3>

<p>If Ayaalan was released a few years ago, as it ideally should have been, maybe this would not have been such a big issue but unfortunately, the outdated screenplay sticks out like a sore thumb. The songs are placed very randomly, disturbing the natural flow of proceedings and some portions, especially a few dialogues feel very outdated.</p>

<p>The film also starts off in a very odd fashion, with characters behaving very oddly and the only real VFX issues are also present in these portions. Although the film manages to steer to safety pretty quickly after that, it does end up losing steam after a point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ideas are still impressive on paper, but the execution falters majorly, especially in the second half. It feels as if the second half is getting dragged on for way too long and the scenes start to feel very repetitive.</p>

<p>There is also a love track between Sivakarthikeyan and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/rakul-preet-singh">Rakul Preet Singh</a> in the movie which does move the plot forward in a way, but the lackluster writing in these portions, makes us feel disconnected with their pairing. There was more love between Siva Karthikeyan and the alien.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ayalaan offers interesting potential with the presence of essentially two heroes, one is Tamizh and the other is the alien. So, a strong villain would have amped up the drama to a large extent but this is where Ayalaan majorly falters. Neither does Dev, played by an efficient Sharad Kelkar, feel menacing nor does he have a strong back story. His character feels one note and does not generate enough intrigue.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Ayaalan:</strong></h3>

<p>It is hard to critique the performances in Ayaalan because Sivakarthikeyan and the alien carry out the major exploits in the film. The rest of the supporting cast are there for a few laughs and that&rsquo;s about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sivakarthikeyan puts in a good shift as Tamizh. This blend of comedy and action is nothing new for the actor and he pulls it off with relative ease. Rakul Preet Singh doesn&#39;t get to flex her acting muscles much and Sharad Kelkar does a decent job of playing a generic villain character.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Ayaalan:</strong></h3>

<p>Ayaalan is an admirable project from R Ravikumar. His vision is colossal but unfortunately, his ideas falter from outdated bumps in the screenplay. However, Ayaalan is definitely not a film to be dismissed completely. It gets its emotions and drama right and ultimately makes us root for the alien, and for that at least, Ayaalan is a success. As an adult, it might not make for an extremely enjoyable performance but children are sure to love the heck out of it.</p>

<p>Everything said, Captain Miller is not free from flaws however minimal they are. The first half, although it sets the premise for the film perfectly, might feel a bit dragged out in places. However, the film completely takes off, in the second half, and even leaves the audience wanting more. That being said, it is important to mention the first half is slow only in comparison to the second half, and in no way takes away the cinematic spectacle that Captain Miller is.</p>

<p>At the time of censor certification, it was revealed that the makers were asked to trim down 4 minutes from the action sequence in the film&rsquo;s climax. While watching it in the theaters, the sequence plays out so well that one is left wondering about the trimmed-down minutes, wishing they could get a glimpse. It can only be hoped that the makers figure out a way to put it out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Captain Miller</strong></h3>

<p>With a star cast including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/dhanush">Dhanush</a>, Shiva Rajkumar, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/sundeep-kishan">Sundeep Kishan</a>, Priyanka Mohan, Aditi Balan, Vinoth Kishan, Nassar, John Kokken, Edward Sonnenblick, and many many more, the expectations are sky high even before one walks into the theater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, it has been delivered perfectly by the actors, bringing each character to life. As mentioned earlier, the characters are driven by their personal motives and struggles, which means that their actions and reactions are quite different as well. Each actor has given their 100%, helping transport the viewer to the world of Captain Miller.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dhanush and Shiva Rajkumar&rsquo;s chemistry, as well as the former&rsquo;s chemistry with Priyanka Mohan deserves a special mention. Despite strained relationships and several misunderstandings, they are forced to interact due to circumstances, which the actors have done phenomenally.</p>

<p>Additionally, John Kokken and Edward Sonnenblick&#39;s performances as the antagonists deserve a special mention as well. The actors make sure that the characters are despised by the audience, as intended by the filmmaker. It wouldn&#39;t be far-fetched to say John Kokken&#39;s Rajathipathi is quite reminiscent of Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s Calvin Candie from Quentin Tarantino&#39;s 2012 film Django Unchained.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Captain Miller</strong></h3>

<p>Captain Miller is one such example where the story that is written on paper is brought to life and transports the audience to the world in which it is happening. The film deserves a watch in the theaters and is sure to give the audience a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and goosebumps. The film also promises to give fans food for thought, as well as leave them wanting more, which is sure to be delivered when the film&rsquo;s sequel comes out.</p>

<p>Mahesh Babu is by far the highest advantage for the film. The film peaks in most points over the impeccable nature of Mahesh&#39;s charm and charismatic energy which fills up the screens in whatsoever scenes he appears. The swag he presumes is a big reason for the film&#39;s entertainment factor.</p>

<p>The film is what everyone would expect after watching the trailer and considering Trivikram Srinivas is helming the project. A family entertainer film that is packed with mass moments and a contending relationship between a son and his deserted mother. The film packs a whole lot of emotion which rides on these two characters and how they find their way to each other.</p>

<p>Trivikram Srinivas and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/mahesh-babu">Mahesh Babu</a> joining hands once again with a family entertainer like this is a treat for fans with the superstar carving out every mass moments and dance scene with full-on flair and vibrance. The intro sequence of the film itself showcasing a rugged Mahesh is whistle-worthy which makes the following dance number for the song Dum Masala all the more fun to watch.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the song also serves as an ode to the late superstar Krishna, with his son dancing in front of his cutouts.</p>

<p>All the more, the film Guntur Kaaram is essentially a film made with keeping in mind to satiate the die-hard fans of Mahesh Babu who are seeing him after two years on the big screen.</p>

<p>Along with Mahesh Babu, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/ramya-krishnan">Ramya Krishnan</a> plays a dominating mother in the film with Prakash Raj being a formidable antagonist. Though the screen time was low for Jayaram, the actor gave his best playing the role of the protagonist&rsquo;s father. Moreover, the comedic gags of Vennela Kishore do work standing as a relief from time to time.</p>

<p>The technical side of the film has to be praised for Manoj Paramahamsa who has done his iconic style of yellowish lighting in the frames along with the long drawn aerial drone shots and 360&deg; shots that elevate the mass moments in the film.</p>

<p>Adding to this, Keralites might feel a slight resemblance to the left eye damage and the problematic relationship the son and mother have with the 2005 Malayalam film Rajamanikyam but that is where the resemblance ends with Mahesh Babu making this his own.</p>

<h3><strong>The Bad in Guntur Kaaram:</strong></h3>

<p>Coming to the bad in Guntur Kaaram, the leading ladies Sreeleela and Meenakshii Chaudhary add nothing of value to these scenes besides the occasional side-eye looks and dance numbers one of them has. While Sreeleela becomes the primary love interest of the hero with constant gasps of awe at the hero&rsquo;s antics to the cringe-worthy expressions in unnecessary situations prevail in this film, similar to most of her previous films.</p>

<p>The second leading lady Meenakshii Chaudhary though possessing a better acting range was limited to staying in the shadows with occasional glimpses of her character coming and going as if annoyed by her cousin. But she had more time on the screen than Jagapathi Babu who felt so out of place in this film, playing an unnecessary character from the very start. Additionally, a scene where Sreeleela is being compared to Okkadu heroine Bhumika felt out of taste and can be a bit problematic when viewed through a contemporary setting.</p>

<p>The first half presented a lot of mass moments and ear-bangers with exhilarating action sequences but was also stuffed with many dragged-out scenes. The second half though was more concise in presenting the main plot of the film without deviating into unnecessary tropes of commercial cinema.</p>

<p>The technical side of editing did feel lacking on several occasions with a choppy feel here and there. Along with that S Thaman did a formidable job with bangers like Dum Masala and Kurchi Madathapetti with a few background scores hitting hard but by far this is not the composer&rsquo;s best work nor his worst.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Guntur Kaaram:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/guntur-kaaram">Guntur Kaaram</a> is worth watching for family audiences in theaters for Sankranti this year with Mahesh Babu presenting a soft-baked movie to a whole another level with his charm and charisma. The film provides a whole new shade in masala movies for Mahesh Babu but this does not qualify close to other Trivikram-Mahesh Babu films like Athadu or Khaleja.</p>

<p>The film is surely a treat for fans and is a festival of sorts for them to enjoy in the theaters until Superstar returns with another film, maybe in a year or two.</p>

Well, a thriller love story - Merry Christmas&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Set in Bombay (now Mumbai), Albert (Vijay Sethupathi) returns to the Maximum City on a Christmas Eve. While attempting to kill his loneliness in a restaurant, he meets Maria (Katrina Kaif), who was abandoned by her date because she brought her daughter along. This is soon followed by a movie outing (probably watching &lsquo;The Adventures of Pinocchio&rsquo;), after which Maria befriends Albert and invites him over to her place. One thing leads to another, and these strangers are trapped in a thrilling night of adventure, risks, and desire. Maybe that&rsquo;s why in the film, and even in the trailer, director Sriram Raghavan highlights on screen - &lsquo;Check your <s>be</s>longings before leaving cinema.&rsquo; Maybe, that was for Albert. Based on Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Dard&rsquo;s Le Monte-charge, watch Merry Christmas to know why I say that&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>In the last few years, I have felt the importance of music has experienced a descending order in cinema, and the significance of background music has been left even far behind. But not for Sriram Raghavan. In all his films, BGM has played an important character, not only for enhancing the impact of the narrative, but also for taking it forward, and the same reflects in Merry Christmas as well. The hero element according to me, and kudos to Daniel B. George for a memorable background score in this thriller love story, showcasing his musical versatility in riveting and in romantic sequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lights and the darkness have been beautifully used to express emotions and occasions, especially in the cinema hall sequence, and at Maria&rsquo;s home where the light of the Christmas tree is switched on first, and is then followed by the overall lights of the living room, thus emphasizing on the mood and occasion around which the movie is set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further lending an important technical support to the overall visuals of Merry Christmas is production designer Mayur Sharma and cinematographer Madhu Neelakandan (ISC), who have impeccably recreated and presented the yesteryear Mumbai, and its homes highlighting the milieu of the characters. My favorite sequence is Maria and Albert shaking a leg in her living room, with the teal coloured floral wallpapers beautifully combined with red curtains in the background, and Neelakandan&rsquo;s wide shot, that does complete justice to the scene, actor&rsquo;s performances, and the background that has its own story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another important element for a film, set in a different time zone than today are the costumes, and Anaita Shroff Adajania and Sabina Haldar have done complete justice to that aspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Goes without saying that all of this has been ably brought together by master storyteller Sriram Raghavan, and his team of writers Arjit Biswas, Pooja Ladha Surti and Anukriti Pandey. The smooth screenplay, combined with subtle yet humorous dialogues, Vijay&rsquo;s matter-of-fact delivery of some really funny lines, Katrina&rsquo;s mysterious play of her character, and Sriram&rsquo;s direction, makes Merry Christmas a delectable watch.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>There are two important elements of a film, where I felt Merry Christmas underplays itself - which is the interval block and the climax of the film. The interval came in too early with a rather lukewarm sequence preceding it, and the climax - well, it was just underwhelming - as a diehard Sriram Raghavan fan I was expecting a little more. I reiterate, the sequences aren&rsquo;t bad, they probably just don&rsquo;t satiate your expectations. I believe this is the only aspect that might not work in the favour of the film.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>One of the hardest things to do as an actor, is to portray subtle emotions while retaining the mystery in extremely emotionally (happy and sad) charged sequences in a suspenseful film, and Katrina Kaif portrays that beautifully in Merry Christmas. Truly a delightful performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vijay Sethupathi is a gifted actor, and probably is the best example of controlled acting. He doesn&rsquo;t go wrong even in one sequence, and lifts up so many by just saying his lines, or that&rsquo;s what it seems like - effortless.</p>

<p>Tinnu Raaj Anand and Sanjay Kapoor have aced their parts, and so have Raghavan&rsquo;s regulars in his movies - Vinay Pathak, Radhika Apte and Ashwini Kalsekar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Sriram Raghavan&rsquo;s Katrina Kaif and Vijay Sethupathi led Merry Christmas has thrill and love at almost the right places. It isn&rsquo;t perfect, but then what is. Go watch the film.</p>

<p>I would have given the film three stars, but I am adding another half just for the electrifying background score.</p>

<p>HanuMan is a well casted film as all the actors &ndash; Teja Sajja, Amirtha Aiyer, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Vinay Rai, Raj Deepak Shetty, Vennela Kishore, Satya, and Getup Srinu &ndash; do well in their respective parts. Given that we watched the film in Hindi, it&rsquo;s unfair to get into the depth of their performances, but we can say with confidence that the dubbing quality of Hanu-Man is at par with some of the biggest blockbusters made in Hindi.</p>

<h2 id="65a03faee9fa6"><strong>Verdict of HanuMan:</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, HanuMan is the first surprise package of 2024 as director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/prasanth-varma">Prasanth Varma</a> brings out his ambition to the big screen with utmost conviction. The film entertains with the right amount of drama, action, comedy, and devotional value. What holds attention apart from the vision of creating something magical is also the non-serious approach to the superhero tale.</p>

<p>Much like Lord Hanuman being in search of a pure-hearted soul to get his superpowers, the audience is always in search of honest filmmakers and will reward Prasanth Varma for this ambitious take on Lord Hanuman in modern times.</p>

<p>While the lead characters delivered commendable performances, Randheer Krishnan&rsquo;s script in Ozler lacked the substance and quality characteristic of his previous works. The direction, too, felt just average this time, with many scenes and sequences appearing reminiscent of other thriller movies in different languages.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Abraham Ozler</strong></h3>

<p>Ozler&#39;s standout feature lies in witnessing Jayaram in a refreshing avatar distinct from his previous roles. His convincing portrayal of an officer battling depression, coupled with the well-crafted character of Ozler, established a strong connection with the audience. Mammootty&#39;s impactful cameo added an extra layer to the movie, while the performances of the new actors in the flashbacks were excellent. Jagadish, at the peak of his career, delivered an impressive performance, and Anaswara, who garnered praise for her role in Mohanlal&#39;s Neru, made a noteworthy cameo in Ozler&#39;s flashback.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Abraham Ozler</strong></h3>

<p>In conclusion, Ozler falls into the category of another half-baked thriller, relying on the performances of the actors and a&nbsp;brilliant original score. If you&#39;re a fan of thrillers and have enjoyed Midhun Manuel Thomas&#39;s previous works, Ozler might provide a decent watch.</p>

<p>Manoj Bajpayee essays his two complex characters, masterfully. He gets out of his zone to play Prabhakar and Umesh and very much succeeds in doing so.<br />

<p>Other prominent characters in the show like Arvind Shetty, Thupalli, Inspector Hassan, Appu, Kirtimaa, Lucas and Mehrunisa are extremely exciting to watch.

<p>Kho Gaye Hum Kahan is a gutsy take on imperfect human relationships in the new age of social media. The film is a fusion of fine writing and mature storytelling.

<p>The biggest drawback of the film is its runtime. The film is an astounding 2 hours and 52 minutes long, with several slow-motion sequences used to amplify the impact the scenes have on the audience. However, this backfires to a certain extent, as several scenes in the film feel dragged out. The sequences sometimes make it seem as if the emotional connection of the scene is being forced upon the audience, while the filmmaker has already done a brilliant job.</p>

<p>Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the film is a retelling of Prashanth Neel&rsquo;s debut film, Ugramm. The initial 15 minutes of the film follow the exact same narrative as the 2014 film, with little to no difference whatsoever. Although it does not harm the film overall, it does act as an irk for someone who has already watched Ugramm. In fact, there are several scenes throughout the film, where Salaar feels like an amalgamation of Ugramm and KGF. The uncanny similarity might even make one wonder if Prashanth Neel is sticking to a given formula for success.</p>

<p>Ravi Basrur&rsquo;s music definitely does its job, complementing a scene perfectly and adding emotional value to it. However, unlike what was seen in the KGF franchise, the music does not elevate the scenes, while it seemed like the film offered the potential to do so. It does its job&mdash;nothing more, nothing less.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything said, it is important to mention that none of these act as a hindrance to the visual experience of Salaar.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The performances in Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire</strong></h3>

<p>Prashanth Neel had mentioned in an interview that a star is a star, and irrespective of how many of their films fail at the box office, one success is enough to bring them back. Salaar is that film for Prabhas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Baahubali actor probably gave his best performance since the SS Rajamouli film. Prabhas&rsquo; character in Devarata, aka Deva, is one with plenty of emotional depth. The character has a heavy backstory, which Prabhas has conveyed perfectly. All actions and motions are calculated and carried out to perfection by the actor. Additionally, the action sequences also deserve a special mention, with the actor successfully giving the audience goosebumps. It would not be an overstatement to mention that Salaar is a Prabhas film, and the actor definitely steals the show.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/prithviraj-sukumaran">Prithviraj Sukumaran&rsquo;s </a>portrayal of Varadharaja Mannar also stood out throughout the film. From what is understood, Varadharaja Mannar is a complicated character who calculates his every move. There is an underlying implication to all his actions, and the character carries that level of maturity in him. Prithviraj brought the character to life, and honestly, once you watch the film, it is quite difficult to imagine anyone else in that role. The chemistry that Prabhas and Prithviraj shared needs to be mentioned separately as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/jagapathi-babu">Jagapathi Babu&rsquo;s </a>portrayal of Raja Mannar, as well as Sriya Reddy&rsquo;s portrayal of Radha Rama Mannar stood out as well. Both actors perfectly essayed the roles they were given, and had an aura of royalty surrounding them, which seems to be an inherent characteristic of their characters.</p>

<p>Shruti Haasan, Easwari Rao, John Vijay, Ramachandra Raju, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/bobby-simha">Bobby Simha </a>and all other supporting actors have done a fantastic job in terms of acting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire can only be described with one word - EPIC. The film has everything that is necessary for a good drama, and on a much broader perspective can be compared to the Mahabharata. Prashanth Neel brings a new world to life, leaving fans wanting for more even at the end of three hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prashanth Neel&rsquo;s Telugu debut is nothing short of a masterpiece, a visual spectacle. The film engages fans with brilliantly choreographed action sequences without losing track of the underlying story and drama. Prithviraj Sukumaran was right when he said that Salaar at its core is a drama. The drama definitely works out, and the filmmaker has hit it out of the park, with the help of his star-studded cast.</p>

<p>Shah Rukh Khan as Hardy is remarkable. He brings charm and charisma to his character. His courtroom monologue is perhaps the best scene in his career spanning across 4 decades. In short, Shah Rukh Khan the actor takes total charge.</p>

<p>Taapsee Pannu is outstanding. The confidence that oozes in her performance is contagious. The character of Manu will shine bright in her already enviable filmography.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/vicky-kaushal">Vicky Kaushal</a> in his extended appearance, confirms that the future of the Indian Film Industry is in safe hands.</p>

<p>Every other supporting actor in the film from Boman Irani to Deven Bhojani, has been utilised masterfully.</p>

<h2 id="65845e1c2bdf2"><strong>Final Verdict Of Dunki:</strong></h2>

<p>Rajkumar Hirani has created an impeccable fusion of his cinema and Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s. The result is Dunki, a film that has the ability to stand the test of time and be regarded as a modern-day classic.</p>

Does this Mohit Raina-led thriller live up to the expectations? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

<h2 id="657c04175477e"><strong>Plot of The Freelancer 2:</strong></h2>

<p>The first part of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/series/the-freelancer">The Freelancer</a></strong> sets up the conflict of how Aliya (Kashmira Pardeshi) is tricked by her own family to get trapped in the war zone &ndash; Syria. The second part of the series is basically based on a rescue mission undertaken by an ex-cop turned mercenary, Avinash Kamath (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/mohit-raina">Mohit Raina</a></strong>), who happens to be the uncle of Aliya. Avinash activates his network of mercenaries and also seeks the help of global intelligence agencies to execute the mission. Does he succeed? Watch Freelancer 2 to know more!</p>

<h2 id="657c041754788"><strong>What works for The Freelancer 2?</strong></h2>

<p>The core conflict of The Freelancer has the elements to keep you on the edge of your seat. The creator, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/neeraj-pandey">Neeraj Pandey</a></strong>, along with director Dhav Dhulia and fellow Writers Ritesh Shah and Shirish Thorat, have strong source material that makes you root for the victory of characters. There are moments, which keep you on the edge of your seat, especially in the final episode.</p>

<p>The series lives up to the expectations created by the cliffhanger of the first part. The performances are nuanced and the narrative is fast-paced. The makers don&rsquo;t drag the conflict for too long and stay true to the genre. The final 30 minutes are nail-biting, whereas there are elements in all the episodes that create the thrilling moments. The BGM is solid and elevates the impact of the narrative. In-fact, it&rsquo;s placed at the right moments to spike curiosity.</p>

<p>There are enough elements in The Freelancer 2 to make for a perfect cinematic feature presentation too, in-fact, it could have been an ideal subject for Baby 2 with Akshay Kumar. The series has a voice of its own, that&#39;s distinct from other espionage content on the digital world like Special Ops and The Family Man.</p>

<h2 id="657c04175478d"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for The Freelancer 2?</strong></h2>

<p>The biggest issue with The Freelancer 2 is the idea of geniuses to split a single-season series into a two-parter. A mission-based thriller is all about getting invested in the world, and it&rsquo;s unfair on anyone&rsquo;s part two purposely split it in two parts for commercial reasons. As a viewer, it always gets difficult to rebuild the emotional conflict and root for the characters all over again. The impact will always be higher when espionage is told in one go.</p>

<p>The logistical part aside, The Freelancer 2 does take a lot of creative liberties and one needs to be invested in the characters to ignore the logical loopholes in some instances. There is an entire sub-track that takes heavy reference from the Tiger Franchise, and it&rsquo;s hard to ignore the similarities. The production values could have been better.</p>

<h2 id="657c041754792"><strong>Performances in The Freelancer 2</strong></h2>

<p>Mohit Raina as Avinash Kamath delivers a credible performance and has an aura and body language that makes you believe in his capability to successfully undertake the rescue mission. Anupam Kher as Dr. Arif has a cameo who mentors Avinash at key junctures of the journey. Kashmira Pardeshi is solid and seems to be a talent to watch out for. Manjari Fadnnis does well in her brief appearance. Navneet Malik has the calm as one of the antagonists and lets the emotion flow off his eyes. The entire series is cast to perfection by the makers.</p>

<h2 id="657c041754796"><strong>Verdict of The Freelancer 2</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, The Freelancer 2 is a well-made espionage thriller that rides on edge-of-the-seat moments, a credible performance, and a well-written story. While suspension of disbelief is needed to delve into this world, the emotions are strong enough for you to root for the protagonist&rsquo;s journey. It&rsquo;s another winner from Neeraj Pandey and Team.</p>

<p><strong>3.5 Stars</strong></p>

<p>Agastya Nanda as Archie Andrews is pretty good. He gives a confident performance and enjoys a solid screen presence. There definitely is potential there.<br />
Khushi Kapoor as Betty Cooper does well and nails the dance routines. However, her character arc is not explored much, which limits her scope as a performer.&nbsp;<br />

<p>The Archies is another masterfully crafted Zoya Akhtar directorial that boasts of some impressive performances by the debutants.

Throughout the campaign, the makers have promised a cinematic experience like never before in this gangster-based action drama. Does Sandeep Reddy Vanga deliver big with Animal? Let&rsquo;s find out</p>

<h2><strong>Plot of Animal:</strong></h2>

<p>After scaling new heights in his family business, Balbir Singh&rsquo;s (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/anil-kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a></strong>) life is in danger from an unknown force. His son, Ranvijay Singh (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/ranbir-kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a></strong>), who is happily living in the US with his wife, Geetanjali (Rashmika Mandanna), returns to India to find the mastermind behind Balbir&rsquo;s life. The rage for revenge is at its peak, as Ranvijay sees this as an opportunity to finally win over the love and get due attention from his father. Who is the mastermind? Why is he behind Balbir&rsquo;s life? Is Ranvijay able to save his father? All this and much more unfolds in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/animal">Animal</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What works for Animal?</strong></h2>

<p>First things first, Animal is an out-and-out Ranbir Kapoor show. It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine Ranbir in this larger-than-life avatar, but the actor surpasses all expectations to deliver a performance that will be remembered for decades to come by. He carries the film on his shoulders, as there are sequences where he emotes through his eyes, and then there are blocks where the body language does the talking. His performance as Ranvijay Singh aka. Animal is the biggest plus of this gangster-based action drama.</p>

<p>The first half of Animal flies off in no time as Sandeep Reddy Vanga grips you into the world from the first scene. One is eager to see how the character of Ranbir evolves upon seeing the threat to his father&rsquo;s life. And Vanga manages to keep interest intact all through the prolonged first half. His storytelling is unconventional with multiple cuts &ndash; from a certain scene to the other, from flashback to present, from one plot point to the other &ndash; but it all comes together in the first half.</p>

<p>Some of the best moments of the film come in the first half &ndash; be it Ranbir&rsquo;s introduction, his first meeting with Rashmika, the entire dramatic chunk at Anil Kapoor&rsquo;s 60th birthday, the gun sequence in the college, and the prolonged action-packed interval block. You step out of the hall in the interval preparing yourself for an even bigger explosion in the latter half of the film &ndash; as Animal comes across as a rounded film with a story that holds attention and performances that elevate. And thankfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;The film has some solid moments in the second half too, which includes the climax fight sequence and the confrontation of RK and Anil. The placement of Satranga in the second half also comes at a tender moment.</p>

<p>Another strength of Animal is the background score &ndash; it hits you differently with the Dolby sound system. The music of Animal works very well in the narrative and the producer, Bhushan Kumar gives the film the right scale and production values.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Animal?</strong></h2>

<p>While Sandeep sets up the plot for a big conflict till the interval, the second half is relatively slow. The makers could have trimmed a lot of the plot points in the second half and skipped faster to the climax. The entire change in the dynamic of Ranbir and Rashmika seems out of place and Vanga stretches it too far with his writing of women in the film, which might make most of the female audiences (even male) uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bobby Deol is underutilized and his track is not cooked up well. The limited screen presence also dilutes the emotional sub-track between RK and Bobby. The entire build-up of Animal is about finding the killer, but the audience already knows who it is due to the presence of Bobby in the trailer. The impact might have been different had the makers cast some lesser-known actor for the part, and not shown the same in the trailer.</p>

<p>The inter-character dynamics, which flow seamlessly in the first half, start to appear forced in the second. The editing could have been a lot better, and this 3-hour 21-minute saga could have easily been cut down to a hard-hitting 2-hour 50-minute drama.</p>

<h2><strong>Performances in Animal</strong></h2>

<p>Animal is an out-and-out Ranbir Kapoor show as despite the disjoined second half, it&rsquo;s Ranbir Kapoor who keeps your attention intact through his performance. From the first frame till the last, he gets the chance to display a series of emotions through the metamorphosis of character. This is easily his greatest performance to date and can be a showreel of character study for the next generation of actors. He brings in the aura and demeanour that&rsquo;s needed for a larger-than-life character like this &ndash; be it in his walk, swag, or the action sequences &ndash; Ranbir Kapoor is a giant force to reckon with. Watch out for the prolonged role-play sequence with Anil towards the end &ndash; it&rsquo;s probably the greatest dramatic performance-driven sequence we have seen in a long long time.</p>

<p>Anil Kapoor as Balbir Singh is excellent and does well in playing the ignorant father to evoke extreme reactions from his son. He maintains a calm through his actions in the film, and underplaying the part is something that only a seasoned actor like Anil Kapoor could do. Rashmika Madanna is fine on her part and peaks with her performance in the emotional outburst in the second half. Bobby Deol has a cameo and one wished for more of him. With this screen time, the makers should have given hopes of an epic battle royale between RK and Bobby. He is however good in the limited that he gets to do. Shakti Kapoor and Prem Chopra have limited roles and do well in their parts. Tritpi Dimri does well in her extended cameo. The rest of the supporting cast do well in their respective role.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict of Animal</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, Animal makes for a solid watch, that rides on a fast-paced first half and a decent&nbsp;second with Ranbir Kapoor delivering&nbsp;the performance of his lifetime. Animal certainly has enough moments to sail through with a big number at the box office on support of Youth &amp; Masses, though families and women might stay away from it after the initial euphoria. Watch it for Ranbir Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor, and Ranbir Kapoor, alongside the high octane fast-paced first half.</p>

<p>As specified above, Vicky Kaushal delivers one of the best performances by a mainstream actor in recent times. He is a performer who needs to be protected at all costs; Someone who deserves to get film scripts that match his calibre. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/sanya-malhotra">Sanya Malhotra</a> as Sam&#39;s wife Siloo Manekshaw is endearing. She brings simplicity to the film. Having said that, her role lacks impact. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/fatima-sana-shaikh">Fatima Sana Shaikh</a> as former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is decent in her role. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Yahya Khan is terrific. His speech to the army before the partition of 1947 is perhaps the scene that gives the most goosebumps in the film. Other supporting actors in the movie do a great job and deserve heaps of praise.</p>

<h2 id="66bf10a824043"><strong>Final Verdict of Sam Bahadur:</strong></h2>

<p>Sam Bahadur is a credible film that is elevated by Vicky Kaushal&#39;s extraordinary performance, and dialogues. The chilling story of Sam Manekshaw deserved to release in another format since neither his story compliments the film format, nor the film format does justice to his marvellous story.<br />
You can watch Sam Bahadur at a theatre near you from the 1st of December, 2023.</p>

He works to make subjects that were seen as embarrassing or not talked about before, seem normal. When a skilled director like Jeo Baby teams up with a veteran superstar like Mammootty, people hope for a groundbreaking movie. The recently released Kaathal-The Core tackles a sensitive subject like LGBTQI+. Does the movie meet the expectations? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<h2 id="655f4ad30b7b3"><strong>Plot of Kaathal-The Core:</strong></h2>

<p>Mathew, played by<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/mammootty" style="text-decoration:none"> <u>Mammootty</u></a>, used to work in a bank and now lives in his hometown, Theekkoi, Pala, with his wife Omana (played by<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/jyothika" style="text-decoration:none"> <u>Jyothika</u></a>) and father. They are a simple Roman Catholic family who lead a straightforward life. Mathew and Omana have a daughter named Femi, who is a college student living in a hostel. One day, just before Mathew is about to enter the local election in his area, Omana files for divorce. She claims that Mathew is gay and is in a relationship with a driving school instructor Thankan in Theekkoi (played by Sudhi Kozhikode). Mathew&#39;s political party sees an opportunity to benefit from the situation, showcasing their progressive image. On the other hand, the opposing party uses Omana&#39;s accusations against Mathew for their own advantage. In response to Omana&#39;s claims, Mathew decides to fight back in court because he doesn&#39;t want to break up his family. The story also explores how their daughter Femi is affected by this situation. Additionally, it delves into the challenges faced by Thankan and his teenage nephew Kuttayi, who depend on Thankan. All these emotional aspects and more unfold in the movie Kaathal.</p>

<h3><strong>What works for Kaathal-The Core?</strong></h3>

<p>The captivating essence of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/kaathal-the-core">Kaathal</a> lies in the compelling storyline meticulously crafted by Adarsh Sukumaran and Paulson Skaria. Despite ample opportunities for melodrama, the writers exhibit finesse by delivering a screenplay that is both mature and concise. Director Jeo Baby skillfully elevates the script, unveiling Mammootty, a 72-year-old superstar, in a role never before explored. What sets this film apart is not just the stellar cast but also the freshness of its storyline, the thought-provoking subject it addresses, and the innovative narrative pattern chosen by the director. All these elements come together seamlessly, making Kaathal a cinematic experience that is undoubtedly a must-watch for audiences.</p>

<h3><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Kaathal-The Core?</strong></h3>

<p>While there may be minor criticisms, such as a slight lag in the first half, there isn&#39;t much to detract from the overall quality of the movie. Some viewers might point out this small pacing issue, but the deliberate slow-paced narration in the initial part is justified by the extraordinary developments in the second half, as demanded by the story.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances in Kaathal-The Core</strong></h3>

<p>Mammootty&#39;s portrayal of Mathew, a homosexual character, is a standout moment in the film, showcasing his remarkable talent. The appreciation extends to Mammootty, a legendary actor, for taking on such a role in his 70s. His exceptional acting prowess is evident, and Mathew is poised to become one of the finest characters in his extensive filmography. Jyothika&#39;s depiction of Omana is equally praiseworthy, with the audience forming a deep connection with her emotional journey. This marks Jyothika&#39;s powerful return to Malayalam cinema after a decade. Sudhi Kozhikode&#39;s performance as Thankan is a highlight, bringing depth and nuance to the character, and significantly enhancing the overall narrative.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Kaathal-The Core</strong></h3>

<p>In conclusion, Kaathal stands as another masterpiece from Jeo Baby and Mammootty. With a compelling plot and a poignant subject, the movie succeeds in establishing a strong emotional connection with the audience throughout its two-hour runtime. Kaathal, at its core, emerges as a clear winner.</p>

<p>Farrey is a strongly recommended watch, especially for those who haven&#39;t watched Bad Genius. Among all the amazing things in the film, what strikes the most as a viewer is how intelligently the film ends, with not everyone paying the price for the wrong that they have done, making it a case of smart foreshadowing; Or probably that&#39;s how life is.</p>

<p>You can watch Farrey at a theatre near you from the 24th of November, 2023.</p>

Read on to know why you should watch this show&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Based on the Bhopal gas tragedy which happened on the night of 2&ndash;3 December, 1984, this four-episode series narrates an untold story about the bravery of many railway men who came together to rescue and help victims of what is considered to be the world&#39;s worst industrial disaster.</p>

<p><strong>What Works?</strong></p>

<p>There are many plus points in The Railway Men, however, what holds all of them together is the story and screenplay, which is written by Aayush Gupta, and beautifully executed by director Shiv Rawail. The tight narrative not only makes way for an immersive viewing experience, but goes beyond by allowing the audience to empathize with the victims of the disaster, and learn lessons from the experience that does not only limit to science and technology. In fact, it beautifully highlights the never dying human spirit combined with sensitivity and empathy, which for me is the biggest takeaway from this Netflix and YRF Entertainment backed show.</p>

<p>Limiting the story to four episodes also works in the favour of the makers, as it allows them to stick to their point rather than beating around the bush. More often than not, because of the long story format on OTT platforms, the script ends up looking stretched by the end of it, but The Railway Men doesn&rsquo;t fall prey to that luxury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dialogues penned by Aayush Gupta and Shiv Rawail are real and relatable, while cinematographer Rubais&rsquo; camera lens brings alive the night on screen, which leaves an impact. Production designer Rajat Poddar justifies the look and feel required for the show, while action director Sunil Rodrigues&rsquo; choreography stands out. Shanoo Sharma&rsquo;s casting is bang on too.</p>

<p><strong>What Doesn&rsquo;t?</strong></p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t really much that doesn&rsquo;t work for The Railway Men, except the first few scenes, which could have been a little more crisp. Director Shiv Rawail and editor Yash Jaidev Ranmchandani could have collaborated on that.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Each and every actor in the show has lived up to their part. Kay Kay Menon sets a benchmark with a really likable character, making one long for more humans like that. Babil, Sunny Hinduja and Divyenndu once again prove their versatility as actors with their respective characters, while R. Madhavan stands out with his performance. Juhi Chawla and Dibyendu Bhattacharya do complete justice to their parts with their limited screen time.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>If there is anything that you must watch this weekend, then it has to be The Railway Men.</p>

But maybe some things should be left as is. Read the review to find out why I say that&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>The Parekh family embarks on an adventurous journey to Paanthukistan to free their strangely named residents from the tyranny of Kimam Khake Thu, and his close aides Maharani Gulkanda and 120 Navratan. The family poses as documentary filmmakers to enter Paanthukistan, and win the confidence of the leader. However, the group is soon met with multiple twists and turns, which makes their task even more challenging. Will Hansa, Praful, Tulsidas, Jayshree and Himanshu be able to help the locals at this fictional place, or make the situation even more messier. You&rsquo;ll have to watch the film to find that out!</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest asset for brand Khichdi is the nostalgia attached with its lead parts, their quirks, and writer-director Aatish Kapadia has retained that for Khichdi 2. Right from the first scene, fans would be able to relate with the idiosyncrasies of the characters, thus setting the excitement for the film. The actors too have maintained consistency in their performance despite such long gaps between the franchise projects. The film also gives subtle messages which get highlighted through the narrative.</p>

<p>Furthermore, cinematographer Vijay Soni&rsquo;s camera lens along with production designer Jayant Deshmukh&rsquo;s designs bring alive the world of Khichdi on the big screen. Ganesh Acharya&rsquo;s choreography is average, and the aforementioned points are more or less what works for the benefit of the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The screenplay of Khichdi 2 is a mix of multiple situational comedic scenes, from which some sequences manage to tickle your funny bone, but many fail to do so, making the whole viewing experience a dragged affair. The narrative is inconsistent and often confusing, which makes the viewers perplexed, and more often not in a good way. The two hour long film seems even longer while watching it, and that is mostly because of the elongated screenplay, forced comedic sequences especially involving the Parminder family, and songs which were absolutely not required. Aatish Kapadia along with additional screenplay writer Sourav Ghosh could have focused more on this aspect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Music by Chirantan Bhatt does nothing for the film, nor does Raju Singh&rsquo;s background score, which usually is an important element for a comedy, as it helps lift up dull sequences. Editor Aajay K could have sharpened the film a little more on the editing table.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>The cast of Khichdi are all seasoned actors, and each one of them have aced their parts. Supriya Pathak is impeccable as Hansa and so is Vandana Pathak as Jayshree. Rajeev Mehta is in a double role and plays both parts well. Anang Desai as Tulsidas Parekh and Jamnadas Majethia as Himanshu justify their roles. The supporting cast has done a decent job as well.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I believe the madness of Khichdi doesn&rsquo;t fit so well in the movie format, as the character quirks sometimes get overwhelming on the narrative thus failing to strike a perfect balance for two straight hours. So yes, Khichdi 2 is a nostalgic ride but doesn&rsquo;t entertain.</p>

<p>Bella Campen looks top-tier throughout the film with a little heavy use of expressions going a long way for her. On the other hand, her dynamic with her team is funny, making you crack a smile now and then. Bright Vachirawit sticks to his strong suits, breaking into a notorious character and making the film float in his presence. Although it would have been great to see him speak more than a select few words as his counterparts went into intricate dialogues, he ended off with a very filmy scene for the win.</p>

<p>Mahir Pandhi and Anahita Bhooshan try hard to make their characters comical and at times even pitiful but it does not work out for them and they often become stagnant placements in the flow of the story.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Review of Congrats, My Ex!</strong></h2>

<p>Falling short of fusion magic, Congrats, My Ex! sticks to being made for the fans of the actors rather than appealing to a bigger audience. The Bollywood-style dancing and the grand setting of Indian weddings only take the movie so far as you begin to see the cracks around it. Keeping moral understandings aside, it becomes almost impossible to ignore the turn of events and how it would not make sense in the real world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A well-intended attempt, Congrats, My Ex! is not for the masses.</p>

The actress is accompanied by Rajpal Yadav and Abhishek Banerjee among others. Is the film engaging enough? Let&rsquo;s find out</p>

<h2><strong>Plot of Apurva:</strong></h2>

<p>To surprise her fianc&eacute;, Siddharth aka. Dhairya Karwa, Apurva aka. <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/tara-sutaria">Tara Sutaria</a></strong> embarks on a journey from Gwalior to Agra via a bus. &nbsp;In the middle of the travel, the bus is hi-jacked by local robbers &ndash; Jugnu (Rajpal Yadav), Sukkha (Abhishek Banerjee), Balli (Sumit Gulati) and Chotta (Aditya Gupta). In an unexpected turn of events, the robbery turns into a kidnapping, with the idea of raping her and then finishing her off eventually. How Apurva survives the most dreadful night of her life is what makes up for the core plot of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/apurva">Apurva</a></strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>What works for Apurva?</strong></h2>

<p>Apurva is a no-nonsense thriller as director Nikhil Nagesh Bhatt wastes no time to set up his story and get the proceedings rolling. In the first 10-minute narrative, we are introduced to the negative forces of Apurva and how dreadful they are, followed by the narrative of how a small incident can have a big impact on the life of a simplistic girl. &nbsp;While the trailer does indicate a similar to NH 10, the film is nothing like the Anushka Sharma starrer, with the story taking a different route altogether.</p>

<p>The performances by the entire cast is apt for the part, with Tara Sutaria and Rajpal Yadav springing the biggest surprise. The production values are top-notch for the genre, whereas the one romantic song in the narrative is soothing. It&rsquo;s commendable for the director to establish the love story through just one song without wasting a lot of time. Some of the best moments of the film include the introductory 10 minutes, the Diwali song, the entire episode around the well, and interact character conflicts between the antagonists.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Apurva?</strong></h2>

<p>The climax of Apurva could have been a little better, especially with regard to the death of Sukkha&rsquo;s character. While the background score is decent, there was a scope in it to build more tension. The dynamic of Siddharth and the cops is also undercooked and a certain instance requires big suspension of disbelief.</p>

<h2><strong>Performances in Apurva</strong></h2>

<p>Tara Sutaria does well at Apurva in Apurva. In her short 4 film career so far, it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to term this her best till date. She is excellent in the dramatic and emotional sequence and does well in the thrills too. Rajpal Yadav reinvents himself and puts up a menacing act. Same can be said for Abhishek Banerjee, Sumit Gulati and Aditya Gupta. The rest of the cast also do well.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict of Apurva</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, Apurva is a well-made thriller that grips your attention right from the first frame and is a perfect watch for the digital world. Tara Sutaria, and Rajpal Yadav are among the major highlight of this survival thriller.</p>

A decade after the success of ETT, Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif have reunited on Tiger 3. As you step into the malls, you can sense excitement in the air around the film as the 6 am show in Mumbai was a full house. Does the film live up to the expectations? Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>

<h2><strong>Plot of Tiger 3:</strong></h2>

<p>It has been 12 years since Tiger <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/salman-khan">(Salman Khan</a></strong>) and Zoya (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/katrina-kaif">Katrina Kaif</a></strong>) are on an exile from their respective intelligence agencies, and little did they know that their past could return, taking the face of an evil named Aatish (Emraan Hashmi). 12 years after parting ways, Aatish is back with vengeance to bring a disruption in the lives of Tiger and Zoya, which in turn impacts the entire socio-political dynamics between India and Pakistan. He stands in between the demand of peace between the two rival nations. How do Tiger and Zoya combat the scenario? Do they manage to settle the previous score? What is it that Aatish aspires to do? All of this and lot more unfolds in Tiger 3.</p>

<h2><strong>What works for Tiger 3?</strong></h2>

<p>The biggest USP of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/tiger-3">Tiger 3</a></strong> is the story by Aditya Chopra developed into a screenplay by Shridhar Raghavan. The film takes no time to introduce the evil forces of the film and invest us into the world of Tiger and Zoya created by Maneesh Sharma. Tiger 3 goes against the template of spy films established by YRF in the last few years, as this one is driven by a coherent story that brings it all together and even closes a lot of loops.</p>

<p>The narrative is packed with surprises, be it the introduction of characters from other spy films of the universe, as also bringing back the actors who were a part of Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai. The action sequences are taken to the next level, as it&#39;s unlike what we have seen in Hindi Cinema before. The team excels in merging the reality of action with the larger-than-life approach, and it&rsquo;s Salman Khan who makes it look all believable. Watch out for the Tiger Introductory sequence &ndash; it&rsquo;s going to be the talk of the town. There&rsquo;s something magical in Salman Khan&rsquo;s screen presence.</p>

<p>And if that&rsquo;s not enough, Katrina Kaif yet again proves why she is the best when it comes to performing stunts on the big screen. The Tiger and Pathaan crossover sequence is worth all the hype and the creator of the universe, Aditya Chopra deserves all the credit for celebrating two of the biggest icons of Indian Cinema in this manner. The Shah Rukh Khan x Salman sequence has a flavour that&rsquo;s different from what they did in Pathaan.</p>

<p>Some of the best moments of Tiger 3 include &ndash; the introductory sequence of Tiger, Aatish&rsquo;s back story, the pre-interval chase sequence, Tiger x Pathaan cross over, the emotional under-tones in the pre-climax at Pakistan Parliament, and the action-packed finale followed by National Anthem.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s commendable on part of Aditya Chopra and Maneesh Sharma to maintain the flavour of Tiger Franchise and keep it different from the world of War and Pathaan. Full marks to YRF for mounting Tiger 3 at this scale, as its probably the most polished product of the YRF Spy Universe.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Tiger 3?</strong></h2>

<p>At 2 hours 36 minutes, you do feel the length of Tiger 3. The story takes some time to set itself up in the first half, and there is too much in the screenplay for the audience to absorb. The narrative warrants complete attention, with a lot of technicalities which could be a bit on an issue for the mass audience. The core conflict isn&rsquo;t as universal as Tiger Zinda Hai, as the mission this time has lot of socio-political undertones. In-fact, one needs a suspension of disbelief to take in multiple episodes around the core fight between India and Pakistan in the second half. While the story has a new flavour by raising the stakes of this battle, there are certain episodes which lack the novelty factor.</p>

<p>The film lacks behind in terms of mass elevation that we have seen with Tiger, Kabir and Pathaan in the earlier spy universe film, and that&rsquo;s got more to do with the fact that narrative is driven by story and not high points. The film warranted bigger whistle worthy moments. Both Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai had chartbuster music score, and Pritam is not able to match the legacy of earlier two films. The dialogues are good, however, the film warranted bigger punch lines. Some of the one-liners fit Salman&rsquo;s personality like a hand in glove. The background score could have been better and the editing could have been a little crisper.</p>

<h2><strong>Performances in Tiger 3</strong></h2>

<p>Tiger 3 belongs to one man and that&rsquo;s Salman Khan. It&rsquo;s so good to see him in prime form as he mouths all those dialogues with utmost conviction bringing in an irresistible swag in his body language. Salman Khan is meant to play Tiger and he proves it for the third time. While he shines in the action sequences, what stands-out in Tiger 3 are the emotional and dramatic moments featuring Salman. Maneesh does well to explore the actor in Salman, and it&rsquo;s a perfect amalgamation between his larger-than-life aura and the acting talent. Katrina Kaif as Zoya is phenomenal, as she lives through the character. The entire crux of Tiger 3 revolves around Zoya and it&#39;s difficult to imagine anyone but Kat in this part. Watch out for the towel action sequence and her fight scene in second half &ndash; it&rsquo;s sure to bring the house down with claps and cheers.</p>

<p>Emraan Hashmi as Aatish makes for a strong opposition to the force of Tiger and Zoya. It&rsquo;s after a while that one gets to see grey shades of Emraan and he proves to be a worthy antagonist in the film. His backstory is strong with some unexpected twists and turns. Shah Rukh Khan makes a dashing appearance as Pathaan and picks up the character right from where he left it in Pathaan. SRK brings the house down with his aura and screen presence. His dialogue delivery is top notch like always as he mouths those one-liners with ease and is at his charming best as Pathaan. Ranveer Shorey makes an appearance as Gopi from Ek Tha Tiger, whereas Kumud Mishra and co return as the Tiger Zinda Hai gang. All the characters serve as a good easter egg for the franchise lovers.</p>

<p>And what do we say about the END CREDIT SCENE? Just watch it to believe it as Hrithik Roshan makes a special appearance setting things up for the future. We won&rsquo;t get into the details, but don&rsquo;t miss the approach of Hrithik to the character of Kabir &ndash; It&rsquo;s as stylish as it gets,&nbsp;but yet promises so much substance on the performance front.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict of Tiger 3:</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, Tiger 3 rides hugely mounted action sequences backed with power performances by Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Emraan Hashmi. While pacing is an issue at some places, the core plot has enough of an emotional connect to keep you glued on the big screen. It&rsquo;s great to see Salman Khan doing films of scale that justifies his stardom deserves. Overall, Tiger 3 is an action-packed entertainer that has all the ingredients to emerge Salman Khan&rsquo;s biggest grosser till date. Watch it.</p>

<p>The main flaw is the extensive runtime of the film. The film is a staggering 2 hours and 52 minutes long, and could have afforded to lose out on 10-15 minutes. The additional runtime made several scenes feel a bit stretched out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, as good as the characters are, certain characters seem to have a fading importance in the script. The opposite holds true as well, where a character who seems to be of less importance ends up holding a major value in the film as well. However, none of these act as a barrier to the cinematic experience that Jigarthanda DoubleX provides.</p>

<h3><strong>The performances</strong></h3>

<p>The star highlight of Jigarthanda DoubleX is the performance. Karthik Subbaraj has been able to portray Raghava Lawrence like never before. In fact, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an overstatement to say that he stole the show. However, that does not undermine the performance by SJ Suryah who was equally prominent. But two other names that have to be mentioned along with the two lead actors are that of Naveen Chandra and Aravind Akash, who do a spectacular job as the antagonists of the film.</p>

<p>The supporting cast of the film stood out with their performances as well. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/nimisha-sajayan">Nimisha Sajayan</a>, who is pregnant for most parts of the film, does a brilliant job in her role. Although Shine Tom Chacko and Ilavarasu have significantly less time on screen, they do a fantastic job setting the premise for the film. A performance that deserves a special mention is that of Bava Chelladurai, who brings tears to the audience&#39;s eyes with his performance.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h3>

<p>Jigarthanda DoubleX is a must-watch in theaters. It provides a wholesome cinematic experience, with excellent writing, performances, music and cinematography. In spite of the excessive runtime, the film is sure to leave the audience satisfied.</p>

<p>Karthik Subbaraj has returned to the big screen after four long years with a bang. The film he has given the audience is purely magical, to say the least. It is safe to say that he has also created something that has never been seen before in Tamil cinema. Truly, a &lsquo;Karthik Subbaraj Padam&rsquo;.</p>

<p>PS. Don&rsquo;t miss the easter egg at the tail end of the film.</p>

<p>The film has several flaws that negatively impact the viewer&#39;s experience when trying to enjoy the intriguing premise. Despite a promising first half including a grand introduction for Karthi and a title card celebrating his 25-film career, the movie veers into a long, dragged-out narrative that is generic for much of the runtime.</p>

<p>The performances by Karthi, Vijay Milton and Sunil are the only bright spots, while the other actors fail to bring much interest to the film overall. Leading lady <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/anu-emmanuel">Anu Emmanuel</a>&#39;s performance and characterization are expendable and do not meaningfully impact the screenplay or plot, making this yet another formulaic masala film of the kind even mocked by the makers themselves, yet they ultimately fell into the same tired tropes.</p>

<p>In addition, the film includes a potentially compelling subplot about a character mistaken by police as the henchman of Japan, when in fact he is an innocent man just wanting to go home. However, this character&#39;s emotional arc never truly connects with the overall film or resonates with viewers, instead only serving as a plot point to advance the end segment of the film. This makes the subplot feel forced and unnatural in how it tries to tie into the main narrative.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict of Japan:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/japan">Japan</a>&nbsp;is far from director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/raju-murugan">Raju Murugan</a>&#39;s best work from both a directing and writing standpoint. The sluggish screenplay and haphazard placement of songs purely to prop up the film as a Karthi star project fall short of Karthi&#39;s usual caliber. The film&#39;s shining light is an entertaining performance by Karthi, whose comedic timing and charisma almost single-handedly save the film from sinking into mediocrity. While the movie offers some commentary on Tamil cinema and socio-political issues in Tamil regions, overall it&#39;s a snooze fest not worthy of the big screen for those expecting an engaging theatrical experience.</p>

<p>The cinematics. Marvel Studios had been known for bringing comics to life and taking them beyond with its magic. While, the recent few years have shouldered the brunt of the reception with arguably bad editing and visual effects, it seems that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/the-marvels">The Marvels</a> took its time to become worthy of the legacy left behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unexpected comic relief that was once enjoyed by fans of earlier MCU seems to have returned. It&#39;s not in-your-face and even slightly questionable like in Deadpool and neither is it flat falling like in the past couple of films. The humor is spread out and light, not needing a lot to engage the viewers, which may after all work in its favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Bads</strong></p>

<p>The highly anticipated Marvel Studios creation, led by Captain Marvel&rsquo;s story, breaks into havoc quite early on. As multiple teleportations&nbsp;happen all at once, the action scenes are scarce, breaking flow every too often. At times, it even seems that there are too many superheroes with only one not-so-evil villain, diminishing the power of the revenge story.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/park-seo-joon">Park Seo Joon</a>&rsquo;s role- or lack thereof- may just become a major downfall for fans of the star who probably went in expecting more than one verse of singing and short-handed dialogues that ended without climatic glory for Prince Yan. His <em>cameo</em> came off as more of an incomplete storyline. Towards the end of the movie, there are so many things in so many places breaking into each other that you almost want them to take a breather.</p>

<h3><strong>Acting Performances in The Marvels</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/brie-larson">Brie Larson</a> does not take it upon herself to pull the weight of the film and it shows. She appears almost nonchalant in some scenes which one would not expect from the lead cast. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/teyonah-parris">Teyonah Parris</a>, on the other hand, goes in too deep too soon with emotive eyes and flashy moves that don&rsquo;t make up for her contribution to the creation. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/iman-vellani">Iman Vellani</a> is indifferent to her webseries portrayal and that&rsquo;s about it from her as she continues to fan over Captain Marvel.</p>

<p>Samuel L. Jackson has to be our pick for the best acting, thanks to his reigning command over the role of Nick Fury, and we best leave talk about Park Seo Joon&rsquo;s role to a minimum.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Review: The Marvels</strong></h2>

<p>The Marvels is not for die-hard fans of the comic books. For MCU fans, it may be different to watch the movie with context and they may perceive it as an improvement from the last few attempts of the Studios. For unaware viewers, it&rsquo;s a weekend runner that comes full circle and leaves not much to the imagination, making for an acceptable&nbsp;watch.</p>

<p>Ishaan Khatter as Balram Mehta&nbsp;is outstanding. He has a commanding screen presence through the film. The innocence that he brings to his character&nbsp;is impressive. He also dances like a dream in the groovy track from Pippa, Main Parwaana.Mrunal Thakur as Radha Mehta is good. She essays her role of a cryptographer very well. Her part is critical but it&#39;s too little to leave a&nbsp;mark. Priyanshu Painyuli as Ram Mehta is again amazing. His confrontational scenes with Ishaan Khatter are the highlight of the film. There are number of supporting actors like Soham Majumdar, Soni Razdan and others who have given performances that only enhance the film.</p>

<h2 id="66bf108c06f64"><strong>Pippa Movie Final Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Pippa is an extremely heartening film that will make make you respect India&#39;s war heroes even more. There are certain issues with the visual effects and the pacing but on the whole, the Ishaan Khatter film has everything that a prospective viewer would look for in a no-nonsense, gritty and compelling war drama.</p>

<p>Paro (Mrunal Thakur) and Rohit Patel (Abhimanyu Dassani) cross paths with each other while holidaying in Switzerland, with the former falling head over heels in love with the male protagonist. However, they don&rsquo;t get a chance to interact there, and life moves on for the duo. Upon returning to India, Paro&rsquo;s father Navjot (Paresh Rawal) and brothers Yuvraj (Sharman Joshi) and Bhajji (Abhishek Banerjee) scout for a suitable match for Paro, and as destiny had it, they chance upon Rohit. However, they collectively decide to hide about Paro&rsquo;s night blindness from him and his family, which leads to a series of crazy situations. What happens after, and do Paro and Rohit ultimately tie the knot is for you to see in Aankh Micholi.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>In this dragged, elongated comedy the only saving grace is Paresh Rawal and his comic timing. He manages to lift up some really poorly drafted scenes with his impactful dialogue delivery. Furthermore, the interval twist is interesting, and lends a much required high point to this rather static narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Director Umesh Shukla makes sincere efforts to continue that upward graph in the second half of the film, but with the inconsistent screenplay it only goes downwards. Preeti Sharma&rsquo;s costume designs and production designer Parul Bose justify the milieu of the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The overall screenplay and its treatment is highly mediocre, with most of the jokes not landing at all. One of the key expectations of a viewer from a comedy is comedy, and that despite all efforts doesn&rsquo;t work in Aankh Micholi. In fact, some of the scenes are even cringy, especially the climax sequence which somehow makes no sense at all. I believe the major problem with the film is its half baked screenplay and lackluster dialogues, and should have been fixed on the writing table first before taking the film on the floors. Director Umesh Shukla could have focussed a bit more on this aspect of pre-production.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally DOP Sameer Arya has gone overboard with wide shots in the film, while Sachin and Jigar&rsquo;s music and background score does nothing for Aankh Micholi. Choreography by Adil Shaikh is average too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>It is actually the supporting cast in the film, spearheaded by Paresh Rawal that salvages the movie. Sharman Joshi, Divya Dutta, Vijay Raaz, Abhishek Banerjee, Grusha Kapoor and Darshan Jariwala have delivered sincere performances, but also seem a little lost maybe because of the writing flaws. Abhimanyu Dassani and Mrunal Thakur don&rsquo;t fit their parts, and despite all efforts fail to help the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Aankh Micholi just doesn&rsquo;t work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As specified above, Sushmita Sen as Aarya is terrific. The strong and commanding character that she essays feels very convincing because it largely coincides with her body language in real life. Indraneil Sengupta as Suraj is in great form and adds the right amount of thrill to this crime drama. Vikas Kumar as ACP Younis Khan is at his A-game but the writing offers him very little scope. Same goes for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/sikander-kher">Sikandar Kher</a>&#39;s character of Daulat. Shweta Pasricha as Roop shines bright and makes her presence aptly felt. Viren Vazirani as Veer makes most of the centre stage that he gets through the first half of season three. Ila Arun&#39;s character is intriguing and it will be explored further in the episodes to come. Other supporting characters in Aarya 3 don&#39;t disappoint.</p>

<h2 id="66bf0754063ab"><strong>Final Verdict of Aarya 3:</strong></h2>

<p>Aarya 3 has started off well with Sushmita Sen taking full charge of the proceedings. The show however lacks depth due to lack of exciting subplots. The promos for the further episodes do increase curiosity for what lies in front of Aarya.</p>

<p>The movie manages to showcase true events in a proper manner. It is a very good adaptation but needs to be more refined, so you can watch it if you want to see some good acting.

<p>Nimrat Kaur as investigative officer Bela is excellent. The actress has an electrifying screen presence. She packs a solid punch, particularly with her hard-hitting dialogues. Radhika Madan as Sajini Shinde is good. She has a bubbly presence and is very likeable but needs to work on her dialogue delivery. There are a host of performers who truly impress and leave a lasting impression like Bhagyashree as Principal Kalyani, Subodh Bhave as Sajini&#39;s father, Chinmay Mandlekar as Inspector Ram Powar, Soham Majumdar as Sajini&#39;s fianc&eacute;, Sumeet Vyas as his quick friend and advocate, Shruti Vyas as Sajini&#39;s friend Shraddha, Ashutosh Gaikwad as Sajini&#39;s brother, Sneha Raikar as Sajini&#39;s mother and Rashmi Agdekar as Sajini&#39;s roommate Chhavi among others.</p>

<h2><strong>Sajini Shindi Ka Viral Video Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>Sajini Shinde Ka Viral Video is a well made social satire that engages and impresses but not necessarily thrills. Powered by strong performances, tongue in cheek writing and smooth screenplay, this film is a recommended watch.</p>

<p>Aspirants Season 2 boasts of earnest performances and excels thematically. However, its one-tone storytelling makes it far less engaging and compelling than its predicessor.

His performance is very nice. He is able to show vulnerability in heartbreak sequences, very well. Yash Das Gupta as Abhay Singh Katyal plays his role with great restraint.

Ganapath is a victim of the same mishap.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In a futuristic world oppressed by the rich, Guddu aka Ganapath (Tiger Shroff) lands up in the lap of luxury only to be later punished by the privileged for a mistake he never committed. This brings him to Shiva, who introduces the protagonist to his real mission, and trains him to take on the big and the mighty. Guddu takes the good path, but he also has another plan in his mind, and you&rsquo;ll have to watch the film to know more about this underdog&rsquo;s rags to riches story.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>It is the second half of the film, which begins with an interesting twist, that somehow manages to save this rather poorly executed story. The latter half of Ganapath has a mixture of emotions, romance and action, which helps this Vikas Bahl written and directed futuristic father-son drama stay afloat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Production designers Amit Ray and Subrata Chakrobarty&rsquo;s vision adds value to the narrative, while action directors Tim Man and Vikram Dahiya present some delectable action sequences, though there was some scope for newness in that aspect as well. Vijay Ganguly and Piyush-Shazia&rsquo;s song choreography is good.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The first half of the film is a let down, where lack of entertainment is felt the most. This combined with unnecessary songs further impacts the viewing experience. It is true that the futuristic genre isn&rsquo;t much explored in our cinema yet, but doing justice to the genre, especially in execution is one of the biggest tasks which Vikas Bahal hasn&rsquo;t been able to do justice to. While the story does have potential and has what it takes, the poor VFX along with an uninspiring screenplay is the biggest drawback for Ganapath. Maybe, the filmmaker could have spent a little more time on pre and post of the movie before presenting it to the audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aki Narula, Sukriti Grover and Akangshe Chopra&rsquo;s costumes succumb to cliches of a futuristic world, while DOP Sudhakar Reddy Yakkanti&rsquo;s lens also doesn&rsquo;t add any charm to the film. Vishal Mishra, Amit Trivedi, White Noise Studios and Dr.Zeus&rsquo; music is forgettable, while Salim Sulaiman&rsquo;s background music too doesn&rsquo;t do much for Ganapath.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Tiger Shroff&rsquo;s genuine attempt at playing a flamboyant character comes across on the big screen, but fails to leave any impact. Amitabh Bachchan and Kriti Sanon have justified their parts, while Rahman&rsquo;s character needed a little more sharpening. Primarily because the way it&rsquo;s introduced in Ganapath, is dichotomic to how it&#39;s finally portrayed in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>This futuristic drama headlined by Tiger Shroff and Kriti Sanon needed to do some solid work in the past before bringing it to the audience.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Leo rides on a wafer-thin plot &ndash; In fact, the storytelling is as linear and predictable as it gets. While one expects some twists and turns in the narrative, Lokesh disappoints with a rather routine premise. While the writing in the first half manages to hold interest and even sets up well for the conflict to explode in the second half, things begin to drag majorly in the second half. Lokesh tries to infuse action to cover up the loopholes in the screenplay, but the &lsquo;Maar Dhaad&rsquo; does not leave an impact in the second half due to the not-so-engaging narrative.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">The entire backstory of Leo with Antony and Harold is a drag and fails to evoke the required emotions. The flashback goes on for too long without adding much to the narrative. Sanjay Dutt&rsquo;s character is poorly written and half of the film&rsquo;s impact is diluted due to the weak antagonist track. The entire conflict around Sanjay Dutt and Thalapathy Vijay just doesn&rsquo;t work. The action design also starts to get repetitive in the second half, with the climax not delivering the required punch. It&rsquo;s actually the last 30 seconds that infuse life into Leo. After a good build-up in the first half, the second half is a letdown.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">The emotional outburst of Vijay on Trisha doesn&rsquo;t leave an impact as the arc surrounding the latter&#39;s character in the second half is not convincing. The much-discussed hyena sequence is also nowhere close to the hype. The dialogues too miss out on the elevation.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:start"><strong>The Performances in Leo</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:start">Leo rides on the shoulder of Thalapathy Vijay as the actor delivers a powerful performance. He underplays himself when needed to and roars like a tiger in the action blocks. Lokesh promised to explore a newer side of Vijay in Leo and that&rsquo;s visible on the screen right from the first frame. While he is effortless in action sequences, watch out for his performance in the emotional blocks. Sanjay Dutt has a solid screen presence however is wasted in an under-cooked character. The same can be said for Arjun, as even Harold Das doesn&rsquo;t leave a mark. Trisha does well in the limited part, whereas Gautam Menon is actually the surprise package of the film. As a police officer, Gautam gets one of the best-written roles in Leo. George Maryan as Constable Napolean does well and continues his character from where Kaithi ended. The rest of the ensemble did well in their respective roles.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:start"><strong>Verdict of Leo</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:start">Leo works primarily due to the fast-paced narrative in the first half, Thalapathy Vijay&rsquo;s powerful performance, and the LCU connection established through the film. The issue with LEO is in its wafer-thin plot, weak antagonist track, and routine writing in the second half which results in a drag. While fans of Vijay are in for a carnival due to the euphoria and hype surrounding the release, the rest might find it just about a one-time watch. However, its important to keep expectations under check - this isn&#39;t a Vikram or a Kaithi.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:start">From the box office front, Leo is an absolute winner as the thing with event cinema is the fact that it&rsquo;s all fine till it&#39;s not outright bad i.e., even average is good enough. And Lokesh Kanagaraj&rsquo;s content is decent enough for the anticipation.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>PS: Watch out for the last 30 seconds - which is definitely a money shot for the franchise&nbsp;going forward.</strong></p>

<p>Kaala Paani boasts of an ensemble cast and the performances put up by all of them are outstanding. The pick of the actors in the show is Vikas Kumar as Santosh, a tourist who comes to Andaman and Nicobar with his family to enjoy the Swaraj Mahotsav. The actor, through the episodes, is able to depict an array of very complex emotions, from helplessness to psychopathy. Mona Singh as Dr Soudamini Singh is first rate in her short, yet impactful role. Ashutosh Gowariker as Admiral Zibran Qadri is in total control of his craft. He gives a strong, level-headed performance that will make you want to watch more of Ashutosh Gowariker - the actor. Amey Wagh as ACP Kamat plays the notorious cop to perfection and the way the character is developed through the 7 episodes is lovely to see. Arushi Sharma as Jyotsna is endearing to watch. She is a spectacular find and makes her presence amply felt. Radhika Mehrotra as Doctor Ritu proves that she is an actor that can carry a show on her able shoulders. She is fabulous. Sukant Goel as the local tour guide and poacher is also supremely talented and adds weight to the show. Chinmay Mandlekar as Dr Shashi Mahajan, in his restrained performance, is able to create some solid impact. The kids reprising the role of Parth and Vidisha (Payash Jain and Aradhya Aanjna) are very good. Every other actor and supporting actor part of the show, only enhances it.</p>

<h2 id="6603b583b7f3f"><strong>Star Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paul Dano and Pete Davidson steal the show. Paul has Keith stay true to his character, the way he spoke, resembles the real life character. He generated a sense of empathy while being on screen and also appeared to be a peoples person. On the other hand, Pete as his brother was a true funny character, every time he appeared on screen, there were laughs and giggles.</p>

<p>America Ferrera shined bright as a supporting character. She plays the role of a nurse who tries her hand on stock market. She feels homely throughout the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sebastian Stan, Seth Rogan and Nick Offerman as Wall Street Guys aced their role. Big mansions, elite club and what not. They were capable of pulling off such characters who in real life appear to be serious but on screen they added a bit of fun.&nbsp;</p>

Every other supporting character leaves a mark in this heartwarming film.</p>

<h2 id="66bf07a507f83"><strong>Dhak Dhak Movie Final Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>Dhak Dhak is a lovely film that feels like a tight hug. It celebrates women just as they deserve to be. The movie is full of heart. Despite a few lags in the second half, it ends up being an enjoyable film that deserves to be watched by all.</p>

<p>Half Love Half Arranged revolves around a 30-year-old heartbroken gynecologist, Dr. Riya Tanwar (Maanvi Gagroo), who hops on the &lsquo;arranged married bandwagon&rsquo; to get back to her ex. However, she soon regrets the decision as it brings along an array of confusion, awkward meeting set ups, misogynist men, and several wrong dates, before she stumbles upon a supposed right match. But is it truly what she was looking for? You&rsquo;ll have to watch the show to find that out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>What really works for me in Half Love Half Arranged is the intent of the show, which propagates the need to follow your heart, and do what you feel is right. While it does get conveyed by the end of the show, sometimes it also feels that director Simarpreet Singh along with his writers has taken a rather long, and a slightly confused path to reach that conclusion, which takes away from the impact of the central theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, they have represented the North Indian family set up well, which enables them with the right amount of humor and drama. I must mention this one sequence between Riya and her mother (played by Supriya Shukla), which is in the context of apologizing. If you watch the show you would expect the scene to go in a certain stereotyped fashion, however, it does not succumb to that pressure, but presents a truly emotional sequence, which reflects reality and genuineness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the technical front, Director Of Photography Nachiket Pangare&rsquo;s lens ably brings alive the word of Half Love Half Arranged, and is perfectly supported by Rajesh Chaudhary&rsquo;s production design. Shweta Puthran&rsquo;s costume styling is bang on too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>I believe the show could have been a little more concise. The makers have tried to introduce many layers in Half Love Half Arranged, which just adds up to the confusion, making the show a lengthy affair. Some of the sub themes could have been avoided to make it a pleasant, straightforward watch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Screenplay and dialogues writers Shruti Bhardwaj and Karpoor Gaurav along with additional screenplay and dialogues writers Simarpreet Singh and Deeba Khan could have focussed a little more on that aspect. Additionally, the climax was expected because of the forced build up around Karan Wahi&rsquo;s character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karthik Rao, Advait Sawant and Vishal Patil&rsquo;s music does nothing for the show. All these factors combined take away the entertainment factor from Half Love Half Arranged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Maanvi Gagroo is the star of the show, and truly lives up to the quirks of her character. She is absolutely seamless in her performance. Karan Wahi&rsquo;s casting as Jogi is unique, and the actor too justifies the part. However, my complaint is with the writers that made his character way too preachy, which also forces the audience to focus more on his flaws thus making the character and its graph predictable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of the cast, including Supriya Shukla, Grusha Kapoor, Amit Singh Thakur, Shruti Jolly, Bhavya Grover, Kashish Saluja, Aradhna Tripathi and Pulkit Makol have lent able support to the narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Maanvi Gagroo and Karan Wahi&rsquo;s Half Love Half Arranged has the intent, but gets lost in execution.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s delightful to see Bhumi Pednekar stepping out of the small-town-girl avatar and playing a drop-dead gorgeous diva. Shibani Bedi and Dolly Singh are such good natural performers. They bring a lot of freshness and fun to the table. There seems to be a fine actor trapped within Shibani and hopefully, we will get to see more of that. Kusha Kapila and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/shehnaaz-gill">Shehnaaz Gill</a> look ravishing but they don&rsquo;t have much to do in the film.<br />
Coming to the men, Karan Kundrra deserved a better role. Sushant carries the trophy home. His spark completely steals the thunder. Anil Kapoor in a cameo adds to the humor quotient of the film without overdoing it. He doesn&#39;t seem to age.</p>

<h2 id="66bf10eca0c77"><strong>Thank You For Coming Final Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>Finally, Thank You For Coming may not be a perfect &#39;family entertainer&#39; but it is surely a love letter to everyone who believes in fairytales. Despite the flaws throughout the narrative, is a credible film that doesn&#39;t deserve to be reduced to a sex comedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3 Stars!</p>

<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/parineeti-chopra">Parineeti Chopra</a> doesn&#39;t have much role in the film but she lights the screen whenever she appears.<br />

<h2><strong>Mission Raniganj Movie Final Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>Mission Raniganj is a film that should be right on top of everyone&#39;s watchlist. It is among the best films starring Akshay Kumar in recent times and warrants a theatre watch. Strongly recommended.</p>

Paloma Dhillon as Meghna is sweet and charming. She delivers a good performance and shows great promise.<br />

<p>Dono doesn&#39;t fail to deliver. It is an Avnish Barjatya show all the way. It is a debut that won&#39;t go unnoticed.

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/tabu">Tabu</a> in Hindi Films and then there is Tabu in Vishal Bhardwaj&rsquo;s world. The actress plays the complex part of Krishna Mehra to perfection and delivers a memorable performance. Right from the opening scene till the end, she gets into the T of her part and displays varied emotions. There are sequences where she just lets her eyes emote and you have to watch it to believe it.<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/ali-fazal"> Ali Fazal</a> plays a character with grey shades and does well. He takes a little time to get the pitch right, but peaks with his performance as the story progresses. Wamiqa Gabbi gets a meaty role, with layered sub-tracks and she excels with flying color. Watch out for her split personality transition. Ashish Vidyarthi&rsquo;s casting as a head of operations is a masterstroke. He has the aura of being the leader and brings in all the elements of grace and dignity to make his part look believable. Bangladeshi actress Azmeri Haque Badhon makes a stellar debut playing the part of an undercover asset to Krishna Mehra. Atul Kulkarni, Navnindra Behl, and Shataf Figar among others do well in their brief part.</p>

<h2 id="66bf0e9fce67a"><br />
<strong>Final Verdict of Khufiya</strong></h2>

<p>Khufiya is a well-made espionage, which comes across as an interesting and entertaining film from Vishal Bhardwaj. There are some loopholes with the character graphs and slow pace in the US portions, however, Khufiya warrants a watch for the edge-of-the-seat moments coupled with strong performances by Tabu, Ashish Vidyarthi, Ali Fazal, and Wamiqa Gabbi among others.</p>

<p>The first two episodes really tries hard to build up for something huge, it feels slow and the back and forth conversations about the same topic feels tiring. One intense scene was supposed to bring out Loki&#39;s real villanious self but somehow Marvel&#39;s habit of trying hard to add some comical element failed this time. It felt repetitive and at one point I was able to just play it in the background without missing any plot points. The other two episodes pick the pace but my hopes are high for the last two.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Star Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Tom Hiddleston shines in the space-time series and manages to touch the heart with his eyes. Ke Huy Quan is the best element because of how he appears to be sane and insane at the same time. His character is similar to how he is in real life, chirpy yet cute. Owen Wildson is the same guy he was back in Season 1. I waited for some character development but not any major changes was seen. Sophia Di Martino brings a new look with her and along with it a different storyline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Loki Season 2 Episode 1-4 Final verdict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Looking at the streak of Marvel movies and series, Loki surely comes as a breather but still lacks the classic element. It has few references here and there but after watching four episodes, I hope that the last two episodes come with an unexpected twist. You can watch the series from October 6th on Disney+ Hotstar with weekly episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s make this clear, Gen V, is not a stand-alone series, it is for The Boys&#39; fans, people who are already familiar with the concept of supes and what they stand for. But other than that the show surprised and delighted me in more ways than one, and in what might be a first, we&#39;re yet to find any faults. We&#39;ll keep you updated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66bf0846cfa2f"><strong>Star Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The main leads of the show&nbsp;Lizze Broadway,&nbsp;Jaz Sinclair,&nbsp;Maddie Phillips, Chance Perdomo, Derek Luh, London Thor, and Patrick Schwarzenegger, are absolute marvels to watch. As they bonded in the very first episode, things got--ts up&nbsp;pretty quickly after that. The cast clearly has a shared comradery, as every character gets to shine in their own time, but&nbsp;Derek Luh, and London Thor&#39;s Jordon Li deserve a special shoutout, as the two have mastered the body language and tid-bids of Li&#39;s character, gracefully changing from one avatar to another.&nbsp;Shelley Conn&#39;s performance as Indira Shetty, the dean of&nbsp;Godolkin University, impresses as she goes from sinister to empathically manipulative toward Marie.</p>

<h2 id="66bf0846cfa32"><strong>Gen V Episode 1-3 Review: Final Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>One thing that is clear from the first three episodes is that the plot of this series has the potential to blend into The Boys season 4&#39;s storyline. The struggles, and motives of each character are with the aspiration that they&#39;ll one day end up a superhero, which will with 100 percent certainty lead to more chaos as the kids are bound to find out, why they say, you should never meet your ideals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest drawback of Fukrey 3 is the music album, which just fails to deliver. The first and second Fukrey films had some memorable songs, but the third one fell flat on the music front. While Fukrey 3 is a lot more complete as a film due to the addition of a villain track, the makers have missed out on the romantic track, which actually had its own spark in Fukrey and Fukrey Returns.</p>

<p>At 2 hours and 30 minutes run time, Fukrey 3 is a little long for a film in comic space. There is an undercurrent of social message in the second half with regards to water conservation and this could have been cut short. The teams spent a lot of time in the first half in South Africa to set up the plot, which could have moved at a faster pace. The entire track around a South African girl, Mumbasa, falling in love with Choocha is also forced into the narrative and doesn&rsquo;t land well. The same can be said for Manu Rishi Chadha&rsquo;s track in the second half.</p>

<p>Some of the jokes are double-meaning, which probably would not go down well with the family audience.</p>

<h2 id="66bf07ff4641f"><strong>Performances in Fukrey 3</strong></h2>

<p>Fukrey 3 is an out-and-out Varun Sharma show as the actor brings out laughter with his impeccable coming timing through the narrative. He is simply fantastic as Choocha, and it&rsquo;s his presence that elevates the humor in the film to another level. Watch out for the entire airplane gag. Pulkit Samrat as Hunny gets the moment to shine and brings in an element of calmness to balance out the madness of Choocha. Pankaj Tripathi as Pandit Ji is again a show stealer, especially in the sequences that see him make an attempt to speak in English. He continues to evoke laughter with a poker face and is effortless with his presence. Manjot Singh brings in a certain innocence to Lali and gets a hilarious moment in the second half. Richa Chadha is in her element as Bhooli Punjaban, and picks up the character right from the point she left it in Fukrey Returns. Manu Rishi Chadda is decent in his part. The rest of the supporting cast do well in their respective roles.</p>

<h2 id="66bf07ff46422"><strong>Final Verdict of Fukrey 3</strong></h2>

<p>Fukrey 3 is an entertaining ride as director Mrighdeep Singh Lamba packages the film with well-integrated gags and quirky one-liners. The biggest win for the film comes with the smart writing which leads itself organically to some laugh-out-loud moments. Varun Sharma as Choocha is a show-stealer bringing the house down with laughter and the entire gang of Fukra&rsquo;s &ndash; Pulkit Samrat, Pankaj Tripathi, and Manoj Singh &ndash; ensure the right energies on screen. While the editing could have been crisper, Fukrey 3 has enough comic moments in it to emerge a winner at the box office.</p>

<strong>The Great Indian Family Final Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>Vijay Krishna Acharya&#39;s The Great Indian Family is definitely recommended. It&#39;s a film that deserves to be watched along with the family. There is a hope that the strong messaging of the film will be able to create a larger overall impact. Go book your tickets.</p>

However, then comes a mid budget film like Shilpa Shetty Kundra&rsquo;s Sukhee, that is not only enjoyable on the big screen, but will later also remain adored on other platforms because of its relevancy and relatability. Read on the full review:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>An ambitious and vibrant Sukhee (Shilpa Shetty Kundra) is her school&rsquo;s favorite, with everyone confident about her bright future. However, the young girl falls in love with Jogi (Chaitannya Choudhry), and gets married to be a homemaker, only realizing 20 years later that before being a wife and a mother, she is also a woman, who has the right to live her life and fulfill her dreams. A reunion, three old friends (Kusha Kapila, Pavleen Gujral, Dilnaz Irani), and her eternal lover (Amit Sadh) play pivotal roles in this life changing transition&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the simplicity and the relatability of the movie, which strikes a chord between the narrative and the viewer, while making sure to not compromise on the entertainment factor. In fact, the first half is laden with chucklesome one liners and witty dialogues penned by Rupinder Inderjit, and is backed by a strong story and a seamless direction executed by Radhika Anand and Sonal Joshi respectively. They make you empathize with the characters, which is a big win for a filmmaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding on is the perfect chemistry between the four friends, which enhances the movie watching experience. Costumes by Sukriti Grover, Nidhi Singh and Kevin Mathews Koshy justify the milieu, while DOP R. Dee&rsquo;s camera lens and Udai Prakash Singh&rsquo;s production design elevates the director&rsquo;s vision. Badhshah &amp; Hiten, Arko&rsquo;s music with Badshah and Rashmi Virag&rsquo;s lyrics give memorable tracks to Sukhee, with &lsquo;Meethi Boliyaan&rsquo; being my personal favorite.</p>

<p>The filmmaker also pays a tribute to Shilpa Shetty Kundra&rsquo;s Baazigar, which is a clap worthy moment for all the fans of the 1993 Abbas&ndash;Mustan directed classic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The second half of Sukhee is a little longer, and could have been trimmed by a few minutes, especially by the end where the film starts to feel elongated. The whole film has the right point of view of desire, ambition and rights, but succumbs to cliche in the climax, which I wish was approached more realistically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are more emotional high points in the film than visual ones, so if you are looking for the latter, then Sukhee might disappoint you. A lot more was expected out of Ganesh Acharya&rsquo;s choreography, especially in &lsquo;Nasha&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Shilpa Shetty Kundra has aced the role of Sukhee. Her performance makes you feel the plight of the character, thus empathizing with her battles, making it one of her most memorable performances till date. Chaitannya Choudhry as her husband justifies the part, and I wish we get to see him more often on screen. Amit Sadh as Vikram aka Chamgadar plays the part to the T, while Sukhee&rsquo;s friends essayed by Kusha Kapila, Pavleen Gujral and Dilnaz Irani truly add life to the screen every time they appear on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>If you are looking for something sweet, simple and relatable, then Sukhee will be your perfect watch.</p>

<p>Kareena Kapoor Khan as Mrs D&#39;Souza is wonderful and very powerful. She shows the right amount of anger, fear and vulnerability in her performance. Clearly, Kareena has so much to give as an actor and directors like Sujoy Ghosh can extract that.<br />
Jaideep Ahlawat is undoubtedly the pick of the actors in Jaane Jaan. He is spooky, creepy and too interesting to watch as Naren, the Mathematics teacher. His Jail sequence towards the end of the film is brilliance personified.<br />
Vijay Varma as inspector Karan Anand has a remarkable outing. This man never seizes to impress. He has really worked hard on the action in the film and it shows onscreen.<br />
Saurabh Sachdeva as Mrs D&#39;Souza&#39;s husband Ajit Mhatre is menacing. He delivers back to back two superb performances, first with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/series/bambai-meri-jaan">Bambai Meri Jaan</a> and now with&nbsp;Jaane Jaan.<br />
Every other supporting actor in Jaane Jaan does well and only helps in elevating the film.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kay Kay Menon as the cop, Ismail Kadri, is a treat to watch. He is effortless in his act. The scene where he beats up his brother-in-law in the show is simply brilliant.<br />
Saurabh Sachdeva as Haji bhai is menacing. The character is probably the most interesting in the show so far.<br />
The child actor who plays the role of young Dara Kadri is great and same is the case with Ismail&#39;s brother-in-law.<br />
All other characters in the show plays their parts well. As the show progresses, we shall be seeing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/avinash-tiwary">Avinash Tiwari</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/kritika-kamra">Kritika Kamra</a> take the center stage.</p>

The back-stories of all the female cast in SRK&rsquo;s team &ndash; Priyamani, Sanya Malhotra, Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, Leher Khan and Girja Oak among others &ndash; is well integrated to amp up the emotional quotient. The scale of Jawan is unlike what one has seen in a film set in India. Every frame has grandeur written over it. The background score by Anirudh enhances the cinema watching experience &ndash; he elevates the mass moments and takes them to a different level. The score used for Vikram Rathore just adds on to the aura of the character. It&rsquo;s a vigilante film done right.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Jawan?</strong></h2>

<p>Jawan warranted better music as a tentpole entertainer doesn&rsquo;t really have that one quintessential chartbuster. While Challeya is the best of the lot, a bigger dance number than Zinda Banda with SRK, would have made the film tick mark the box of that one dance number that stands the test of time. Though the film has some strong dialogues in the second half, Sumit Arora could have packed a bigger punch with regards to one-liners.</p>

<p>The makers could have easily chopped the Farrata song in the second half, thereby bringing the run-time down by about 5 minutes. The romantic track of SRK with Nayanthara isn&rsquo;t convincing as their relationship escalates quickly. The comic undertones towards the end of the climax could have been avoided as the intensity was at its peak in the sequences preceding those in the finale.</p>

<p>While Vijay Sethupathi rises above what&rsquo;s written on the paper, his character could have been written better, with a stronger conclusion.</p>

<h2><strong>Performances of actors in Jawan</strong></h2>

<p>Jawan is an out and out Shah Rukh Khan show.&nbsp; Right from the first frame till the last, SRK delivers a performance that would be remembered for a long time. From the display of his heroism and machoism to the emotional sequences, action blocks and the hard-hitting dramatic monologues &ndash; He does everything that one expects of a Hindi Film Hero. While a major part of the narrative rides on SRK as Azad, it&rsquo;s the father, Vikram Rathore, who is a complete show-stealer. Every sequence featuring SRK as Vikram Rathore would be greeted with seetis and taalis from the audience. Nayanthara makes a smashing debut in Hindi. As Narmada, she gets her moments to shine, especially in the first half. She makes all those action sequences look believable and looks convincing in a role that requires her to share a unique dynamic with the leading hero. Vijay Sethupathi as Kaali is a perfect casting of a quintessential antagonist in a feature film. While his character is decently written on the paper, he takes it to another level on screen with the wicked smile and dialogue delivery. Sanya Malhotra, Priyamani, Riddhi Dogra, Sanjeeta Bhattacharya, Girija Oak, Lehar Khan, Aaliyan Qureshi, Eijaz Khan and Sunil Grover do well in their respective parts. Deepika Padukone is impactful in her cameo avatar, and makes her presence felt despite limited screen time. Sanjay Dutt&rsquo;s appearance at an unexpected juncture is sure to evoke whistles from the masses.</p>

<h2><strong>Final Verdict of Jawan</strong></h2>

<p>Jawan packs a solid punch with action, drama, emotion and scale packaged to perfection in the screenplay by Atlee. It&rsquo;s driven by Shah Rukh Khan like never before in a once-in-a-lifetime kind of heroic characters of Azad and Vikram Rathore. The action blocks are backed by emotions combined with a strong story. With plenty of mass moments, Jawan is PEAK COMMERCIAL ENTERTAINER and is headed to be a HISTORIC BLOCKBUSTER. Its vigilante done right, with Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s touch in commercial palate&nbsp;of&nbsp;filmmaking.</p>

<p>Haddi is no ordinary film. It is a one of its kind revenge drama that really hits hard. There&#39;s a lot to talk about the film but it can&#39;t be said without spoiling the film for those who plan to watch.

Now, almost three years later, this Applause Entertainment, Studio NEXT and SonyLIV backed Scam franchise has returned with a new story revolving around Abdul Karim Telgi - the man behind India&#39;s biggest stamp paper scam. While Hasal has returned as a showrunner this time, filmmaker Tushar Hiranandani has directed Scam 2003 - The Telgi Story. Since both stories are bracketed under the same franchise, comparisons are bound to happen. Now does it live up to the standard set by the first part? Read on to find out&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Abdul Karim Telgi is an ambitious and an educated man, who wants to make it big in life but circumstances don&rsquo;t allow him to prosper, until the day when he gets an opportunity to move to Mumbai. After shifting to the Maximum City, he sees his life change, and later even moves to the Gulf with an intention to make more money. However, a few years later destiny brings him back to the country - and this time he returns with an aim to not earn money, but to mint it. That&rsquo;s how he starts his counterfeiting career, initially by making fake passports, and then moving on to the big game of counterfeiting stamp papers in bulk quantities. What happens next is for you to see in the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Inspired by real life events and Sanjay Singh&rsquo;s book - Telgi Scam: Reporter Ki Diary, the first sequence of Scam 2003 - The Telgi Story, absorbs you into this world of crime penned by writers Kiran Yadnyopavit, Kedar Patankar and Karan Vyas. As a viewer, one of the biggest expectations from a crime-drama is a fast paced, thrilling narrative, which the show promises in the first episode with the story swiftly moving from one important juncture to the other. Kudos to the makers for doing that with the opening episode, as it helps to retain and sustain your audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the original title theme of Scam 1992 created by Achint Thakkar, was a smart move as it immediately helps the audience recollect the brilliance of the first part, which in turn benefits the second installment in the franchise. Furthermore, the show is set in a bygone era, and cinematographer Stanley Mudda&rsquo;s lens along with production designer Madhusudan N&rsquo;s art manages to take you back to that time. While costume designer Arun J Chauhan does justice to his assignment, Mukesh Chhabra&rsquo;s casting is bang on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The show tends to lose its pace in the second and the third episodes, making the overall narrative far less engaging. Hiranandani has tried to fit in a lot of layers, and then explain many of them, which takes away from the charm of an interesting crime-thriller. The pace picks up again from the fourth episode in this 5 episode series that the makers have released in volume 1 of Scam 2003 - The Telgi Story, but I do believe these episodes could have been more concise and crisp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dialogue written by Karan Vyas is average, barring a few lines, and the cliffhanger at the end of the fifth episode is a weak narrative point to stop, as it does not really seem like an impossible or a hard hurdle for Abdul Karim Telgi to overcome in volume 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Gagan Dev Riar is phenomenal as Abdul Karim Telgi, and is bound to get a lot of applause for his convincing performance in Scam 2003 &ndash; The Telgi Story. One can see the sincerity in his act, and the fact that he was really having a great time playing the character. Other supporting cast, including Bhavana Balsavar, Bharat Jadhav, Shashank Ketkar and Sameer Dharmadhikari, have all lived up to their parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Scam 2003 &ndash; The Telgi Story is sincere in its approach and manages to bring alive the world of Telgi with this crime drama, but it does lack the charm of its predecessor - Scam 1992. Hansal Mehta had humanized the character of Harshad Mehta, which allowed the audience to connect to his journey, especially his mistakes. I missed that treatment in Abdul Karim Telgi&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>Every story needs a completion and the biggest disappointment with regards to The Freelancer is the decision of Disney+Hotstar to split a single-season series abruptly into two parts. It&rsquo;s like inviting the viewers to watch a film in the cinema halls and showcasing the content only till the interval. Splitting a season into a two-part series is easily among the worst innovations done by the OTT world, putting a full stop to the flow of content consumption. With so much happening in the digital world as well as the theatrical medium, it becomes quite difficult to evoke the same sort of emotions and get into the journey of characters all over again, especially for something in the zone of The Freelancer.</p>

<p>The same was the issue with Night Manager as well, where one lost complete connection with the plot through the 6-month waiting period. There are some series that seamlessly lead themselves to the second season, on completion of a certain arc, leading to a much bigger one, and then there are some that just abruptly end. The Freelancer falls in the second category, and it&rsquo;s definitely a piece of content that warrants complete consumption in a flow over a period of a few days, rather than keeping a long wait period.</p>

<p>That aside, the production values of The Freelancer could have been better, as the visuals are not big enough for an espionage thriller speaking about an issue as big as the one that the series tackles. The action sequences, while being realistic, had the scope of being a lot bigger.</p>

<h2><strong>Performances of the cast in The Freelancer</strong></h2>

<p>Mohit Raina as Avinash Kamath does extremely well and has a screen presence that makes you believe in his capability to successfully undertake the rescue mission. Anupam Kher as Dr. Arif Khan acts well as a pivotal catalyst in the story, who mentors Avinash through his journey. Sushant Singh does a good job in his cameo, whereas Kashmira Pardeshi is actually the one who steals the show with her impactful performance, putting forward varied emotions. Ayesha Raza Mishra, Navneet Malik, Manjari Fadnnis, and Geeta Sharma, among others, do their job very well. The entire series is cast to perfection by the makers.</p>

<h2><strong>The Verdict of The Freelancer</strong></h2>

<p>Overall, The Freelancer is yet another winner from the hat of Neeraj Pandey in the digital space after Special Ops and Khakee: The Bihar Chapter. The series holds the attention from the first frame till the end and doesn&rsquo;t shy away from putting out the harsh truth of the global terrorism scenario brewing between Syria and the rest of the world. It rides on strong performances, solid story and a gripping screenplay however, warranted better production values and a complete season drop, rather than splitting it into a two-parter.</p>

<p>Tamannaah Bhatia is quite routine in her role of inspector Anya. One would expect her to look more daunting and intimidating than what she looks in the series so far.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/abhishek-banerjee">Abhishek Banerjee</a> seems like the one to be watched out for, as the series progresses further.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e805c5a5530"><strong>Aakhri Sach Episode 1 And Episode 2 Final Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>The first couple of episodes of Aakhri Sach are a major letdown. The show so far has not been able to do justice to the subject matter. One can hope that the show picks up through its course since this is what the story deserves.</p>

Some of the best sequences include &ndash; The first meeting of Pooja with Sona Bhai, her meeting with Shahrukh and their wedding, the confusion between Jagjit, Pooja, Karam, and Jumani, Dadaji&rsquo;s encounter with Pooja, Dadaji&rsquo;s death episode and the short pregnancy gimmick to name some.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></h2>

<p>While the story sets itself up for a blast at the interval point, the proceedings in the post-interval portions are not as entertaining. While the one-liners keep coming from the characters, the plot goes a little haywire. While the director continues with the formula of gags in his screenplay, most of them in the second half don&rsquo;t land well &ndash; be it the entire sequence feature Sudesh Lehri or the track of Ayushmann with Vijay Raaz and Seema Pahwa in the restaurant as also the extended climax.</p>

<p>As the humor goes missing, one starts to question the proceedings in the second half, though the leading hero, Ayushmann, tries to lift the film on his shoulders. The romantic track of Karam and Pari is also not well-established, and the makers could have probably opted for one romantic track at the start to set things up. The music is a major negative, as barring Dil Ka Telephone, all the songs fall flat.</p>

<p>The production values are also not up to the mark, and with part two, one always expects the scale to go up. Though, the production value isn&rsquo;t something that actually harms the overall experience of the film for the audience, but, a basic upscale in aesthetics was expected. Some of the songs in the backdrop are force-fitted &ndash; Naiyo Lagda and Gaddi Leke - making an attempt to evoke laughter. The climax is a major downer, as the entire monologue makes no sense. In fact, director Raaj Shaandilyaa forgets some of the subplots that he opened up in the second half for comic relief. There are a lot of episodes and gags that had the potential to land better with slightly more time invested to set things up, but it felt like the team was in a hurry to wrap up the scenes. It almost feels like a half-hearted attempt in writing the scenes. The climax monologue is forced and makes no sense.</p>

<h2><strong>Dream Girl 2 Star Cast Performances:</strong></h2>

<p>Dream Girl 2 rides on the acting power of Ayushmann Khurrana. He plays Pooja and Karam with utmost conviction and delivers another credible performance. Dream Girl 2 could have easily landed in the wrong zone, but it&rsquo;s Ayushmann&rsquo;s confidence to enact the part of a film that saves the film. When he is Pooja, you believe that he&rsquo;s a Pooja. And when he is Karam, he brings in a distinct touch to the character. Ananya Panday as Pari does well in the limited role. She brings in the right element of innocence in the performance, though one wished for better writing in the romantic track. Annu Kapoor is hilarious and mouths all those one-liners as if they were meant for him. Vijay Raaz is a riot as Sona Bhai and brings in laughter at all his appearances with the twisted dialogue delivery. Seema Pahwa does well as Jumani and one would get to see in a new space with Dream Girl 2. Paresh Rawal doesn&rsquo;t get a lot to do on the humor front but holds attention with his commanding screen presence. Rajpal Yadav is apt for an over-the-top character, whereas Abhishek Banerjee leaves a mark with his limited role. Manoj Joshi makes a brief appearance and is fine in what he gets to do, same for Asrani ji. Manjot Singh is funny in the first half but mysteriously disappears for a major chunk of the second half. The rest of the cast do well.</p>

<h2><strong>Dream Girl 2 Final Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Dream Girl 2 works primarily due to the gags and one-liners in the first half. While the novelty factor does evoke laughter in some instances, there isn&rsquo;t enough situational humor in the second half to keep the entertainment factor intact.&nbsp;The film depends heavily on the gags, which go dull in the later part and rides on a rather thin storyline. Overall, Dream Girl 2 is a one-time watch for some solid punch lines, quirky characters, Ayushmann Khurrana&rsquo;s performance, and a great ensemble of the finest comic artists. On the box office front, the business will benefit by the franchise value to reach a respectable number!</p>

<p>Nushrratt Bharuccha essayed&nbsp;her role of Jyoti with great diligence and honesty. She showed strength and vulnerability in equal measure. With every film, Nushrratt is becoming a more seasoned actress and it&#39;s only best if she chooses such strong and meaty parts going forward.</p>

<p>Nishant Dahiya as Rafeeq was simply adorable as Jyoti&#39;s work colleague in Mosul, Iraq. He gracefully let Nushrratt take the center stage.</p>

<p>Every other supporting actor&nbsp;in the film does a fine job.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e8096bd44bb"><strong>Akelli Movie Final Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Akelli is a well made survival thriller-drama which could have done with a little trimming. The film is spine-chilling, gut-wrenching and full of heart. It is made with utmost honesty and sincerity. Few scenes in the film may be disturbing to watch so please watch the film at your own discretion.</p>

<p>While many aspects of the show are to be marveled over, there are some parts that fall flat. For a D+ production, the series will leave audiences impressed, but word of caution for anyone going into it thinking the visuals will match up to Andor, it won&#39;t. Even though the plot is rich in its lore, if can prove to be a big no-no for casual fans, who are not that well versed with the universe as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e805ddf1629"><strong>Star Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Without a question, Rosario Dawson playing the titular character of Ahsoka Tano impresses with her acting chops. The actress that portrayed the character in The Mandalorian for the first time, proves she&#39;s capable of taking center stage and holding the audience&#39;s attention captive, all on her own. Natasha Liu Bordizzo&#39;s performance as Sabine Wren cannot go unmentioned. This is Bordizzo&#39;s first-ever appearance in the Star Wars universe and least to say she nailed the beloved stub-born character&#39;s part.</p>

<h2 id="66e805ddf162c"><strong>Ahsoka series review: Final verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Overall the series is an absolute delight. Even though it might not be for fans who are just treading the waters into the Star Wars universe, for time-hardened fans, this might be one of the best series that has come out of the franchise recently. The creator of the show,&nbsp;Dave Filoni, credit should be given where it&#39;s due,&nbsp;as throughout the first two episodes of the series, it becomes clear that he holds much love and fondness for these characters, as many fans do.&nbsp;</p>

The story arc of Arjun&rsquo;s track is done well, exploring various shades of human behavior, the same for Jr. Ganchi, who is on a journey to prove himself. The use of music to create a nostalgic environment is well integrated into the plot.</p>

<p>The humor lands well, and those one-liners keep the momentum rolling in the narrative.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></p>

<p>While the core plot is presented in a unique format of story-telling, the screenplay is too predictable without any surprise elements. The happenings in the screenplay are on the slower side, which gives the vibe of a drag in proceedings. The entire sub-track of Rajkummar Rao and his equation with his father as also his love interest, Chandralekha, is not explored well and rather force-fitted in the narrative.</p>

<p>While Atmaram is among the quirkiest characters in the series, there isn&rsquo;t enough time invested to set up the arc that the character stands for. The nexus of police and politicians is left unexplored. Raj &amp; DK series like Family Man and Farzi have a good marriage of thrill with comedy, but this one pales when compared to their earlier work. In fact, the writing isn&rsquo;t gripping enough to keep us on the edge of our seats.</p>

<p>With Raj &amp; DK at the helm of the affair, one hopes for the pace to pick up with every passing episode, but that doesn&rsquo;t happen as the series eventually ends up being a middling affair with some memorable events and exciting arcs.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Guns &amp; Gulaab&rsquo;s ensemble rides on the presence of Dulquer Salmaan to Rajkummar Rao, Adarsh Gourav, TJ Bhanu, Gulshan Devaiah, Satish Kaushik, Vipin Sharma, and Shreya Dhanwanthary among others. It&rsquo;s among the rare feature presentations of Indian Cinema that has an apt cast for all the characters, as performances by the entire gang are perfect. Full credit to Raj &amp; DK for extracting credible performance and making some of the most outlandish scenes look believable on the screen. Some of the sequences would fall flat but succeed purely due to the faith shown by actors in the conviction of Raj &amp; DK.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Guns &amp; Gulaabs is a middling affair that promises a lot but leaves you wanting for more. While the director duo set up the world well in the initial two episodes, things go a little haywire as the story proceeds. The final episode is also underwhelming, as all the twists that you expect with the conflict just don&rsquo;t land well. It works primarily due to the phenomenal performances and fascinating characters but falls short of expectations due to the undercooked plot.</p>

<p>For starters, if you are a DC fan who reads comics, this movie might come off as a poor adaptation. Blue Beetle (Jamie Reyes)&nbsp;is supposed to be the most powerful iteration of the character and this film doesn&#39;t do much justice to it.&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Angel Manuel Soto told Comicbook.com in an interview, &#39;Let&#39;s do whatever the f-ck we want with it&#39; when it came to picking the comic-accurate story. The end product? A mixture of random stories with no proper explanation. At a point in the movie, you find yourself in disbelief, wondering what&#39;s happening on the big screen. In this year alone, DC has given us Shazam! Fury of the Gods and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/the-flash-2023">The Flash</a>; while both received mixed reactions, this movie ensures to put a strike on the uncooked stories that fail to connect with the audience.</p>

<p>Blue Beetle is an amalgamation of several superheroes from both Marvel and DC. If you are a fan, it will be so easy to pick up the traits throughout the movie. From Iron Man to Thor, bits and pieces of AntMan and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/shang-chi-and-legend-ten-rings">Shang Chi</a>; DC&#39;s new superhero movie fails to leave an impression and ends up becoming a tasteless soup of many remarkable stories into one. Moreover, from the beginning, the story falls flat and tries hard to go up but ends up keeping the same frequency.</p>

<p>Not to forget, there&#39;s a whole sequence of the villain Conrad Caraplax (Raoul Trujillo) and his backstory which is similar to Iron Man&#39;s first part. Funny enough, the whole costume gives out Ultron vibes. Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the mastermind plays the age-old bad guy who wants to become powerful by creating military weapons (Ahem! Marvel&#39;s first successful superhero movie).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the movie leaves nothing to predict and is a pure giveaway, even the dialogue. The classic scene of a suppressed nobody being called out by a random name stands up for himself in front of the mastermind with the iconic line &#39;My name is not Sanchez, it&#39;s..&#39;. Such lines can be seen coming from miles away. So, it is safe to say that Blue Beetle might not end well for DCEU and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/it-makes-things-a-little-bit-more-challenging-dwayne-johnson-disses-james-gunn-again-for-cancelling-usd-260-million-black-adam-sequel-1235908">James Gunn</a> will have to bring in big guns to save the boat from drowning.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e80a3382c25"><strong>Blue Beetle: Star Performance</strong></h2>

<p>Xolo Maridue&ntilde;a as Jamie Reyes leads the superhero movie with his charm and timely humor. He portrays the character well and is the best choice for this role. He has a personality that is likable and also strong enough to fight the bad guys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>George Lopez as Rudy takes the award home for his amazing comedy. He adds humor and gives you something to look forward to.&nbsp;Other actors were decent and supported the superhero throughout the film.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e80a3382c2a"><strong>Blue Beetle movie review: Final Verdict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Blue Beetle was a movie I was looking forward to but it failed to deliver what was promised in the trailer. This movie surely is choice-based and how you perceive it. For me, I would definitely say that you wouldn&#39;t miss a lot if you skip this movie. You can watch Blue Beetle from August 18 in theatres near you!</p>

While the mind struggles to keep logic at bay in this emotional drama, it is the heart that surpasses that to empathize with the journeys of two athletes, who find each other in times of despair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Anina (Saiyami Kher) has a promising career in cricket, and has complete support of her grandmother (Shabana Azmi), father (Shivendra Singh Dungarpur), and boyfriend (Angad Bedi). Things were going as planned until the athlete met with an unfortunate accident, and lost her right arm. She loses all hope, but ex-cricketer Paddy (Abhishek Bachchan) steps in to motivate the young cricketer to take up bowling, and revive her dreams of being a part of the Indian national women&rsquo;s cricket team. Does Anina accept his mentorship, and for what reason does Paddy decide to help her is for you to watch in Ghoomer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When Shah Rukh Khan said in Chak De! India, &ldquo;Team Banane Ke Liye Taakat Nahin, Neeyat Chahiye&rdquo;, the world agreed with him, and celebrated his team&rsquo;s victory. Where I am getting at is the word &lsquo;neeyat&rsquo; aka intention, and Ghoomer plays up on the same emotion. No, there aren&rsquo;t any comparisons here, as Balki has combined this intent and desire, with a moving story of an ambitious athlete, who is challenged by a pitiful circumstance. So yes, Anina&rsquo;s journey does make you emotional, connects with you on a human level, makes you want to root for her - and that becomes the biggest strength of Ghoomer. Kudos to writers Balki, Rahul Sengupta and Rishi Virmani for bringing the emotion of empathy to life on the big screen, and making their audience feel it as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dialogues are in sync with the narrative and the characters, sometimes using word play as means to create impact. For instance, Paddy&rsquo;s line, &ldquo;Your left hand has to earn the &lsquo;right&rsquo; to bowl&rdquo;, combined with Amit Trivedi&rsquo;s background score creates the desired effect. Director of Photography Vishal Sinha&rsquo;s lens ably captures the world of Ghoomer. Amit Trivedi&rsquo;s title track makes you want to celebrate with the characters, and &lsquo;Purnaviram&rsquo; makes you feel Anina&rsquo;s plight, but the other two tracks &lsquo;Dil Dum Chhalla&rsquo; and &lsquo;Taqdeer Se Taqraa&rsquo; don&#39;t do much for me. Shout out to Swanand Kirkire (Purnaviram) and Kausar Munir (Ghoomer) for their meaningful lyrics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, Shruti Mahajan&rsquo;s casting is bang on, and production designer Sandeep Sharad Ravade&rsquo;s work is in sync with the narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>While the concept is beautiful, it is certain skipped and over portrayed emotions that makes the narrative look convenient, and sometimes even confused. For instance, Shabana Azmi&rsquo;s character begins as a strong figure in Anina&rsquo;s life sharing her ambition, knowledge and efforts for the game and life in general, but when a mishap happens with the athlete there is little to no strong reaction from her end that justifies the aspiration she had for her granddaughter&rsquo;s calling. Additionally, there is a sequence between Abhishek Bachchan, Angad Bedi and Saiyami Kher on a Diwali night, which was designed to showcase Anina pushing her boundaries, but ends up being a confused, over-expressed sequence, which does nothing for the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another example of convenient narrative, was underplaying the strengths of Anina&rsquo;s other teammates in the final match, to highlight the former&rsquo;s skills despite her limitations. While the match started on a promising note, it rather ended up being gimmicky, which couldn&rsquo;t be justified by the line &ldquo;Cricket is a funny game&rdquo;. Sports director Dhruv P Panjuani could have worked a bit more on this part. The crowd VFX in the stadium looks unreal and unconvincing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Each and every actor has played their part to the T. Abhishek Bachchan as Paddy is outstanding, and I wish we see him onscreen more often taking up such characters that allows him to portray an array of emotions. Saiyami Kher&rsquo;s portrayal of Anina is subtle yet impactful, and I really believe she is one of the most underrated artists of our time. Shabana Azmi does justice to her role, though I wish the writers had given her character more active participation in Anina&rsquo;s post accident prep, which would have made her part more wholesome. Angad Bedi lends able support with a likable and dependable character, and Shivendra Singh Dungarpur is endearing as Anina&rsquo;s father.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Some verdicts are hard to give. While the heart leans towards the emotions, the mind is unable to completely ignore the flaws. In both situations, what stays consistent is the human connection with the overall story, and that I think is why you should watch Ghoomer.</p>

Sometimes you see it for the story, sometimes for the actors involved in it, sometimes for performances, and more often than not for the entertainment. But then there are few movies that you watch for your love of cinema, and the nostalgia attached to it. Anil Sharma&rsquo;s Gadar 2 headlined by Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel, Utkarsh Sharma and Simrat Kaur falls under the latter category. The sequel isn&#39;t perfect, but what works in its favor is retaining the innocence, charm and the feel of the 2001 original. How that benefits the film, read on to find out&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Tara Singh (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/gadar-2-exclusive-sunny-deol-and-team-to-host-special-screening-for-president-of-india-on-sunday-1235190">Sunny Deol</a>) successfully manages to bring Sakeena (Ameesha Patel) to India, which irks Pakistani General Hamid Iqbal (Manish Wadhwa). He vows to take revenge for the loss of his 40 army men, and begins by punishing Sukku&rsquo;s father Mayor Ashraf Ali (Amrish Puri) with a death sentence. The General is still not satisfied and wants to teach Tara Singh a lesson, however he is unable to do so until 1971, when he gets a chance to capture the protagonist. The news of Tara&rsquo;s arrest spreads, and unable to see Sakeena&rsquo;s plight, their son Jeete aka Charanjeet Singh (Utkarsh Sharma) enters Pakistan to bring his missing father back to India. Unfortunately, he himself is apprehended in the neighboring country, and how the father-son duo later manage to escape Pakistan is for you to see in Gadar 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>Anil Sharma plays up on nostalgia for Gadar 2, which works in the favor of this sequel. From Sunny and Ameesha reprising their original characters, to bringing back the same supporting cast including, Madhumalti Kapoor, Mushtaq Khan, Dolly Bindra and Rakesh Bedi - the director has managed to retain the world of Gadar, thus establishing relatability with his audience. Furthermore, the narrative introduces two classic songs &ldquo;Udd Jaa Kaale Kaava&#39;&#39; and &ldquo;Main Nikla Gaddi Leke&#39;&#39; in this first 30 minutes of the film, where Udit Narayan and Alka Yagnik&rsquo;s voice makes up for the slow paced narrative in the first half. This portion is also laden with many flashback shots from the original, which will make sure that you stick to the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding on to this blast from the past marathon is the iconic hand pump moment, which returns for the second installment in the franchise. Its treatment in Gadar 2 is both enthralling and funny. Interestingly, Tara Singh has even got an upgraded weapon this time, which will attract a lot of applause and excitement from the audience. Several dialogues leave an impact, and are bound to age well for the Indian audience with time. For instance, lines like &ldquo;Tara Singh damaad hai Pakistan ka, nariyal fodo, teeka lagao, varna iss baar woh dahej mein pura Lahore le jayega,&rdquo; invites loud cheers in the cinema hall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the technical front, DOP Najeeb Khan&rsquo;s cinematography brings alive the world of Gadar, and is ably supported by Muneesh Sappel&rsquo;s production design. Monty Sharma&rsquo;s background music helps lift up a few weak sequences.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>While the second half of Gadar 2 has many high points, it is the first half where one struggles to keep focus because of the lackluster screenplay. The overall run time of approximately 2 hours and 50 minutes could have been brought down by reducing two specific songs, &ldquo;Khairiyat&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chal Tere Ishq Mein&rdquo;. Both come up at a time when one expects more impactful narrative moves. Mithoon&rsquo;s overall music, barring the two original songs, is quite forgettable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a lot of decently choreographed action sequences by Ravi Verma, Tinu Verma, Shyam Kaushal and Abbas Ali Moghul in the second half, but one misses to see that action side of Tara Singh in the first half of Gadar 2. Adding those would have helped balance the narrative in the initial portion of the movie. There are a couple of dialogues in English too, which seem unnecessary and could have been kept in Hindi to appeal to a larger audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choreography by Shabina Khan is average, while editors Ashfaq Makrani and Sanjay Sankhla could have collaborated with Anil Sharma on the editing table to give a more comprehensive approach to the overall narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Sunny Deol as Tara Singh is in top form, and carries the major entertainment quotient of the film on his shoulders. Ameesha Patel as Sakeena is consistent but not necessarily impressive, while Utkarsh Sharma shines in many sequences in the second half especially the action ones, but struggles to hold his ground in the first half of the movie. Simrat Kaur as Jeete&rsquo;s love interest Muskaan does justice to what she was offered, but it was the overall character that required a little more polishing on the script level. Manish Wadhwa does an impressive job as General Hamid Iqbal, while Gaurav Chopra makes his presence felt, but Luv Sinha is wasted in Gadar 2.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Technicalities aside, Sunny Deol, Ameesha Patel, Utkarsh Sharma and Simrat Kaur&rsquo;s Gadar 2 is a sincere attempt to recreate the world of the original, and has its heart in the right place. I saw the film with an audience that rooted for Tara Singh, danced when he sang on screen, and cheered for him when he beat up the bad guys. If this does not prove the impact of the film, then what does? So if you are a fan of Anil Sharma&rsquo;s original, then give a chance to Gadar 2. You might love it&hellip;</p>

<p>Watching Gal Gadot on screen is a delight,&nbsp;but Heart of Stone doesn&#39;t do much justice to her. She carries the film, no doubt, but honestly, her character deserves more depth. The movie feels stretched at times and with so many loopholes. If you are like me, there will come a time when you will search for the story behind a character&#39;s personality. Why did they turn into a bad person? What started their villain arc? This movie fails to give proper notes about how Parker and Keya ended up meeting and decided to take over the world. Moreover, there are a lot of scenes that will remind you of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/fast-and-furious">Fast &amp; Furious</a> as well as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/john-wick">John Wick</a>. (Hint: Chase scene in a public place where people are screaming their lungs out).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The film tries to engage the characters in endless conversation without giving much material to the audience. In some places, you might just check your phone and yet be well aware of what might have happened in the story. Oh! Not to forget&nbsp;Matthias Schweigh&ouml;fer who is known for his role as Werner Heisenberg in Oppenheimer is no less than Tony Stark&#39;s Jarvis in this movie. He works on hologram projection with all the details about what is happening around the world and talks exactly like him but makes it a bit humorous.&nbsp;His role as Jack of Hearts could have been used in a better way. There are certain scenes that feel unnecessary and too long. One might feel like skipping so the story moves forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, the movie fails to leave a mark despite good action scenes. With such a great star cast, one expects the movie to blow your mind but this one will take its time.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the movie ends, you will remember Gal and nobody else. Her charming yet captivating persona along with the &#39;I will break your jaw&#39; attitude keeps the film afloat.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66bf0dd09da91"><strong>Heart of Stone Star Performances</strong></h2>

<p>Gal Gadot as Rachel Stone is all-in-one. She knows how to hack, talk to the villain and make them change their mind (basically Naruto) and also most importantly how to fight with guns and jump off the cliff. Her whole sequence at the beginning of the movie will make you fall in love with her all over again. Talking about her acting, she tends to move around a lot trying to do the right thing. She is a dedicated agent who will do anything and everything to save the Heart/Charter from falling down. After Red Notice, it was good to see her performance in the lead role in Heart of Stone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jamie Dornan (Parker) known for his infamous role as Christian Grey shows us how powerful he can get as a villain. He is charming with a hint of dominance in him. While being the biggest twist in the movie, his character development doesn&#39;t get what it deserves. There are way too many loose ends for him to actually ace the role. His fighting scenes and dialogue delivery is top notch but his villainous role falls short.</p>

<p>Talking about&nbsp;Alia Bhatt (Keya Dhawan) plays the role of the second villain who is tech-smart. She knows how to hack into systems with taps of buttons and also can give threats like it is nothing. She takes charge of stealing the Heart along with Parker and well, the whole action sequence begins. This movie marks her Hollywood Debut where her role feels a little overshadowed. She tries hard to maintain the flow of the movie but feels out of place in certain places. Her character is quite interesting and given her history with a variety of roles, Keya is a whole new field for her to explore. In places, you will feel that her character needed more screen time and more explanation behind what she was doing. Overall, Alia did a decent job as Keya but there&#39;s still space for improvement.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66bf0dd09da98"><strong>Heart Of Stone Movie Review: Final Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Heart of Stone is a one-time watch for all the action that it brings. The movie could have been better but nonetheless, it is watchable. Personally, I believe the film deserves two stars but given the amazing star cast and action scenes, I would like to add half more. If you are into action drama, don&#39;t miss Heart of Stone on Netflix!</p>

The topic of OMG was a lot more universal, but this one is a bit more on the taboo side and it&rsquo;s not easy here to deviate from the conflict for comic relief. The modifications suggested by censor board of certain sequences and dialogues does act as a distraction, especially in the close-up shots. The production values are good enough for the genre of the film.</p>

<h2><strong>OMG 2 Star Performance</strong></h2>

<p>Akshay Kumar as lord Shiva&rsquo;s messenger is integral to the proceedings of story and performances with utmost grace. His screen presence and dialogues never fail to bring a smile, and you can sense a feeling of accomplishment towards the finale. Pankaj Tripathi steals the show with his portrayal of Kanti Sharan Mudgal. He downplays himself in the first half and then rises to the occasion in the second half. He&nbsp;excels in all the monologues while fighting the case, and mouths all those one-liners in his typical poker face style. Yami Gautam as prosecutor Kamini acts well, however, the transformation arc of the character could have been tackled in a better way. Watch out for the confidence with which she fights her case &ndash; she carries the confidence in her body language. Child actor Aarush Varma does well in his role, and the same can be said for Pavan Malhotra, who plays a judge. Govind Namdev, Arun Govil, Bijendra Kala do justice to their respective parts. The rest of the ensemble too does well.</p>

<h2><strong>OMG 2&nbsp;Movie Review: Final Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>OMG 2 is a well-intentioned film that has its heart at the right place. The film educates without getting too preachy. While the courtroom debates could have been a little more exciting, the biggest W for the film is its ability to engage and entertain despite falling in the bracket of a &lsquo;Taboo&rsquo;. The irony of the situation lies in the fact that the censor board itself fell for the taboo that the film is trying to address and break. OMG 2 is certainly a film that could start some conversations that people are usually awkward to talk about and full marks to the makers for attempting a film on this subject. It&rsquo;s also commendable for a mainstream movie star like Akshay Kumar to touch upon the subject of Sex Education. Recommended.</p>

The aforementioned 4 blocks leave an even better impact due to the background score of Anirudh, which does complete justice to the aura of Rajinikanth. The dialogues ensure enough claptrap moments. The family angle, especially in the initial few frames are done well and brings a smile on your face.</p>

<p>The entire villain track, led by Vinayakan, is also done well, when in the intense space.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></h2>

<p>Jailer is tad too long for the plot that Nelson has in his hand. The filmmaker could have easily put out a crisper version of the same film for a better impact. While the film has enough in terms of standalone moments, it does go off the track for a major part of the second half, which is thankfully lifted by a good climax. While the entire track of heist would have read great on paper, it is not well executed and hampers the pace of the film in a big way. The Blast Mohan (Sunil) subtract also doesn&rsquo;t click as well as expected. While the humour works in the first half, the film gets derailed on the comic front in the second half.</p>

<p>Some of the sub-plots are left unexplored &ndash; be it the entire nexus of the police department working hand-to-hand with the stolen artifact&rsquo;s mafia, or the arc of Tiger Muthuvel Pandian&rsquo;s family members. The antagonist track doesn&rsquo;t work when Nelson attempts to marry the intensity with his dark comedy. The entire psychiatrist angle in the first half doesn&#39;t land well.&nbsp;Pacing is also an issue through the film, as there are a lot of moments which drag and there are also some sequences which add nothing to the narrative.</p>

<h2><strong>Jailer Star Performances</strong></h2>

<p>Jailer is a superstar Rajinikanth show. The film isn&rsquo;t just about the display of Rajinikanth&rsquo;s superstardom and antiques, but also has enough scenes that puts forward Rajinikanth &ndash; The actor. He aces the emotional, dramatic, comic and heroic scenes with perfection and has a screen presence that very few in Indian can command. The film rides on Rajinikanth&rsquo;s shoulders and they are strong enough to take the film through.</p>

<p>Vinayakan is menacing in his part of a dangerous antagonist, Verma and does well to be the baddie alongside a force like Rajinikanth. Mohanlal has a stellar cameo and his appearance is sure to be greeted with seeti&rsquo;s and taali&rsquo;s all across the board, especially in Kerala. He has a dynamic presence. Same for Shiva Rajkumar, who gets an excellent introduction to this tale. Jackie Shroff is decent in his appearance. Ramya Krishnan has limited screen time, but she does well in the allotted role. Same for Mirnaa Menon and the child artist, Ritvik. Tamannaah&rsquo;s cameo is decent, but her track is a complete let down.</p>

<h2><strong>Jailer Movie Review: Final Verdict</strong>:</h2>

<p>Jailer works, but in parts. When it&rsquo;s good, it&rsquo;s very good. But when it&rsquo;s bad, it just drags. Nelson succeeds in his attempt to celebrate the stardom of Rajinikanth and blends it with a performance driven character, however, the film warranted a better screenplay to drive the proceedings. It&rsquo;s a decent entertainer that works due to the aura of Rajinikanth in mass blocks alongside the dynamic cameos by Mohanlal and Shiva Rajkumar. Jailer has enough moments to emerge a box office winner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the movie tries to keep you engaged with the story, there are parts where it feels like it is clumsy writing. There are loopholes and some significance that was left unexplained. You might forget the movie after an hour of watching given the horror isn&#39;t similar to that of The Conjuring, Sinister etc.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e911ac837b9"><strong>Star Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Sophie Wilde (Mia) along with Joe Bird (Riley) takes the limelight throughout the movie. The duo was terrific and made sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. Joe&#39;s acting as the possessed human takes the lead given the emotions he portrays throughout the movie is inexplicable. His scenes at the hospital was mind-boggling.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e911ac837bc"><strong>Talk to Me movie review: Final Verdict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The movie is a one-time watch and will keep you engaged for the time duration of 1 hour 35 mins! Don&#39;t expect jump scares because the movie has a subtle way of scaring the audience. You can watch Talk to Me in theatres near you!</p>

<p>Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani tends to get superficial in its treatment at certain places. Karan tries to say and wrap too many social things in the narrative, which results in him divulging from the core plot points of family drama. The humor tends to go a little too loud in the first half, and not all jokes land well. Certain episodes in the first 40 minutes of the second half are stretched and could have been easily edited to make for a tighter film. The episodes of &lsquo;Lingerie Shopping&rsquo;, &lsquo;Dhanlaxmi Sweets&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Some of the Romance between Kalwa and Jamini&rsquo; didn&#39;t land well. The film needed some more romantic sequences between Rocky and Rani for the proceedings in the second half to have a bigger impact.</p>

<p>The film is more of a family drama than a love story &ndash; and this can be the biggest plus or the biggest negative for the film depending on what section of the audience ends up consuming the film in the long run. For the 40+ audience, this is a plus point, but for the youth, this might be a little alienating. The music of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani by Pritam could have been a lot better, as good music would have pushed the buzz and curiosity around the film to another level.</p>

<h2><strong>Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani Cast Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Ranveer Singh shines as Rocky Randhawa. He&rsquo;s a firecracker throughout the film living the character, that&rsquo;s very close to his real self. It&rsquo;s a loud and over-the-top character that could have completely misfired, but it&rsquo;s his aura that ensures a safe landing. The fate of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani actually depended on the portrayal of Rocky and not many in the industry have the ability to pull off such an outlandish act with ease. Alia Bhatt is the soul of Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani &ndash; from the first frame to the last, her screen presence makes up for all the flaws. She gets to display a wide range of emotions &ndash; from being fearless to emotional and comical &ndash; and she aces the role with flying colors. It&rsquo;s actually the performances of the two leads that lift the film even in the dull moments.</p>

<p>Dharmendra as Kanwal brings about the laughter moments, whereas Shabana Azmi as Jamini makes her presence felt despite a limited screen time. Jaya Bachchan as Dhanlakshmi Randhawa does well in the part written for her, however, her character reaps of being a stereotypical mother-in-law that one has grown up seeing in the daily soaps. Aamir Bashir, Kshitee Jog, Anjali Anand, Namit Das, Churni Ganguly, Tota Roy Choudhary, and Abhinav Sharma among others do well in their respective roles.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict:</strong></h2>

<p>Karan Johar treats Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani as an entertainer that is sure to find its audience in the metros. It could have gone in the negative zone but is a result of the director&rsquo;s conviction to make some of the most outlandish sequences land in the right way, especially for his audience. While some of the humor doesn&rsquo;t land well, and trimming is needed in both halves, it&rsquo;s Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt who lead the film to be a decent family entertainer. Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani is a&nbsp;teamwork of Karan&#39;s conviction followed to the T by Ranveer and Alia in their performances that should win appreciation in the urban audience and lead to a successful venture.</p>

<p><strong>Director:</strong> Manish Gupta</p>

<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Raveena Tandon, Milind Soman, Vidhi Chitalia</p>

<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 2/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot:</strong><br />
Ram Verma (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/milind-soman">Milind Soman</a>) and Lata Verma (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/raveena-tandon">Raveena Tandon</a>) are 20 years into their marriage. Ram is a business tycoon while Lata is a gynaecologist. Ram&#39;s having an extra-marital affair with a woman by the name of Niru (Vidhi Chitalia). He takes her to his holiday villa while informing his wife that he&#39;s boarding a flight. Meanwhile, the weather turns stormy. In the holiday villa, Niru surprises Ram by telling him that she&#39;s two months pregnant. To celebrate her pregnancy, Ram orders the villa&#39;s caretaker to buy sweets from the city. When the villa&#39;s caretaker is away, Niru asks Ram to confront to his wife about their relationship, of course to his displeasure but he promises to inform her eventually. While the duo engage in playful banter, Niru accidentally pushes Ram from the balcony and he falls straight on his head. The story that follows, takes viewers through the crazy happenings that occur over &#39;One Friday Night&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>What works:</strong><br />
At just around 85 minutes, One Friday Night is a compact film that doesn&#39;t waste time or beat around the bush. The unexpected and shocking plot-twist in the climax lifts up an otherwise underwhelming film. It is however commendable that a film of this sort has been put up with such limited resources.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&#39;t work:</strong><br />
One Friday Night is amateurly written and executed. The dialogues are simply poor. Despite being a short film, there are a number of scenes that just feel unneccessarily long and tedious. The majority of the cast acts unconvincingly, making me as a viewer almost feel disengaged through the film&#39;s proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>Performances:&nbsp;</strong><br />
Milind Soman and Raveena Tandon give very basic performances. There&#39;s visibly a lack of prep that the two have put in for their part in the film. Milind in the emotional scenes just isn&#39;t good.<br />
Vidhi Chitalia&nbsp;as Niru plays the role of a playful young woman with sincerity. However, she too doesn&#39;t shine as she gets trapped in the mediocrity of the film.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong><br />
One Friday Night is a disengaging thriller-drama with underwhelming performances. Better writing, execution and performances would have gone a long way in making the film watchable.&nbsp;<br />
You can watch One Friday Night now on Jio Cinema.</p>

<p>Greta Gerwig has surely proved herself again with this movie. Unfortunately, the second half falls flat while trying to deliver a strong message. One minute, you are laughing at a joke on Zack Snyder and the next minute you are going through an existential crisis. I believe the transition from a comical take to actually delivering the message could have been more smooth. No doubt, it will move you but at some point, you end up feeling that such a beautiful message is forced upon you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e809f429547"><strong>Star Performances&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling remain undefeated. The duo brings a whole package of entertainment with them. Throughout the movie, it is difficult to take your eyes off both of them. They truly are our Barbie and Ken. Special mention to one of Margot&#39;s scenes where she gives up and decides to just not do anything about the problem at hand. Well, that scene becomes very relatable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/exclusive-barbie-actor-simu-liu-wants-a-bollywood-debut-deets-here-1230695">Simu Liu</a> turns out to be more than Ken. He takes up the role of rival Ken to our original one. Liu managed to beautifully portray the character with grace and a proper attitude. He does stand apart from the crowd.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Emma Mackey, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Nicola Coughlan and others managed to carry the film as well. Special shoutout to Michael Cera for just being Allan. On the other hand, Dua Lipa and John Cena surely are ruling the oceans.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e809f42954b"><strong>Barbie movie review: Final verdict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>With its release the same as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/oppenheimer-movie-review-cillian-murphy-shines-in-christopher-nolan-explosive-epic-1231004">Oppenheimer</a>, the movie surely delivers what it promised. Barbie will make you laugh, and give you something to think about. Greta Gerwig surely gave her 100% to this movie and it shows. Right from the set to music featuring&nbsp;Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice along with Barbiecore &amp; Ken-ergy, this movie will never be Ken-ough! You should surely watch this movie and enjoy something different from what we have been consuming. It is colorful and it is bigger than life!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Director: </strong>Aleya Sen</p>

<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Genelia Deshmukh, Manav Kaul, Gajraj Rao, Sheeba Chaddha, Shakti Kapoor, Zidane Braz</p>

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.5/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot:</strong><br />
The inability of a child (Zidane Braz) to talk about his father in the school assembly leads to him wanting a father for himself. A teleshopping commercial convinces him that like all other things, a father can also be bought for a trial period of 30 days. His mother (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/genelia-deshmukh">Genelia Deshmukh</a>) tries looking for an arrangement of a father for her son and looks for the worst possible &#39;father&#39; options so that her son gives up the thought of having a father. After much effort, she finally finds an arrangement of a father (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/manav-kaul">Manav Kaul</a>) for her son. Contrary to what she wants, the son and the &#39;trial period&#39; father get along very well, putting the relationship between the mother and son in jeopardy. What follows is a journey of a trio to achieve familyhood and a journey of two individuals to develop companionship.</p>

<p><strong>What works:&nbsp;</strong><br />
Just when it feels like Trial Period may be running out of key conflicts and falling prey to tropes of predictibility minutes before the interval, it begins exploring some very mature themes like the pangs of a single parent, their inability to communicate with their children on a deeper level, bullying, jealousy and more, so beautifully and sensitively that it elevates the film to a different level altogether. The movie is an unabashed family entertainer that not just serves as an enjoyable weekend watch but a lot more than that. The music suits the mood of the film and leaves a lasting positive impression. The relationship dynamics are explored very intricately and beautifully. At just over 2 hours, the movie runs very smoothly and breezily for its most part.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&#39;t:</strong><br />
As mentioned above, there are parts where the film gets a little predictable and clich&eacute;d. The screenplay in the first half could have been slightly tighter.</p>

<p><strong>Performances:</strong><br />
Genelia Deshmukh as a single mother is wonderful. She is earnest and endearing. Every emotion that her character feels is depicted in a very convincing way.<br />
Manav Kaul gives a knockout performance. He plays the role of &#39;PD&#39; in the best possible way. Words fall short in praise of him.<br />
The child actor Zidane Braz&nbsp;does a decent&nbsp;job. He aces few very critical scenes.<br />
Supporting actors like Shakti Kapoor, Sheeba Chaddha, Gajraj Rao and others do a fine job.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong><br />
Trial Period is a beautiful ode to familyhood. Its ability to touch upon so many important themes apart from the one that forms its edifice, makes it a film far superior than its contemporaries. The Genelia Deshmukh-Manav Kaul starrer should make it to your watchlist. The movie is now streaming on Jio Cinema.</p>

The director is known for portraying a human story, emotions and journey in its most authentic way, and this one has Nitesh Tiwari written all over it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Set in Lucknow, India, Ajay Dixit (Varun Dhawan) has trojan-horsed his life into fairytale perfection with a respectable job, spectacular appearance, strong standing in the society, and a beautiful wife. His decision to marry an educated and pretty Nisha (Janhvi Kapoor) also stemmed from his desire for an upliftment in his social position. However, this image conscious history teacher&rsquo;s plan goes for a toss when his wife does not exactly match his ideal description of perfection. This coincides with a setback at work, and Ajju bhaiya&rsquo;s falsely created flawless image hits a roadblock. To rectify this complication, Ajay and Nisha leave for a trip to Europe tracing World War 2, unbeknownst of the fact that a few life lessons await them in the continent. Now what these lessons do for the couple is for you to watch in this Sajid Nadiadwala, Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari and Prime Video backed Bawaal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>We often hear people say &lsquo;story is the king&rsquo;, and in the case of Bawaal it truly is. It&rsquo;s not an easy script to narrate, unravel and explain in execution, but kudos to director Nitesh for bringing it alive on screen with his empathetic, non-judgemental vision. He has co-written with Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Nikhil Mehrotra, Piyush Gupta and Shreyas Jain, and the team has brought their A game forward for this impactful tale of perception and redemption.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, the most important ingredient of cinema is entertainment, and the makers are able to achieve that in Bawaal, while also making a statement on pivotal topics such as the education system, way of teaching, empty marriages and the impact of societal pressures on it, deception, friendship and parenting. Some of these have been conveyed upfront, and a few have been subtly plugged in to read in between the lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the first half of Bawaal largely relies on comedy of all kinds, the latter part is more emotionally driven, serving something for everyone who seeks balanced content driven by all sorts of narrative tools including drama, intense emotions, satire, romance, and history. There is also a funny sequence involving a Gujarati family, and while Nitesh and his writers do play up on caricature but at no point it comes across as offensive or forced. It&#39;s rather endearing when you watch it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the technical front, cinematographer Mitesh Mirchandani beautifully captures the world of Bawaal through his lens, production designer Aditya Kanwar lives up to the vision of his director, Daniel B. George&rsquo;s background music is in sync with the emotions portrayed on the screen, while Mukesh Chhabra&rsquo;s casting for each character is bang on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last but not the least, for me the most genuine part of the film was Nitesh and his writers questioning their own script by adding an element that tests a teaching pattern they propagate via the movie. That additional sequence adds genuinity to the approach, and affirms the intention of the story and the filmmaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>This is not so much of a criticism of the ready product, but if the same story of Bawaal was set against the backdrop of Indian history, I believe it would have appealed to a larger theater going audience. Furthermore, the approx 2 hour 18 minutes run time could have been brought down by a few minutes, while the song music composed by Mithoon, Tanishk Bagchi and Akashdeep Sengupta could have been more memorable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Varun Dhawan&rsquo;s character has an emotional arc that he beautifully portrays on screen, making redemption an earnest emotion to feel via his character. Janhvi Kapoor&rsquo;s subtle yet impactful performance leaves a mark, making Nisha her best screen outing so far. Both of them even make a good onscreen pair, making it a collaboration I would like to see in the future as well. Though my favorite characters from Bawaal are Ajju&rsquo;s endearing parents, effortlessly played by Manoj Pahwa and Anjuman Saxena.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A must mention of all the kids too who have been a part of Bawaal. They have all played their part so well, and a large credit for it should also go to Nitesh Tiwari, who always brings out the best from child actors - whether it was in Chillar Party, Dangal, and now in Bawaal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>If you are looking for quality content which entertains as well as makes you think, then look no further. Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s Bawaal, headlined by Varun Dhawan and Janhvi Kapoor promises that, and much more&hellip;</p>

<p>Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer takes the award home for the best actor. He brings depth to his character with his charisma and gives a brilliant performance. You cannot take your eyes off him. After playing supporting roles for Christopher Nolan, it is clear that Cillian got the stage to showcase how extraordinary he is. Every close-up scene which includes him is equally captivating as the atomic bomb. The character was not easy to play but Cillian managed to ace every emotion.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Oppenheimer&#39;s rival,&nbsp;Lewis Strauss. The power he holds on screen is unmatched. While we have seen him as our beloved Iron Man, it was surprising to watch him play such a significant character. He gives his 100% to this character and it shows. The best part is how he is the total opposite of Cillian. His character creates the balance perfectly and we get to witness a sensational performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emily Blunt, on the other side, delivers an outstanding performance as Kitty Oppenheimer. She carries herself with grace and brings the right attitude to the table. Her character is far from what a &#39;wife&#39; would have been defined back in the day. She is outspoken and openly shows how she dislikes motherhood. On top of that, she is a biologist who talks about her political views without hesitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Florence Pugh (Jean Tatlock) and Matt Damon (Leslie Grooves) as supporting actors are impressive and will leave a mark. They tend to compliment others in a beautiful manner. Other supporting actors like Rami Malek, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, and more are remarkable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66e9111d24540"><strong>Oppenheimer movie review: Final verdict</strong></h2>

<p>A movie that you should not miss watching in IMAX. The visuals are magnificent, the dialogue delivery is a class apart, the actors are stunning, and it is a Christopher Nolan movie. I don&#39;t think I need to add anything more. Oppenheimer is a must-watch and it is indeed a great movie of its genre&nbsp;after a long time. Watch the explosive movie in the theatre near you!</p>

So when you walk into the cinema hall, you are naturally overwhelmed with expectations, and director Christopher McQuarrie&rsquo;s Mission: Impossible &ndash; Dead Reckoning Part One lives up to that hype. It isn&rsquo;t obviously faultless, but isn&rsquo;t perfection overrated anyway&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team return for a super challenging mission to battle a faceless enemy largely described as &lsquo;The Entity&rsquo; backed by artificial intelligence. If not stopped it will have a deadly impact on the world. So in this adrenaline filled globe trotting adventure, the IMF agent battles multiple roadblocks including a dangerous villain Gabriel, to make sure this power does not fall into the wrong hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest USPs of the Mission Impossible franchise is action, and McQuarrie&rsquo;s part 7 does not disappoint in that aspect. In fact, the sequences in Mission: Impossible &ndash; Dead Reckoning Part One have gone up several notches higher with sleek and stylish choreography, which is not just engaging but also hilariously entertaining. Especially the pre interval chase sequence set in Rome truly keeps you at the edge of your seat. Even the climax sequence has been designed with multiple layers of challenges, which keeps you hooked till the very end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, these scenes are set in some stunning picturesque locations. McQuarrie&rsquo;s vision along with cinematographer Fraser Taggart&rsquo;s camera work beautifully combines both action and the setting on the big screen. Eddie Hamilton&rsquo;s editing is sharp, while Lorne Balfe&rsquo;s music adds so much value to the impressive visuals. VFX is top class, and the dialogues are laden with swag and savage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The story is predictable, and it&rsquo;s the action or rather its sophisticated execution, which add the much required chills and thrills to the narrative. Furthermore, there are a few talky sequences, which are quite lengthy and borderline pompous. These could have been edited much in advance on paper, before putting it to life in front of the lens. Especially, the description of &lsquo;The Entity&rsquo; and its impact could have been explained with a more sharper approach. There was scope to bring down the overall run time a little as well!</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Ethan Hunt, as a character, has built a loyal fan following over the years, and Tom Cruise makes sure that he doesn&rsquo;t let his admirers down. Hunt&rsquo;s empathy has been beautifully combined with his commitment towards his mission, and Cruise manages to effortlessly convey that on the big screen. Hayley Atwell as Grace plays the perfect ally to Hunt in Mission: Impossible &ndash; Dead Reckoning Part One. Grace experiences an array of emotions as she gets to know Hunt during the narrative, and Atwell portrays those feelings quite well in the film. Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell and Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn are consistent, while Ilsa Faust&rsquo;s (played by Rebecca Ferguson) track will make you emotional. Esai Morales as the antagonist Gabriel stands out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Christopher McQuarrie&rsquo;s Mission Impossible 7 headlined by Tom Cruise, with its entertaining and engaging approach, will set the cash registers ringing at the box office.</p>

I had the same feeling while watching director Anu Menon&rsquo;s Neeyat, however, my reason was completely different. I wanted the movie to end because it took way too long to reach its conclusion, and by the time it did I had lost interest. Read on to know what worked for me in this Vidya Balan starrer, and what didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>On a stormy night in Scotland, exiled businessman Ashish Kapoor aka AK (Ram Kapoor) celebrates his birthday at a grand castle in the presence of his near and dear ones. While tension between the attendees is visible from the first frame, things started going downhill when AK announced a crucial decision, which involved detective Mira Rao (Vidya Balan). This change in event leads to a chain of events, and what happens thereafter is for you to see in Neeyat.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The most stunning aspect of Menon&rsquo;s world is its setting. The whole incident happens in one house and its surrounding area. Its isolated and creepy vibe was the perfect backdrop to narrate a suspense-thriller. While production designer Stacey Dickinson beautifully brought this vision to life, DOP Andreas Neo contributed equally by keeping most of the frames interactive and engaging. However, I do feel that the palace merely ended up being a prop for the story, rather than utilizing its nook and corners to add more thrill to the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, background music helped elevate pompous sequences, while costume designer Aastha Sharma stayed true to the milieu.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>While the story is average, partly predictable, it is its execution which is even more faulty. Firstly, it takes forever to reach the murder, and then it keeps adding many unnecessary layers, which does nothing for the mystery part of the story. One of the most important aspects of a good suspense driven narrative is its pace, and screenplay writers Anu Menon, Priya Venkataraman, Advaita Kala and Girvani Dhyani along with editor Adam Moss could have focussed a little more on this aspect. The scenes seemed extremely choreographed and rehearsed, while Kausar Munir&rsquo;s dialogues also don&rsquo;t add any charm to this snore fest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, lines like &lsquo;I need a volunteer&rsquo; could have easily been replaced by a dialogue that straight away ordered the required action. There are many smaller instances like these in the film that could have been worked upon to add speed to the narrative. Action supervised by Jamie B. Chambers is forgettable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Vidya Balan&rsquo;s portrayal of a CBI personnel is confusing and often frustrating during the narrative, but there is a reason behind that under confident depiction and the actress brings that to life beautifully on the big screen. However, I would like to add that from a genre perspective, I wish the makers would have taken some other route to portray that aspect of Mira Rao&rsquo;s personality, because especially in the second half the lack of confidence really tests your patience as an audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ram Kapoor, Rahul Bose, Shahana Goswami, Dipannita Sharma Atwal, Shashank Arora and Prajakta Koli live up to their parts, while Neeraj Kabi, Niki Walia, Amrita Puri and Danesh Razvi seemed misfit for their characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Is film ki neeyat mein nahin, execution mein khot hai.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Night Manager 2 follows the story of Shaan Sengupta (Aditya Roy Kapur), who has successfully infiltrated himself in the army of leading weapon dealer, Shelly Rungta (Anil Kapoor), while working undercover for Indian Intelligence Agencies. Much like all espionage films, Night Manager is also about how a man rises against all odds to protect against an attack on the country. Does he manage to emerge a winner, or does he double-cross the Indian agencies? Watch it unfold in Night Manager 2.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>What works?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">The world of Night Manager is fascinating &ndash; Director Sandeep Modi does well in establishing the characters by keeping an arc of grey to all the key protagonists. He sets up the story well in season one and keeps the consistency intact in the second season. The emotional elements in the finale also hit the right note.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">The performances by Anil Kapoor, Aditya Roy Kapur, and Shobita Dhulipala alongside everyone in the ensemble lift the impact of some of the dramatic portions. The action scenes are neatly done, and the dialogues are strong. Some of the sequences keep you on the edge of your seat, however, the writing doesn&rsquo;t have enough twists and turns that one expects from espionage.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Night Manager 2 isn&rsquo;t as gripping as the first season. There is a dip in the pace as also the plot doesn&rsquo;t have enough high points. The episodes move in a predictable manner, and right from the beginning of the new season, you know how the series ends.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">The teaser of the new season promised a lot of action, but there is little that the second season has to offer on the action front. In fact, the one prolonged set piece isn&rsquo;t exactly an action scene.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Performances:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Aditya Roy Kapur does well as Shaan Sengupta and continues to dominate with his excellent screen presence. He gets the moments of heroism too and excels in his part. This is the best that Aditya Roy Kapur has looked in a feature presentation. He stands tall in front of a stalwart like Anil Kapoor too. Anil Kapoor is having lots of fun playing the bad man in this series. He plays the role of a rich, arrogant, and overconfident businessman with utmost conviction. In fact, it has been a while since one has seen Anil Kapoor in this avatar.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Shobita Dhulipala does well in her part and brings in the glam element to the tale. Naved Jaffrey, Tillotama Shome, and Saswata Chatterjee among others do well in their respective roles.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Night Manager 2 is a decent watch despite the predictable screenplay. It rides primarily on scale and style, though, misses out on the twists and turns. A continued watch rather than splitting it into two seasons would have resulted in a better impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Satyaprem Ki Katha unfolds with a middle-class boy in Ahmedabad, Satyaprem (Kartik Aaryan) falling in one-sided love with Katha (Kiara Advani), who is coping with her breakup with Tapan. Through the journey, the duo discovers each other&rsquo;s life and complement in accomplishing what was left halfway through back in the day. The core conflict of the film is about how Katha completes an arc for Satyaprem, and eventually, how the latter too becomes the support system to the former to complete an unfinished task. What are the conflicts? What acts as a hurdle in Satyaprem and Katha&rsquo;s love story? You discover that through Satyaprem Ki Katha.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>What works?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Satyaprem Ki Katha is a pure romantic saga after a long time and comes across as a breeze of fresh air in the middle of big-ticket action films and larger-than-life entertainers. Director Sameer Vidwans revisits a genre that Bollywood is known for and excels in narrating an important tale with utmost sensitivity without getting too preachy. While the first half has all the usual trappings of a commercial love story, the film slips into the dramatic mold in the second half, where the emotions unfold.&nbsp; The team has done well to keep the core conflict of Satyaprem Ki Katha under wraps, which should come across as a surprise to the audience.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">The emotions hit the right note, whereas the character arcs for the two leads are well-defined, with an element of redemption towards the second half. The comic portion in the initial frames brings a smile, and the romantic track unfolds in a delightful way but the real win for Satyaprem Ki Katha is in getting the emotions right. You feel for Katha, and you root for Satyaprem to be the support system. It&rsquo;s an aspirational protagonist after a while as every girl would want to be affiliated with an understanding male protagonist like Satyaprem.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">The screenplay is well written, and the writers do well in the dialogue front too to present a Gujarati Family in the right way without taking the stereotypical route of making the characters loud and irritating.Sajid Nadiadwala ensures good production values, much like all other films from his banner.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Satyaprem Ki Katha could have been trimmed by about 10 minutes for a better impact, especially in the first half, which takes a little longer to come to the point. Rajpal Yadav&rsquo;s track warranted better writing, resulting in a much funnier outcome. The conflict of the film is slightly urban, and hence, the appreciation will primarily come from the metros.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">&nbsp;The placement of Pasoori in the narrative takes away the flavor created by the director in the plot points preceding the song. The placement of Pasoori as also the recreation of Pasoori could have been avoided, as it doesn&rsquo;t blend into the world of Satyaprem Ki Katha. While the film has two hit songs &ndash; Aaj Ke Baad, and Naseeb &ndash; the overall album could have been better, especially given the fact that the film is a love story.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Kartik Aaryan is a revelation as Satyaprem as he approaches the character with utmost sincerity and brings in the much-needed flavor of innocence in his dialogue delivery. This can be termed his career-best act, especially for the sensitivity shown in the second half. Satyaprem is also the most aspirational character played by Kartik to date, much like most of the superstars in the 1990s, and this should help him win over the family audience. One usually roots for an actor in an action film, but Satyaprem Ki Katha is a love story that makes you root for the protagonist.</p>

<p style="text-align:start">Kiara Advani as Katha brings in an element of maturity in her performance. It&rsquo;s a tricky role as one wrong note on the emotional front and everything goes for a toss, but Kiara excels in approaching and making this well-written character her own. Watch out for her outburst in the second half that takes her on a bad memory trip. She is phenomenal all throughout. Gajraj Rao and his interactions with Kartik result in some heartwarming moments through the narrative. His character is also layered with elements of a progressive father but a regressive father-in-law, and he shines bright. Supriya Pathak also gets her moments of glory in the second half and but obviously, she aces it. The others in the ensemble &ndash; Shikha Talsania, Siddharth Randeria, and Anuradha Patel &ndash; do well in their limited screen time.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Satyaprem Ki Katha is a love story with the heart at its right place. It&rsquo;s Endearing, Emotional, and Entertaining with strong performances by the two leads &ndash; Kartik and Kiara. Slight trimming was needed but eventually, you leave the cinema halls with a smile on your face appreciating the maturity that Sameer Vidwans has treated the subject with. It&rsquo;s a Prem Katha that deserves all the Prem!</p>

Here&rsquo;s what I thought about the four short stories in part 2 of this Netflix backed show.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Lust Stories 2 begins with Balki&rsquo;s approx 25 minutes long film headlined by Mrunal Thakur, Angad Bedi and Neena Gupta, where the latter advocates the need for sexual compatibility for a successful marriage. This is followed by Konkona&rsquo;s short featuring Tillotama Shome and Amruta Subhash. Set in the Maximum City, this one largely focuses on desire, fantasy, and what one does to fulfill it. The third movie in the anthology is directed by Sujoy Ghosh, who has beautifully marinated thriller with the theme of lust, with an unfaithful character at the helm of it. Amit&rsquo;s a-little-more-than-30 minutes portion of Lust Stories 2 stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/kajol-on-portrayal-of-lust-in-indian-cinema-over-the-years-two-red-roses-used-to-come-together-1227660">Kajol</a> and Kumud Mishra. It narrates the story of Devyani Singh, her destiny and why the latter despite all the efforts is still the ultimate truth. What&rsquo;s in your destiny will happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest strength of Lust Stories 2 is the variety of genres that it explores in the approx 2 hour 5 minutes run time. While Balki has treated the subject with humor, Konkona is exploring the dark side of it in her Tillotama and Amruta led film. Sujoy doesn&rsquo;t disappoint his fans who would expect thriller in his portion of the film, while Amit combines that with suspense and intense emotions that really leaves you shocked by the end of it. The anthology truly climaxes with a cinematic orgasm, and much of the credit for that goes to Amit and Sujoy&rsquo;s sections of the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I appreciate in the last two shorts is the use of lust as the core ingredient but not just sticking to it, and elevating the narrative by combining this central theme with other aspects like loyalty, passion, aspiration, greed and treachery. Furthermore, the background music across the four shorts lend able support to the stories, while the setting in Amit and Sujoy&rsquo;s films were the hero ingredients. Much credit for that should go to the DOPs and production designers. The run time is apt too, and at no point does any of the films seem stretched or pompous.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>While Sujoy and Amit&rsquo;s films go beyond the theme of lust, Balki and Konkona&rsquo;s shorts seem limited in imagination. They are more anecdotal than stories. For instance, I was hoping that Balki&rsquo;s directorial in Lust Stories 2 would go a little beyond the theme of &lsquo;sexual compatibility in marriage&rsquo; but it stays restricted to that throughout. Ditto for Konkona&rsquo;s story. Besides being anecdotal, I couldn&rsquo;t connect to the climax too as it seemed was drafted just for effect and reaction. When that clearly comes across is when it doesn&rsquo;t work. Even the addition of Mrunal Thakur&rsquo;s english lines while conversing with her onscreen grandmother (Neena Gupta) seemed forced. Maybe the intention was to showcase a modern family, but for some reason it doesn&rsquo;t come through and seems largely awkward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Every actor has played their to the T. Neena Gupta is the star of Balki&rsquo;s portion of Lust Stories 2, and pulls off her character with grace. Angad Bedi and Mrunal Thakur deliver a pleasant performance, while Tillotama Shome and Amruta Subhash get into the skin of the character. Amruta in particular really shines in her part. I wonder why no one cast <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/tamannaah-bhatia-on-watching-lust-stories-2-if-someone-enters-the-room-dont-panic-and-pause-1227464">Tamannaah Bhatia</a> and Vijay Varma together earlier, as they not only make a good onscreen pair but they also emote their individual parts so well. Lastly, both Kajol and Kumud Mishra ace their performance in the anthology. Look out for an array of emotions that Kajol portrays by the end of the film, and how it shifts with every change in the scenario. It says so much about her acting prowess.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Despite a few lackluster portions, overall Lost Stories 2 is entertaining and engaging.</p>

<p>In the past, we have watched movies like Luca and Soul. Such hard-hitting films that stay&nbsp;with you for a long time. Elemental, on the other hand, fails a bit short of originality. There are multiple themes that Disney has tried to cover but at some point, you might feel that this isn&#39;t a rom-com.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Star Performance</strong></h2>

On the other hand, Ember played by Leah Lewis perfectly portrays a character with anger issues who just wants to pursue her dream.</p>

<h2><strong>Elemental movie review: Final Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Elemental will surely uplift your mood with visuals and puns. With not so much originality, you can watch it to melt your heart and experience a very unique love story. Watch Elemental in theatres near you!<br />

Director Om Raut&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/adipurush-screening-kriti-sanon-looks-ethereal-in-anarkali-suit-arrives-with-her-family-watch-video-1225903">Adipurush</a> headlined by Prabhas, Kriti Sanon, Saif Ali Khan, Sunny Singh and Devdatta Nage is sensitive to that sentiment. Full marks to the makers for taking on this mammoth task of bringing India&rsquo;s most loved saga on the big screen, however, many times just bravery is not enough. It is the execution here that fails the intent.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Adipurush begins with a very impactful introduction of Raavan aka Lankesh establishing the character&rsquo;s might and supremacy. The narrative then moves to several years later when Raghav and Janaki are in exile in the forest, battling their daily challenges. Their difficulties later escalate as Shurpanakha approaches Raavan. She asks her brother to seek revenge from Ram for rejecting her, by abducting Sita. What follows is Raghav collaborating with Bajrang and Sugriv to free his wife from the claws of the demon king.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>Now this might be considered as a backhanded compliment, but director and adapted story and screenplay writer Om Raut has made a sincere attempt to narrate the entire story of Ramayana in this 179 minutes run time of Adipurush. He has tried to add as many important elements as possible from the original text, and that comes across on screen. So kudos to Raut for attempting that and getting the crux of the story right. But, now comes the backhanded part of the complement. In an attempt to narrate such a detailed story in three hours, the filmmaker has rushed the screenplay thus devoiding the audience a chance to feel the emotions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the star of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/adipurush-hindi-advance-bookings-prabhas-epic-sells-2-85-lakh-tickets-in-national-chains-for-opening-day-1225902">Adipurush</a> is background music composed by Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara. It adds life to the overall narrative, even lifting sequences that needed better writing and execution. Director of photography Palani Karthik&rsquo;s lens has captured some beautiful shots especially the ones set in the woods, however, the frequent use of wide shots especially in the second half could have been limited. VFX is above average, and Ajay-Atul&rsquo;s music leaves an impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the screenplay had a lot of scope of improvement, and so did the dialogues penned by Manoj Muntashir Shukla. Lines like &lsquo;Yeh teri bua ka bagicha hai?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Jiski jalti hai vahi janta hai&rsquo; trivializes the dignity of the story. Editors Ashish Mhatre and Apurva Motiwale Sahai could have also collaborated with Om Raut to work on the pace of the film. This would have helped to add more feelings in the overall narrative, especially in the second half that ran too fast making the climax even more underwhelming. The end fight sequence between Ram and Raavan executed by action directors Ramazan Bulut and Pradyumna Kumar Swain (PK) is a let down too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another thing that doesn&#39;t work for me is the portrayal of Raavan, who has been reduced to just a demon king with little to no respect to his intellect and skills. What makes the character more rounded are these and more such aspects of his personality, which doesn&rsquo;t come across in Adipurush. This makes the part look caricaturish and far less intense, thus one not taking it seriously. Even the imagination of a dark and brooding Lanka doesn&rsquo;t work for me. Costume designer Nachiket Barve could have done a lot more with all the characters, especially with Raavan.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Prabhas as Raghav is limited in his performance with restrictive expressions. However, the actor shines in two sequences where he motivates his army. Kriti Sanon as Janaki lives up to her part and delivers a balanced performance. Though I wish she had more screen time in Adipurush. Saif Ali Khan has aced Raavan with his expressions, but it is the overall body language that doesn&rsquo;t work. To show his large demeanor the makers have adapted to the Hulk walk, which doesn&rsquo;t truly connect with the character. Sunny Singh as Lakshman seemed restricted in his performance, but Devdatta Nage as Bajrang and Vatsal Sheth as Indrajit deliver a good performance.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/adipurush-prabhas-fans-get-into-physical-fight-outside-theatre-after-cine-goer-compares-vfx-with-playstation-1225944">Om Raut&rsquo;s Adipurush</a> is a sincere attempt but a not so sincere adaptation of Ramayana. Its biggest let down is the writing, and could have done much better if it was was divided in two parts.</p>

<p>Ezra Miller tops his role as The Flash. He is freakish, wild, and messy. He standout for his unique expression and dialogue delivery. The ongoing cases might push you not to watch it but I recommend you to give it a try.&nbsp;Michael Keaton shows everyone why he is the OG Batman. Throughout the movie, you feel his presence and how powerful he is. Sasha Calle debuted as Supergirl and I would like to see more of her in this role. She indeed has the potential to play the new Supergirl.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66bf113c251e5"><strong>The Flash movie review: Final verdict</strong></h2>

<p>The movie is worth watching. It surely helps DC redeem itself and opens the gate to endless possibilities. It will make you emotional and laugh as well. Don&#39;t miss out on The Flash in theaters for it is visually pleasing.&nbsp;<br />

Narcotics officer Sumair (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/shahid-kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a>)&nbsp;cracks down a drug deal, resulting in&nbsp;the drug lord Sikandar (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/Ronit-Roy">Ronit Roy</a>) to kidnap his son in exchange for retrieving a bag full of cocaine seized by him earlier. With no other option left, Sumair agrees to retrieve the bag from the NCB headquarters, and trade it with his son Atharv,&nbsp;who is in Sikandar&#39;s custody. Upon entering Sikandar&#39;s hotel where the exchange is planned to happen, he uncovers the moles in his department and also earns the suspicions of his colleagues.</p>

<p><strong>What works:</strong><br />
The comic portions in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/bloody-daddy">Bloody Daddy</a>, especially the scenes featuring Sikandar (Ronit Roy) and Hameed (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sanjay-kapoor-joins-katrina-kaif-vijay-sethupathi-sriram-raghavan-s-merry-christmas-read-deets">Sanjay Kapoor</a>) work wondrously. There are several laugh-out-loud moments in the first hour of the film but as the film starts to get serious in its second hour, the absence of the same is felt immensely. Watch out for the scenes where Shahid&#39;s character Sumair interacts with the staff members in the hotel because they are very hilarious.&nbsp;The action choreography is laudable. The action scenes have been masterfully shot by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ali-abbas-zafar-on-shahid-kapoor-and-bloody-daddy-its-a-commercial-potboiler-designed-for-ott-1192344">Ali Abbas Zafar</a> throughout the film and to add to that is the solid choice of songs and background music that make these sequences more immersive. The combat scene featuring Shahid Kapoor and Rajeev Khandelwal is shot with utmost finesse. The unique approach to the story is probably the film&#39;s greatest strength. The fact that it doesn&#39;t look routine is a reason enough to give it a try this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&#39;t:</strong><br />
The screenplay of the film dips considerably in the second hour. Films like Bloody Daddy have a very little margin for error and unfortunate for the film, it just doesn&#39;t hold up as the story progresses. The father-son equation is not explored too well and that makes many actions by both parties through the course of the film, unjustified. The cinematic liberties and plot conveniences also pull the film down a fair deal.&nbsp;Finally, action, which is one of the film&#39;s biggest strengths, becomes one of its weaknesses towards the business end because it just feels overdone.</p>

<p><strong>Performances:</strong><br />
Shahid Kapoor as Sumair delivers a very good performance as a narcotics officer with grey shades. He is excellent when it comes to action and he also excels in emotional and confrontational scenes. His comic punches land and overall, he is just a very pleasing actor you can&#39;t get enough of, onscreen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bloody-daddy-trailer-shahid-kapoor-looks-intense-in-action-packed-avatar-as-he-fights-drug-lords-and-cops-1222584">Rajeev Khandelwal</a> as Sameer is very solid in his role of a narcotics officer. He also commands a great screen presence.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/stories/fashion/diana-pentys-impressive-looks-1200728">Diana Penty</a> gives a subdued yet effective performance.</p>

<p>Ronit Roy and Sanjay Kapoor as Sikandar and Hameed respectively&nbsp;have the most fun. They look very menacing throughout the film. They have the best comic punches and they deliver it with ease too. Sequences featuring them elevate the film.</p>

<p>Every other supporting actor in the film makes their presence felt.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong><br />
Bloody Daddy is a very new kind of film for Indian movie viewers. The fun and engaging first hour of the film is followed by an underwhelming second hour, which makes the film ordinary and strictly a one time watch. You can watch Bloody Daddy for free on Jio Cinema now.</p>

<p>It was disappointing to see that five screenwriters failed to bring a refreshing new story. The unnecessary forced emotional scenes where the actors appeared as if they were forced to act. Adding more to it was the most predictable dialogue one could write. I was able to predict the next dialogue easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The funniest thing about this movie is that I believe the writers received the Avengers memo. The second half of the movie has a mix of Infinity War and Endgame vibe. How? Well, you will definitely watch the team get together and one of them screams &quot;Maximals..&quot;, and your brain will automatically finish the dialogue with &quot;Assemble!&quot;. Then switches to the scene where extraterritorial creatures are fighting our beloved super-transformers. You will also get to witness Hulk and Ironman. I lost my interest during the second half of the war.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66bf11cb4fc45">Star Performance&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Anthony Ramos and Dominique Blackfish did a decent job being the only humans fighting the Terrorcons. Voice actors Pete Davidson stole the show with his quirky personality. Our hero Peter Cullen who voiced Optimus Prime brought chills with his dialogue delivery.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66bf11cb4fc48">Transformers: Rise of the Beasts movie review: Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Although the storyline isn&#39;t great, you can watch the movie for the thrill to see Transformers transform themselves. It will give you chills like the old time. Other than that, the ending opens a whole new world for the biggest crossover. All in all, it is a one-time watch.</p>

The series also has a closure, rather than keeping things open-ended. The casting is pitch perfect &ndash; right from Karishma Tanna to Harman Baweja, Zeeshan Ayyub, Deven Bhojani, Prosenjit Chatterjee, and Sanat Vyas among others. The filmmaker also covers aspects like gender bias, human hypocrisy, and the hunger for power in a subtle way through the narrative.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></p>

<p>The sequences in the jail are slightly dark and stretched, which could be a tough watch for the family audience. While the intent to showcase them is to show what all a journalist had to go through for standing by the truth, the in-jail sequences could have been edited for a bigger impact.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Karishma Tanna is a revelation in Scoop &ndash; and this can easily be termed her career-best act. Hansal extracts varied emotions from Tanna, who plays the role of Jagruti Pathak. Scoop could change the tides for her as an actress as the series will speak volumes about her ability to deliver a credible performance. She lives the character of Jagruti Pathak and succeeds in evoking the right emotions for the character towards the finale. Watch out for the sequence which requires her to go through the security check before entering the jail &ndash; she is outstanding in that. Zeeshan Ayyub as Imran lends a rock-solid support in the story. &nbsp;His character doesn&rsquo;t just bring in a new arc to the screenplay but also elevates the impact of several confrontational scenes. His face-off with a fellow colleague towards the climax is among the major highlights of Scoop. Deven Bhojani gets to play a layered character being the pillar of support for the family and he excels with flying colors. Sanat Vyas succeeds in playing the protective yet strong-headed grandfather to the protagonist. Harman Baweja as Shroff again delivers what could be termed the best of his career. His character has complex emotional shades, and he does well to play the role. The rest of the ensemble cast also do a good job in their respective roles.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>Hansal Mehta&rsquo;s Scoop is an absolute winner as the filmmaker manages to marry thrill with drama and emotions. The 6-episode series has enough meat to keep us engaged through the narrative and acts as an eye-opener in many ways and depicts the reality of chasing the truth. This is a must-watch this weekend in the digital space.</p>

<p>The second half of the film, especially the part that leads up to the climax. It doesn&rsquo;t work for me at all. It largely plays up on emotions, and completely gives up on believability making it look a half baked and rushed attempt. In times when filmmakers are expected to make relatable stories, one thing they shouldn&#39;t compromise on while doing so is plausibility. Director-writer Laxman Utekar along with Maitrey Bajpai and Ramiz Ilham Khan should have spent a little more time correcting this aspect on the writing table. Editor Manish Pradhan could have also worked his magic on the second half that seems a bit stretched too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Vicky Kaushal is the star of the film. He plays his character of a small town, adaptive, sincere and madly in love boy to the T. His performance really elevates some monotonous sequences as well. Sara Ali Khan&rsquo;s efforts to deliver a sincere performance is visible on screen, and while she aces the comedy situations, it is the emotional ones where there is scope of improvement. The rest of the cast lends able support to the leading pair, including Inaamulhaq who truly nails his part.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Despite receiving credible support from the technical team, it is the overall story of Zara Hatke Zara Bachke that disappoints. For me, the film deserves two stars, but I would add an extra half for the music and Vicky Kaushal&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p><strong>Director:&nbsp;</strong>Apoorv Singh Karki</p>

<p><strong>Cast: </strong>Manoj Bajpayee, Vipin Sharma, Adrija Roy, Surya Mohan Kulshrestha</p>

<p><strong>Rating: </strong>3.5 / 5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Plot:</strong></h3>

<p>In 2013, Nu (Adrija Roy), a victim of rape by a godman popularly known as Baba (Surya Mohan Kulshrestha), files an FIR against him, that leads to the latter&#39;s immediate arrest. A corrupt and greedy lawyer represents Nu in the first court proceeding. Aware of the bribe that the lawyer tries to take, Nu&#39;s family is suggested to take the help of Advocate P.C. Solanki (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/manoj-bajpayee/news">Manoj Bajpayee</a>). The events that follow, show how a regular session court lawyer fights for half a decade, to seek justice for the client he represents.</p>

<h3><strong>What works:</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-is-manoj-bajpayee-scared-of-controversial-scripts-actor-calls-bandaa-a-wake-up-call-1221210">Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai</a> is hard-hitting, engaging and empowering. The film is gritty and riveting. It doesn&#39;t try to beat around the bush and gets straight to the point from its very first frame. There are quite a few extremely powerful scenes that are stirring as well as moving. To be specific, there is a scene on the terrace where P.C. Solanki prepares his client Nu for what awaits, and there also is a scene between P.C. Solanki and his mother, where he shows his vulnerability for the first time. The courtroom scenes are very well orchestrated. The background score is spine-chilling and effective.</p>

<h3><strong>What doesn&#39;t:</strong></h3>

<p>There are instances, particularly in the courtroom scenes, where Manoj Bajpayee&#39;s character Advocate P.C. Solanki tries to act or be funny but it somehow doesn&#39;t always come off as natural, as compared to the rest of the scenes from the film which are quite smooth. The film is a tad longer than it should have been. It can be chopped by around 10 minutes for greater overall impact.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances:</strong></h3>

<p>Manoj Bajpayee as P.C. Solanki does a very fine job and elevates the film with his topping performance. Towards the climax, the actor shows why he is still considered as one of the greatest actors of our times.</p>

<p>Vipin Sharma is excellent as one of the defense lawyers. Him and Manoj Bajpayee share a great camaraderie on screen.</p>

<p>Adrija Roy as Nu gives an earnest performance and so do Nu&#39;s on-screen parents Jaihind Kumar and Durga Sharma. Surya Mohan Kulshrestha as Baba is alright. Other supporting cast members that include the other defense lawyers, do well.</p>

<h3><strong>Verdict:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai certainly is a film worth watching for its hard-hitting story and powerful acting performances. The courtroom drama deals with the subject matter in a very delicate and sensitive way. Not just audiences having an inclination towards courtroom films but everyone should enjoy watching the film.</p>

<p>Sirf Ek Bandaa Kaafi Hai&nbsp;releases on its authorised streaming platform on the 23rd of May, 2023.</p>

Vishal Jethwa&rsquo;s track doesn&rsquo;t lead itself seamlessly into the story. It&rsquo;s surprising that the director of Ghazi Attack has come up with a rather incomplete film. Though the episodes of IB 71 are based on true and real events, the execution makes us question if it really happened. The film does gain momentum in the second half, but even then, it requires a big suspension of disbelief for the way Pakistani Agents behave in the story.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">Vidyut Jammwal does well as IB agent Dev Jammwal. He is restrained and underplays himself beautifully to play an intelligence officer. He is effortless in the action sequences and the more you see him, the more you believe that a right action story with Vidyut can be a treat for the audience. Anupam Kher as IB Chief N.S. Awasthi plays his usual self and through the years he has mastered the art of playing characters in this zone. Vishal Jethwa acts well, but is let down by a poorly sketched role. The film has a big ensemble cast &ndash; ranging from Dalip Tahil, Faizan Khan, Suvrat Joshi, Mir Sarwar among others &ndash; and everyone does a decent job in their limited roles.</p>

<p style="text-align:start"><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:start">IB 71 is an average affair that had the potential to be a great watch. The film warranted better, or rather, smarter writing to leave an impact though there are some moments in the second half that save it from being a complete let down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/series/saas-bahu-aur-flamingo">Saas, Bahu aur Flamingo</a> revolves around a very strong and powerful woman, lovingly called as Rani Ba, played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-dimple-kapadia-joins-shahid-kapoor-and-kriti-sanons-next-shoot-begins-tomorrow-1196709">Dimple Kapadia</a>, her two daughters-in-law played by Isha Talwar and Angira Dhar and her daughter played by Radhika Madan, who are involved in the illegal production and trade business of a drug called Flamingo, without the knowledge of the two sons of Rani Ba who have just returned from the United States. A death in a night bar in Mumbai, caused by the consumption of Flamingo, leads to the start of an investigation to find out who is responsible for the production and distribution of Flamingo in the country.&nbsp;With the investigative forces along with her enemies behind her, it&#39;s up to Rani Ba, her daughters-in-law and her daughter to salvage themselves from a very difficult situation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>What works:</strong></h3>

<p>The premise of the show is quite intriguing and every character is mysterious in their own way. There is a lot of scope to explore different equations and dynamics. The show is quirky and there are scenes that make you chuckle. The comedy is situational. The action scenes, especially in the first episode, are effective. They are hardcore and look quite savage when being performed by the ladies. Sachin-Jigar&#39;s background music deserves brownie&nbsp;points.</p>

<h3><strong>What doesn&#39;t:</strong></h3>

<p>The screenplay is incoherent. There are pacing issues if we go simply by the first two episodes. The end of the second episode does however indicate that the ante will be upped in the episodes to follow. There are scenes that feel forced or out of place. A number of scenes feel unnecessarily long and seem to be leading nowhere. The haphazard use of curses&nbsp;feel&nbsp;forced&nbsp;after a point. The usage of curses isn&#39;t a problem but it is how ineffectively they are used is where the problem lies.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances:</strong></h3>

<p>Dimple Kapadia, Radhika Madan, Isha Talwar, and Angira Dhar are all powerhouses of acting and enjoy a solid screen presence.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/Deepak-Dobriyal">Deepak Dobriyal </a>looks intimidating in however little is seen of him in the first two episodes. He might yet again become the pick of the actors. Varun Mitra and Ashish Verma as Rani Ma&#39;s sons so far have nothing interesting to offer. They are let down by the writing. Jimit Trivedi as the investigating officer may get his moments to shine, eventually in the show.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Verdict:</strong></h3>

<p>Going by the first two episodes of Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo, there certainly is something interesting that is brewing but the episodes in question leave a lot left to be desired. The premise and the setting is the driving force and that is what keeps one hooked onto the show just a bit longer. You can watch Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo now streaming on Disney+ Hostsar.</p>

Radhika Bakshi (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-alaya-f-on-being-called-bollywoods-next-superstar-by-priyanka-chopra-there-is-no-better-feeling-1218171">Alaya F</a>), a free spirited journalist, finds herself in deep trouble when the news story that she has been working on for months,&nbsp;related to the illegal u-turns on the NTPC flyover, is linked to the suspicious deaths of those who break the rules, within 24 hours of the rule-break. The series of events ahead, reveal the driving force behind Radhika taking up such a vague story and what has led to the deaths of almost a dozen individuals, for their rule break.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Works:</strong><br />
Clocking in at just around 100 minutes, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/u-turn-2023">U-Turn</a>&nbsp;is very crisp and compact. It is paced well and is gripping too, barring a couple of instances where the writing could have been slightly better.</p>

<p>The film&#39;s unpredictability is its biggest strength. When you know that you are getting a hang of it, it surprises you with something that changes your views on the matter, completely. The suspense of the film is well kept and the finale is satisfying too. Those who haven&#39;t watched the Kannada original or the Telugu remake, may enjoy watching the Hindi version.</p>

<p>The smart use of elements like supernaturalism deserve a special mention. Although much of the film is derived, I, as a first hand viewer, enjoyed how the film very well balanced different elements that go into making a good, commercial thriller.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Doesn&#39;t:</strong><br />
There are instances where the writing could have been better. Few scenes, if written better, could really help in creating a greater overall impact.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances:</strong><br />
Alaya F as Radhika Bakshi gives a formidable performance. She plays her role of a journalist with great finesse. She shines in intense scenes and commands a good screen presence.</p>

<p>Priyanshu Painyuli as investigating officer Arun Sinha is very convincing. He is sharp and lends great support.</p>

<p>Ashim Gulati as Radhika&#39;s love interest, Aditya Iyer, has an interesting role and he does well.</p>

<p>The pick of the actors is Manurishi Chadha as inspector Indrajeet Singh Dhillon. He gives a knockout performance and really makes the climax a whole lot impactful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>On the whole, U-Turn is a well paced film with a gripping narrative and good acting performances. There are a few minor issues with the writing at a few instances but&nbsp;it is surely worth a watch for those who haven&#39;t watched the original film.</p>

<p>Salman Khan plays his character with ease, and shines in the action and dance sequences, however its overall impact is limited. Pooja Hegde really shines in her role of Bhagya, which has the right mix of quirks, entertainment, humour, charm and emotions. She portrays all of it and more, effortlessly in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-shehnaaz-gill-on-the-difference-between-salman-khan-in-bigg-boss-and-on-a-film-set-hes-the-same-1217633">Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan</a>. Daggubati Venkatesh lives up to his part, and his pivotal sequence in the end is worth the hoots. Jagapathi Babu lights up the screen every time he appears, while Vijender Singh&rsquo;s track is monotonous and boring, which also impacts the strength of his performance. Bhumika Chawla, Raghav Juyal, Jassie Gill, Siddharth Nigam, Rohini Hattangadi, Satish Kaushik, Shehnaaz Gill, Palak Tiwari and Vinali Bhatnagar lend able support, but some of them get overshadowed because of their limited screen time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t lose out on anything if you give it a miss.</p>

<p>IPS officer Diana (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/tabu">Tabu</a>) seizes a truck loaded with Rs 1000 crore worth of cocaine owned by a&nbsp;drug lord, Ashwathama (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/deepak-dobriyal">Deepak Dobriyal</a>). A series of events&nbsp;puts a prisoner, Bholaa (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/ajay-devgn">Ajay Devgn</a>) in the midst of this fight between the cops and the gangsters. Bholaa shoulders the responsibility of saving the police community from the wrath of the drug lord, in lieu of getting support from&nbsp;the cops to ensure the well-being of his daughter. Does he succeed in doing so? All the action, drama and thrill will unfold when you watch Bholaa.</p>

<p><strong>What Works:</strong></p>

<p>The Ajay Devgn starrer is loaded with brilliantly choreographed action sequences which are sure to induce goosebumps. There are certain elevations that his character has got through the course of the film which stand out in the narrative. Watch out for the Trishul combat scene and the pre-interval block, which act&nbsp;as the main highlights of the film.</p>

<p>The prolonged 6-minute bike chase sequence also keeps you on the edge of your seat and speaks volumes about Devgn&rsquo;s calibre as a director to pull off a sleek action scene with conviction. Tabu&rsquo;s entry sequence is also well designed.</p>

<p>The film has been paced well in first half, but there are moments in the second half that feel&nbsp;like a slog through the course of its modest runtime. The story is easy to follow, but also predictable. Ajay doesn&#39;t disappoint on the directorial front and is mostly in control of the subject matter as a director, however the screenplay could have been better. The comic portions are decent.</p>

<p><strong>What Doesn&#39;t:</strong></p>

<p>The pace in the second half dips and the relatively weak screenplay is saved by some well-designed action sequences. The flashback episodes are rushed through and they don&#39;t add much depth to the story. It&rsquo;s a&nbsp;new dimension added to the story from the Tamil Original, however, the mediocre presentation doesn&#39;t help establish a strong emotional connect that is required for a film of this sort. You don&rsquo;t root for the character of Bholaa through his journey. The daughter emotion also doesn&rsquo;t hit the right note.</p>

<p>The dialogues lack the punch that a mass-oriented film like Bholaa should ideally have. Slightly better work on this front would have helped significantly. Although the film has been marketed as a 3D film, it doesn&#39;t really add much to it. The effects aren&#39;t many and aren&#39;t really significant enough to command a watch in the 3D format. The close-up shots of the actors aren&rsquo;t pleasing on the eyes, especially in 3D. The climax action too could have been better.</p>

<p><strong>Performances:</strong></p>

<p>Ajay Devgn essays his role of Bholaa very well. He has great body language and commands a solid screen presence. His confrontation sequences with the villains are among the major highlights. He aces the action sequences like a boss. Bholaa is yet another strong performance in Ajay Devgn&#39;s illustrious filmography.</p>

<p>Tabu plays the role of an IPS officer very sincerely. She makes good use of her acting range and delivers a formidable performance. Deepak Dobriyal delivers a knockout performance. He is exceptional as Ashwathama. His performance is riveting and he deserves numerous accolades.</p>

<p>Gajraj Rao and every other supporting actor lends good support, however, it&rsquo;s Sanjay Mishra who stands out from the ensemble. There&#39;s a special surprise cameo as well to watch out for.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>Bholaa primarily rides on well-designed action scenes directed tactfully by Ajay Devgn and his team. It has presented the &#39;Mass Maharaja&#39; just as he deserves to be presented though the adaptation warranted a better screenplay and pacing in the second half. It makes for big screen watch for action lovers and Ajay Devgn fans.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to dislike in Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar. While the first half will appeal to the youth, the second half will find appreciation from the families. The film could have been shorter by about 5 - 7 minutes, but that isn&rsquo;t really a major issue to complain about as one will leave the auditorium with a smile on their faces.</p>

<h4><strong>Performances</strong></h4>

<p>Ranbir Kapoor returns to the rom-com space and aces it like a boss. His comic timing is to the point and he doesn&rsquo;t miss a single punch. Through the years, we have spoken about how his eyes and facial expressions reflect emotions, but in Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, they evoke humorous moments too. From the first frame to the last, it&rsquo;s an out and out Ranbir Kapoor show. He will make the guys aspire to be like him and ensure that the girls dream of their Mr. Perfect to be as charismatic as he is. Shraddha Kapoor also makes an appearance on screen after a long time and it&rsquo;s a delight to watch her. She is at her ease as an actor, and get&rsquo;s her moments to shine. This is probably the best introductory scene of her career and by the end of TJMM, you wonder why Shraddha isn&rsquo;t seen often on the screen. This can qualify to be her best act till date Anubhav Singh Bassi makes a formidable debut, and is among the surprise packages of the film. He does well not just in comedies but also the emotional moments. His chemistry with Ranbir is heart-warming. Dimple Kapadia also gets a chance to touch upon her comic side and bring in laughter at frequent intervals. Her expressions in the climax are hilarious. Boney Kapoor makes a confident acting debut with Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, and get&rsquo;s a character that&rsquo;s closer to his real self. &nbsp;Watch out for his &lsquo;driving dialogue&rsquo; in the climax &ndash; it&rsquo;s sure to bring out laughs. Jatinder Kaur gets some funny one-liners, whereas Inayat Verma has an adorable screen presence. Two cameos come across as the surprise package in the 2nd half.</p>

<h5><strong>Verdict:</strong></h5>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that comes together in Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar, which makes it a supremely entertaining romantic comedy driven by family emotions. The first half sets the base whereas the conflict beautifully comes together in the second half, with the final 30 minutes in itself warranting a repeat watch. The marriage of modern love story with the Indian family values is what makes Luv Ranjan&rsquo;s story a unique big screen entertainer. Go for it!</p>

<p>While the first half of Selfiee is an entertaining affair, the humour dries down in the second half as the story switches it&rsquo;s base to drama. The conflict of Selfiee (much like Driving License) is too small to be woven into a 2 and a half hour long feature film. This results in the second half being dragged with some prolonged confrontations between the two leads. The sequence of driving license test does nothing but adds on to the runtime, whereas the finale act too doesn&rsquo;t land as well as expected. Thankfully, the 10 minutes, once the conflict is resolved is delightful and brings about a laughter. It ensures that you leave cinema halls with a smile.</p>

<p>Another issue with Selfiee for the general audience might be what worked for us in the first half. While the humour is point on, it&rsquo;s too industry driven and some might be disconnected with this zone of humour. &nbsp;The music isn&rsquo;t in sync with the world of the film, and the story probably warranted better situations for the songs. Main Khiladi Tu Anari is however a fun dance number towards the end credit.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Akshay Kumar shines as Vijay Kumar. He brings in a certain aura and charm to the on-screen character of a superstar. It was absolute fun to see him mouth those quirky one-liners after a long time. Selfiee is yet another film where Akshay wins over with his comic time, specially in the first half, and makes us wait to see him in an out and out mad cap entertainer. Emraan Hashmi is sincere as Om Prakash Aggarwal, and stands tall in front of Akshay&rsquo;s personality. He has those elements of a die-hard fan, and hence the rage seems believable to a certain point. Abhimanyu Singh is a riot and a prime example of anti-casting. It&rsquo;s a surprise to see the actor in a comic avatar as through the years, we have just seen him playing a gangster from small town in most of the films. Nushrratt Bharuccha and Diana Penty make a brief appearance in the film, and are fine in their respective parts. The rest of the ensemble do well in their respective roles.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Selfiee is a one time watch that has entertaining elements in the first half with drama taking over in the second hour of the film. Watch it to get the shades of the witty Akshay Kumar side by side a sincere Emraan Hashmi. The Raj Mehta directorial has promising moments at regular intervals, but certainly warranted a better and tighter second half. The film&#39;s theatrical prospects will be limited as the conflict appears to be&nbsp; too small for a big screen watch in today&#39;s enviornment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First things first &ndash; Farzi is not as impactful as Family Man. While the premise does work as a standalone film, it falls a little short of expectations for the fans of Family Man. While the plot is fresh and sub-tracks are inline with what they want to convey, it is stretched with some of the emotional episodes expanding far beyond what the subject warranted. The impact of the series would have been a lot better if the entire conflict was packaged as a 6-episode series, rather than the conventional 8-episode approach. Farzi starts with a bang as the opening two episodes lay the platform to explode, but the pace dips from episode number 3 to episode number 5. There are certain instances that get repetitive and the director duo take too much time before introducing the catalyst, Mansoor, into the lives of Sunny and Firoz.</p>

<p>The cat and mouse race intensifies with the 6th episode, but until then, there is a possibility of losing some interest and one just waits for some adrenaline rush in the screenplay. The entire romantic track of Sunny and Megha (Raashii Khanna) is seen in multiple thrillers and lacks the spice to keep one on the edge of their seat. The final 20 minutes could have been better, with the story getting a proper closure, but it seems, the team is keen to take Sunny and Firoz on another adventure ride with Mansoor and Micheal in the second season.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Farzi isn&rsquo;t just a cat and mouse race between the characters, but also their actors to be at their best. Once again, Shahid Kapoor makes a statement on why he is among the best actors of the country, as he leaves a mark with his act as Sunny. He starts off as an underdog, but slowly and steadily transforms himself into a man full of himself. Watch out for the subdued emotional outburst at multiple occasions &ndash; there are times when Shahid lets his eyes do the talking. He is simply fantastic as Sunny. Vijay Sethupathi also makes a powerful digital debut and aces his character of Micheal. What works beautifully is his seamless style of mouthing those sarcastic one-liners as that lends a unique arc to his character. Theirs is a sense of heroism in the way he carries himself through the series without trying too hard. Kay Kay Menon as Mansoor too gets his moments to shine but the best as an actor is kept for the finale. Bhuvan Arora as Firoz is the find of Farzi and one will hear his name frequently in the times to come by. If Shahid carries Farzi on his shoulders, Bhuvan is the one supporting him to ensure that nothing goes wrong. Zakir Hussain is a riot as Minister Pawan Gahlot, and the actor uses his craft to validate the madness happening around him. Raashii Khanna too gets an author backed character, playing RBI Officer, Megha Vyas, and is confident through her presence in the series. Her interactions with Vijay Sethupathi are among the major highlights. Amol Palekar as Nanu is delightful. He is outrightly natural in his dialogue delivery and brings a smile to your face with his mere presence. The rest of the ensemble cast do well in their respective roles.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Farzi is a tentpole cat and mouse chase between the right and the wrong done right keeping the Indian template of story telling intact. Despite the drag moments from episode 3 to 5, the series has enough due to its dialogues, performances and fresh plot to hold attention and make for a good thrilling watch for the audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National Award winning filmmaker <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/rajkumar-santoshi-claims-receiving-threats-ahead-of-gandhi-godse-ek-yudh-release-seeks-police-protection-1207038">Rajkumar Santoshi</a> returns to direction after 10 years with Gandhi Godse Ek Yudh, a story that is based on conflicting ideologies. The movie is a fictional narrative focussing on Mahatma Gandhi, who survives Nathuram Vinayak Godse&rsquo;s attack, and soon after his recovery, expresses his desire to meet the latter in prison. Despite Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi&rsquo;s efforts, Godse refuses to accept Gandhi&rsquo;s views. However, a while later, the duo end up sharing the same prison cell, where both indulge into several debates and exchange of thoughts with an attempt to understand each other&rsquo;s perspectives. Whether they finally reach that point, is for you to see in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Works?</strong></p>

<p>What works the best for me in Gandhi Godse Ek Yudh is the visual presentation of the film, and full credit for it should go to director Rajkumar Santoshi, cinematographer Rishi Punjabi, and production designer Dhananjay Mondal. Some of the wide shot scenes filmed in the jail, and in the village sequence are canned beautifully.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the first half of the film takes you on a roller coaster ride, which begins with intrigue, then a few questions, then some confusion, and by the time it reaches the interval point, it gives clarity on what the film is trying to achieve. This transition, though not the best form of narrative, keeps you hooked to the subject. Rajkumar Santoshi&rsquo;s screenplay manages to keep you engaged in these first 60 minutes, however, it is the second half where the film falters. More on it, in the next section. AR Rahman&rsquo;s background score helps to lift up scenes, which are struggling to make an impact on their own merit. The end message is also really noble and important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Doesn&rsquo;t Work?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>What doesn&rsquo;t work for me are the approx 30 to 40 minutes post the interval, which seemed like an unnecessary stretch. The filmmaker here is trying to explain and elaborate on the nature and perspectives of both his central characters, however, this portion could have definitely been brought down by 10 minutes. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kesari-did-no-justice-to-battle-of-saragarhi-rajkumar-santoshi-reveals-not-getting-enough-support-1206791">Rajkumar Santoshi</a> and Editor A. Sreekar Prasad could have focused a bit more on sharpening the second half of Gandhi Godse Ek Yudh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the overall script seems a little stretched, not in terms of its run time, but in the scope of the story itself. Dialogues penned by Asghar Wajahat and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/rajkumar-santoshi">Rajkumar Santoshi</a> are also forgettable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Deepak Antani truly wins your heart with his performance as Mahatma Gandhi. Throughout the movie, his performance is extremely subtle yet hugely impactful. For me, he is the highlight of the whole film. Chinmay Mandlekar as Nathuram Godse is also equally impressive. He has delivered a very controlled performance, and has maintained that throughout the project. Pawan Chopra as Jawaharlal Nehru is splendid, while the rest of the cast too have played their parts to the T.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, the movie has some memorable performances but is let down by a weak screenplay and a stretched storyline.</p>

<p>Pathaan is a typical Siddharth Anand film and hence, follows the template of a typical spy film. Instead of focusing on a singular mission, the conflict keeps shifting at regular intervals without a proper closure in some cases, which is a minor drawback. The sequences that indicate an underlying element of romance between SRK and Deepika lead to a dip in the pace and divert from the core plot. The dialogues by Abbas Tyrewala could have been slightly better, and the same can be said for the VFX too, which is a little dodgy at some instances, especially the aerial sequences. But yet, full marks to the direction team for their ambition and dreaming big to put out an action film that can actually compete with the ones made in the West.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances:</strong></h3>

<p>Pathaan belongs to a man named Shah Rukh Khan. It took him 32 years to do an out-and-out action film of this scale and he aces the character from the word go. The way he laughs the way he beats up the antagonists, to his own charismatic way of winning over the people around &ndash; it&rsquo;s SRK show all the way. John Abraham is the surprise package of the film and his character arc gives him the opportunity to display varied shades of emotions. &nbsp;He is fantastic as Jim and this performance is among the most memorable, taking us back to the days of Dhoom. Deepika Padukone as Rubina gets a character that shifts gears at regular intervals to build intrigue in the plot. Seldom has a female protagonist got the chance to do so much action in a feature film, and Deepika is here to make a statement that if given the opportunity, she can pull off some serious kicks and punches. The future of the spy universe with female protagonists is in safe hands with Deepika and of course, Katrina Kaif (Zoya).</p>

<p>Dimple Kapadia leave an impact with her character of JOCR chief whereas Ashutosh Rana takes from where it all ended in War. Salman Khan is outstanding in his cameo as Tiger, and the appearance raises anticipation for Tiger 3. The rest of the ensemble do well in their respective roles.</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h3>

<p>Pathaan has all the ingredients that are needed in a Hindi Film to emerge as a BLOCKBUSTER. It has action, scale, emotion, and music alongside the presence of Superstar Shah Rukh Khan, who is presented as a larger-than-life Superstar in a feature film after a while. Pathaan is ready to set the box office on fire and is also on a mission to create new records not just on the opening front but also in the long run. It&rsquo;s a BONDAFIDE BLOCKBUSTER in the making and also sets up the YRF Spy Universe in a big way with Tiger, Kabir, and Pathaan!</p>

<p>After stalling India&rsquo;s attempt to become a nuclear power in 1974, Pakistan illegally imports raw materials to make itself a nuclear nation, keeping it a secret from rest of the world. On getting an intel from undercover agents, India activates it&rsquo;s RAW network in Pakistan to stop their mission to become a nuclear power. The mission is led by Tariq aka. Amandeep Singh (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/sidharth-malhotra">Sidharth Malhotra</a></strong>), who takes personal interest in the same to let go of the baggage of being a traitor due to his father&rsquo;s dishonesty with the nation. Tariq is joined by fellow undercover agents in Pakistan in the Mission Majnu, a name derived due to the fact that Tariq is indeed in love with a Pakistani girl named, Nasreen (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/rashmika-mandanna">Rashmika Mandanna</a></strong>). Will India be able to expose Pakistan&rsquo;s illegal activity at global forum? That&rsquo;s what Mission Majnu is all about</p>

<h2><strong>What Works</strong>?</h2>

<p>Mission Majnu is a sincere attempt to make a film on a lesser-known event from Indian history, though the makers have given it a fictional spin for varied reasons. The subject chosen is fascinating and has limited elements of adrenaline rush with characters racing against time to succeed in their mission. The final 25 to 30 minutes is the high point of the film, and the closing sequence touches your heart. The performances by Sidharth Malhotra, Sharib Hashmi and Kumud Mishra bring in the right amount of energies that the subject warrants.</p>

<p>The music gels well into the narrative, though album doesn&rsquo;t have any chartbuster track. The writing by Aseem Arora, Sumit Batheja and Parveez Shaikh doesn&rsquo;t divulge much from the core conflict of the film, but the novelty factor is missing all through the screenplay. Mission Majnu slips into the mode of a mission from the first frame, without wasting much of the time in creating the world, thereby keeping the runtime under check.</p>

<h2><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-will-sidharth-malhotra-only-stick-to-biopics-after-shershaahs-success-he-tells-1206638">Mission Majnu</a></strong> isn&rsquo;t dramatic enough. While the core plot has the vibe of the leads racing against time, the film doesn&rsquo;t have those dramatic high points to keep you on the edge of your seat. A film on this subject probably warranted a larger dose of nationalistic scenes, to amp up the overall impact of the film towards the end. The love story of Sidharth Malhotra and Rashmika Mandanna is a little undercooked, whereas the means to crack the mission by the lead character seems far too convenient. The character doesn&rsquo;t have enough challenges to accomplish the mission. The thrill through the journey is also missing, and comes into picture in the final 25 minutes. Even the victory of Sidharth Malhotra to rub off the tag of traitor doesn&rsquo;t entail an element of win. A similar sub-track in Chak De India is a perfect example of how to redeem a character.</p>

<p>The production values, especially the set design, which does seem artificial. The subject had lot of potential, but, an attempt to keep the approach real (with a little unbelievable route) dented it&rsquo;s prospects. The film doesn&rsquo;t have any memorable dialogues.</p>

<h2><strong>Performances</strong></h2>

<p>Sidharth Malhotra does well in his character of an on field RAW officer, Tariq. His character has an arc of redemption, and he shifts from one emotional turmoil to the other with ease. He also brings an element of calm to the character. Rashmika Mandanna doesn&rsquo;t have much to do on the performance front, but, has a good chemistry with Sidharth Malhotra. Kumud Mishra is promising as an undercover agent, whereas Sharib Hashmi makes another confident appearance with a tich of humour to the role. Parmeet Sethi, Zakir Hussain and Rajit Kapoor do well in their respective brief appearance.</p>

<h2><strong>Verdict</strong></h2>

<p>Mission Majnu is an average film, whose plot had the potential to be the next SherShaah but doesn&rsquo;t reach it&rsquo;s peak due to restrained approach on drama, thrill and patriotism.</p>

<p>Director Tejas Prabhaa Vijay Deoskar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rakul-preet-singhs-chhatriwali-takes-the-digital-route-to-release-on-this-date-1199379">Chhatriwali</a> is set in Karnal, and revolves around Sanya Dhingra (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/people-didnt-want-to-cast-me-in-girl-next-door-roles-after-rakul-preet-singh-exclusive-1206710">Rakul Preet Singh</a>) - a chemistry teacher, who is looking for a full time job to help her financially struggling family to sustain. As luck would have it, she soon gets an offer from Ratan Lamba (Satish Kaushik) to be the quality control head at his condom company, a role she hesitantly takes up because of the taboos and perception attached to the product. However, as she eventually understands the importance of her job and truly accepts the role, it unfortunately invites a plethora of problems in her personal life. How she battles that, while also championing a larger cause is what Chhatriwali is all about.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Hot?</h2>

<p>While it is extremely important for the first scene of the movie to grab the viewer&#39;s attention, it is equally crucial for it to give a sneak peek into what to expect in the remaining minutes, while also setting the tone of the film. Tejas Prabhaa Vijay Deoskar, Ronnie Screwvala and ZEE5 film&rsquo;s opening sequence does just that. It starts off brilliantly with a situational comedy set-up that immediately pulls you into the world of Chhatriwali, and maintains that tone throughout the project. The biggest hero of this Rakul Preet Singh and Sumeet Vyas starter is its story and screenplay written by Sanchit Gupta and Priyadarshee Srivastava.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social comedies often face criticism for being preachy, however Chhatriwali manages to avoid that path by being entertaining and also conveying the message strongly. It not only deals with wrong perceptions around condom and sex education, but also delves into topics like stereotype, equality or rather lack of it, and on the difference between education and literacy. I have always believed they are two different things and is highlighted subtly with Rajesh Tailang&rsquo;s character Rajan Kalra aka Bhai Ji. He is a biology teacher who is struggling to accept simple science because of societal norms and age-old practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The writer&rsquo;s play up on many dichotomic features of his and many other characters in the film, which adds an interesting layer to the narrative. Kudos to the writers for penning this story, and to the director Tejas Prabhaa Vijay Deoskar for bringing that alive on the screen. Cinematographer Siddharth Vasani&rsquo;s camerawork adds impact to the scenes, while production designer Swapnali Das has stayed true to the milieu of the project. Casting by Abhishek Banerjee and Anmol Ahuja is bang on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, while watching the movie I often thought about Shoojit Sircar&rsquo;s Ayushmann Khurrana and Yami Gautam starrer Vicky Donor. No, Chhatriwali&rsquo;s story is not similar to the 2012 film, and is absolutely original. But it does deal with a taboo subject as sensitively and effortlessly as Vicky Donor did. So kudos to the team for that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Not?</h2>

<p>In an attempt to put forth a larger point, the writers somewhat underplay the importance of trust in a relationship. That one portion between Sanya and Rishi Kalra (Sumeet Vyas) seems like a convenient path chosen by the writers to take their message forward, which is a let down for the overall sincerity in the narrative. The last 15 minutes of the film also loses pace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another let down of Chhatriwali is its background score composed by Mangesh Dhakde as there is an inconsistency in its desired impact. Songs, created by different composers, too are not memorable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Performances</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-video-rakul-preet-singh-recalls-being-replaced-thrice-in-initial-days-of-career-they-wanted-a-star-1206708">Rakul Preet Singh</a> plays her part to the T, effortlessly showcasing her journey from ignorance to acceptance. Sumeet Vyas brings Rishi Kalra alive on the screen, and is there anything that Dolly Ahluwalia, Rajesh Tailang, and Satish Kaushik can&rsquo;t really play? Prachee Shah Paandya is good as Nisha Kalra, but I believe she has the potential to play more layered characters. Rakesh Bedi in his limited screen time as Madan Chacha stands out.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, despite a few odds, Chhatriwali manages to entertain and is also able to convey a strong message with impact. Now, it&rsquo;s rare for a film to pull that off, so I would highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aasmaan Bhardwaj&rsquo;s caper - <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/kuttey">Kuttey</a> - is largely driven by a common human emotion, which is greed and the never ending lust for money. It begins with Gopal (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-arjun-kapoor-on-kuttey-and-shahid-kapoor-priyanka-chopra-starrer-kamineys-crossover-can-happen-1206023">Arjun Kapoor</a>) and Paaji (Kumud Mishra) landing themselves into trouble, their attempt to bail out of it - and while they are at it, the destiny entagles them with a few more characters and a van loaded with money - which to them looks like a solution for all their problems. Do they truly manage to find a way out, or does Narayan Khobre (Naseeruddin Shah), Pammi (Tabu), Laxmi (Konkona Sensharma), Lovely (Radhika Madan) and Danny&rsquo;s (Shardul Bhardwaj) interest and interference lead them all in a fierce situation? Watch the film to find out!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Hot?</h2>

<p>What truly works for me in this Bhushan Kumar, Luv Ranjan and Vishal Bhardwaj backed movie is its last 20 minutes. While the film struggles to get you invested in the first half, it picks up pace in the latter portion of the film, especially when it accelerates towards the climax. All the pieces truly begin to come together as the film gravitates towards its end, only to fall apart once again in the finale. This sudden momentum in the narrative keeps you on the edge, while making you wonder about the lack of it in the initial portion of the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, the overall treatment of the film is unique, impactful and rare in the Hindi film space, and kudos to director and writer Aasmaan Bhardwaj for pulling that off. Yes, the concept of greed, ambition and betrayal isn&rsquo;t new, but it has been packaged in a way which sets the story apart. Dialogues penned by Vishal Bhardwaj stand out. Like Konkona&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sirf Tum Aur Tumhara Malik Desh Nahin Hai, Hum Bhi Hai&rsquo; makes you think, and few one liners like Tabu&rsquo;s commentary on men, will crack you up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another highlight of Kuttey is its music and background score composed by Vishal Bhardwaj. When a few scenes struggle to hold your attention in the first half, it is the BGM which helps it hold its ground. Music is top notch as well, and has the potential to eventually grow on the audience. My personal favourite from the album is &ldquo;Tere Saath&rdquo;, which is penned by Gulzar, and sung by Vishal Bhardwaj and Kiran and Nivi. It is as soulful as it can get. Director of Photography (DOP) Farhad Ahmed Dehlvi&rsquo;s lens brings the world of Kuttey alive, production designers Amit Ray and Subrata Chakraborty stay true to the look and feel of Kuttey, and costume designer Karishma Sharma too has done justice with her and the director&rsquo;s apparel vision for the characters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Not?</h2>

<p>What doesn&rsquo;t work in the favour of the film is its elongated screenplay. All the characters in Kuttey are quirky, and the narrative takes its own sweet time to establish their individual features, while also taking the story forward. This sometimes makes the viewer impatient for what&rsquo;s to follow. Furthermore, Ashish Vidyarthi&rsquo;s character adds nothing to the overall story, and that whole part alongwith Tabu&rsquo;s frog and scorpion story could have been completely eliminated. Maybe, another way could have been found to establish what that scene wanted to convey, because the existing one is long and pompous. Editor A. Sreekar Prasad could have helped screenplay writer Aasmaan Bhardwaj and additional screenplay writer Vishal Bhardwaj in sharpening these portions. Action choreographed by Harpal Singh and Anton Moon looks caricaturish.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Performances</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/arjun-kapoor-opens-up-on-upcoming-film-kuttey-hope-people-will-love-freshness-of-the-story-1203969">Arjun Kapoor</a> gives a sincere performance as Gopal, and is able to convey the emotions through his craft. Tabu, Konkona Sensharma, Kumud Mishra deliver a very controlled performance that speaks volumes of their experience and expertise as actors. Naseeruddin Shah leaves an impact in his limited screen time, while Radhika Madan and Shardul Bhardwaj shine as their respective characters. In fact, Radhika&rsquo;s growth as an actress is truly remarkable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, Kuttey does entertain and enthral, but in parts. The film was capable of a lot more and doesn&rsquo;t optimise its potential.</p>

<p>Govinda (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/vicky-kaushal">Vicky Kaushal</a></strong>) is married to Gauri (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/bhumi-pednekar">Bhumi Pednekar</a></strong>) but has an extra-marital affair with Suku&nbsp;(<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/kiara-advani">Kiara Advani</a></strong>). The love triangle sees a new dimension when Govinda&rsquo;s step brother and step mother come into picture to claim the bungalow that was registered in the name of their father. The property dispute leads to murders and even theft. But who is behind the murder? The questions are answered in Govinda Naam Mera.</p>

<p><strong>What works?</strong></p>

<p>There are some moments in Govinda Naam Mera which spikes interest and takes you into the complicated world of Govinda Waghmare. The final 20 minutes of the film, where all the stories unwind themselves to come together is done nicely and leaves an impact. The film rides on good ensemble cast &ndash; right from Vicky Kaushal to Kiara Advani, Bhumi Pednekar, Amey Wagh, Sayaji Shinde, Dayanand Shetty, Viraj Ghelani and Renuka Shahane &ndash; and the presence of these actors keeps your hope in the story intact.</p>

<p>There are some comic gags and one-liners, especially the ones with Amey Wagh, that bring a smile on your face. The Bijli song is peppy and Ranbir Kapoor&rsquo;s cameo is refreshing.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></p>

<p>Govinda Naam Mera rides on a rather flat narrative. While the film has an interesting climax, director Shashank Khaitan doesn&rsquo;t carve an interesting path to reach the climax episode. His characters are poorly written, as you don&rsquo;t root for the protagonist, Govinda, at any point of time. While the humour works in a couple of scenes, there isn&rsquo;t enough in the story to bring about laughs at regular interval.</p>

<p>Some of the sub-plots are infused in the narrative to create the intrigue, but they rather act as a distraction. The cast is filled with seasoned actors, but most are not utilized well. The narrative of the film is so flat, that nothing really happens in the first half and the thriller element actually kicks in at the half way mark. Govinda Naam Mera is a film where you keep anticipating some conflicts, scene after scene, but the closure of the sequences leave you wanting for more. The story required bigger conflicts and better humour for the finale to leave an impact.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Govinda Naam Mera marks Vicky Kaushal&rsquo;s foray into what could be termed a commercial comic thriller and the actor does well to play his part of Govinda, though he does look uncomfortable in a couple of shots. With the right film, Vicky could get comfortable in the space of the commercial Hindi cinema potboilers. Kiara Advani delivers in a big way and certainly stands out from the rest with her act in the film. The entire cinematic episode of her in the jail is among the best scenes of the film. Bhumi Pednekar does well as a dominating wife, but the character doesn&rsquo;t have enough shades. Amey Wagh is a riot as a lawyer, in-fact, some of his antiques remind us of Ritesh Deshmukh in the world of Housefull. Viraj Ghelani is decent, whereas Jeeva has some hilarious moments in the over-the-top character of a musician. Renuka Shahane is wasted, same can be said for Sayaji Shinde and Dayanand Shetty. Ranbir Kapoor is charming in his cameo.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Govinda Naam Mera rides on a rather flat narrative where nothing really comes together apart from the final 20 minutes, which has an element of surprise in the twists and turns. The film tries to balance itself by bringing the world of commercial comedy and dark comedy together, but ends up being neither of the two.</p>

<p>Taapsee Pannu is inarguably one of the finest actors that the Hindi cinema has, and with each scene, she exudes conviction.

Even with his silence, he left a mark in the movie with his brief yet pivotal role. Kruttika Desai&rsquo;s guest appearance is the turning point of the story and Abhilash Thapliyal is a surprise element to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final-verdict</strong></p>

<p>This genre has a very niche audience and is definitely not for the faint-hearted.</p>

<p>Heading into the screening for Salaam Venky, I mentally prepared myself for the recurring tears to spill, and I was not disappointed. Not leaving its audience time to breathe, the Revathi directorial begins with Venky being taken out of the ambulance with an anxious Sujata in tow. While Sujata frets over her ill son, Venky uses&nbsp;dark humour to diffuse the heightened tensions. This oscillation between comedy and drama is the driving force of Salaam Venky.</p>

<p>When it comes to the performances, Kajol and Vishal Jethwa conjure up so much earnestness into their on-screen real-life characters, it&#39;s endearing and heartbreaking to watch on the big screen. We&#39;re used to an overdramatic Kajol in movies, but in Salaam Venky, the actress is put to the test with a more restrained act, and unsurprisingly, she delivers in spades. The constant rigmarole of emotions Sujata survives through is not easy to watch. On the other hand, Vishal infuses the&nbsp;charming essence into a disabled&nbsp;Venky but also gets overindulgent in the dramatics of it all. As for the supporting cast,&nbsp;Rajeev Khandelwal, Riddhi Kumar and Priyamani as Venky&#39;s doctor, love interest and sister, get their own moments to shine and they do so sincerely. P.S. Rajeev Khandelwal is such an underrated acting gem! While Aahana Kumra as the journalist supporting Venky&#39;s last wish is pretty likeable, the usually dependable Rahul Bose and Prakash Raj as Venky&#39;s lawyer and the presiding judge&nbsp;suffer from underdeveloped characters. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/aamir-khan">Aamir Khan</a>&#39;s special appearance comes at just the right &quot;twist&quot; moment, as seeing him and Kajol on the big screen is a sure treat.</p>

<p>As for Salaam Venky&#39;s&nbsp;script,&nbsp;Sammeer Arora and Kausar Munir&#39;s adapted screenplay could have inched more towards a crisper narrative, with predictable dialogues having its &quot;Ha!&quot; and &quot;Blah!&quot; moments. What also comes as a major distraction, and not the good kind, is the music by Mithoon which is mostly forgettable. The movie could have done without the &quot;Mithoon Musical&quot; factor&nbsp;as the break in narrative with lacklustre tunes distracts from the rhythm Revathi tries to set. Nevertheless, what works in kind for Salaam Venky&nbsp;is Ram Varman&#39;s cinematography, with its dominating tight &#39;character-centric&#39; shots that lets the actors, rather than the surroundings, do all the talking needed.</p>

<p>Salaam Venky rides high on emotions, and if like me, you&#39;re a softie at heart, then Revathi&#39;s movie will surely move you. There are certain scenes that will leave you weeping. You maybe even indulge in the social conversation at hand. Salaam Venky is melodramatic, dialled up to infinity, and is a heroic tale on life, death and life even after death.</p>

<h3><strong>Plus Points:</strong></h3>

<p>Kajol and Vishal Jethwa are the perfect&nbsp;choices to bring Sujata and Venky&#39;s brave, motivational&nbsp;story to the big screen. The casting of the supporting characters, especially Rajeev Khandelwal, Riddhi Kumar and Priyamani is top-notch. Aamir Khan&#39;s special appearance has emotional gravitas. Ram Varman&#39;s intimate cinematography helps elevate the heightened tensions the lead characters constantly find themselves oscillating between.</p>

<h3><strong>Minus Points:</strong></h3>

<p>Inspite of a heartfelt performance, Vishal Jethwa gets a bit too overdramatic in parts.&nbsp;Rahul Bose and Prakash Raj&#39;s characters are borderline caricaturish. Sammeer Arora and Kausar Munir&#39;s adapted screenplay has many bricks to combat through, as&nbsp;the mostly predictable dialogues don&#39;t always invoke the right&nbsp;emotions. The &quot;musical&quot; aspect ends up defeating&nbsp;the purpose of the film.</p>

<h2><strong>Highlights:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Kajol and Vishal Jethwa earnestly capture Sujata and Venky&#39;s eternal mother-son bond.</li>
	<li>Rajeev Khandelwal,&nbsp;Riddhi Kumar and Priyamani are standouts from the supporting cast.</li>
	<li>Ravi Varman&#39;s POV cinematography elevates the emotional quotient in storytelling.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>

<p>Inspite of its many obvious&nbsp;flaws, Salaam Venky tends to work its charm thanks to Kajol, Vishal Jethwa and the carefully curated supporting cast&#39;s authenticity. Keep those tissues by your side, because it&#39;s a cry fest from start to finish.</p>

<p><strong>Director:</strong> Anirudh Iyer</p>

<p><strong>Cast</strong>: Ayushmann Khurrana, Jaideep Ahlawat</p>

<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3.5 / 5</p>

<p><strong>Plot:</strong></p>

<p>Much like all absconders, India&rsquo;s biggest action hero, Manav Khurrana (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/ayushmann-khurrana">Ayushmann Khurrana</a>), escapes to London after he accidentally kills the brother of a top politician in India, to avoid the arrest by local cops. &nbsp;While Manav decides to fight his legal battle from London, believing in the power of truth, little does he know that the politician, Bhoora (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/jaideep-ahlawat">Jaideep Ahlawat</a>), has vowed to take revenge and has already arrived in London to kill him. How does Manav protect himself from the cops and the goons? Watch An Action Hero to know more</p>

<p><strong>What works?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest strength of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/an-action-hero-screening-ayushmann-khurrana-ups-his-style-game-shehnaaz-jaideep-and-others-attend-pics-1201560">An Action Hero </a>is director Anirudh Iyer&rsquo;s conviction to narrate this quirky tale of revenge in a certain way. His storytelling pattern and direction manage to hold attention all throughout the narrative. The screenplay is laced with some great one-liners and movements that take you by shock. The entire first half moves in a brisk pace, with engaging episodes, one after the other. Right from the entire style of setting up the story in India, to the airplane block with Akshay Kumar and finally, the cat-and-mouse chase between Manav, the cops, and Bhoora in London &ndash; the screenplay keeps you hooked.</p>

<p>The second half too has some solid moments, especially the climax, though, it might get varied reactions from the audience. The team has a big win on the background score front, as it&rsquo;s upbeat and in sync with the tempo and mood of the film. The action scenes too are surprisingly well-designed, well-shot, and well-written, as they are not mere additions, but actually take the story forward. One of the biggest high points of the film is the 5-minute appearance of Akshay Kumar, as that&rsquo;s sure to bring the house down with laughter. His mere expressions are enough to evoke laughter and to add to that, his dialogue parting dialogue with Ayushmann is easily among the best scenes of the year.</p>

<p><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></p>

<p>The screenplay of An Action Hero gets a little repetitive in the second half. There are certain moments, where you are forced to think, why aren&rsquo;t the characters killing each other? In fact, the film also goes off track for a brief period, but the director does well to pull all the strings and bring the story back in the grove with the extended climax. The entire underworld track doesn&rsquo;t work in the initial few frames, and the entire way of making a satire out of the current sad state of Indian media is stretched beyond imagination. While the makers are true in their projection of TRP, the entire track could have been trimmed.</p>

<p>The drawbacks would have had an edge if not for the extended climax, particularly the twist in the tale makes you look beyond some of the logical loopholes. While most of the emotions are desi and relatable, the climax might not be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, restraining the reach of the film. The reactions might be polarised to the final 30 minutes, but this one is sure to find appreciation from a large chunk of the audience post its digital release. Malaika Arora&rsquo;s dance number doesn&rsquo;t add any value to the film and is a bad recreation of an iconic song.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Ayushmann Khurrana steps into the action space for the first time and this is the most heroic he has ever looked in a film. He carries the attitude of a superstar in the initial frames and transforms his body language as the story progresses. He brings in several shades to the character and passes the test of getting into the slightly macho space with flying colors. Jaideep Ahlawat is fabulous as Bhoora and some of his straight-face dialogues define what dark comedy exactly stands for. The anger beneath him translates into some fun moments in the film. Akshay Kumar&rsquo;s cameo is hilarious to say the least and it&rsquo;s such a delight to finally see him in an urban avatar this year, doing what he does best &ndash; comedy. Jitender Hooda and Hiten Patel do well in their limited roles. The rest of the ensemble do well in their limited roles.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>An Action Hero is an intelligently written action thriller, wherein the director follows his conviction to strike the right balance in the genre with some humor and whacky scenarios. The conflict does get repetitive in the second half, but the finale saves the day for this Ayushmann Khurrana film. It&rsquo;s definitely Worth-A-Dekho this weekend.</p>

<p>Director Shashanka Ghosh&rsquo;s thriller revolves around a lovelorn Freddy (played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kartik-aaryan-on-signing-freddy-i-had-no-option-but-to-say-yes-1201564">Kartik Aaryan</a>) - an under confident dentist who is looking for his soulmate. After many failed attempts and a couple of faloodas, he finds love in an already married - Kainaaz (essayed by Alaya F), who is stuck in an unhappy marriage. Like many love stories this one too comes with its own challenges, some really unexpected ones. How this unfolds and impacts Freddy and Kainaaz&rsquo;s future is for you to see in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>What majorly works for the movie are two things - Freddy&rsquo;s character graph, which you see coming but Kartik&rsquo;s performance elevates the overall experience, and the other is the second half of the film which is gripping with the central characters experiencing a variety of emotions - resulting in many right and wrong decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While director Shashanka Ghosh has executed these twists and turns well in the last sixty minutes of the film, what further supports this linear form of narrative is Director Of Photography (DOP) Ayananka Bose&rsquo;s lens, and production designer Rajat Poddar&rsquo;s designs, which coaxes you into the world of Freddy. The sequences - both romantic and terrifying ones - shot at Freddy&rsquo;s farmhouse in Karjat look stunning on the big screen. Background score created by Clinton Cerejo helps the scenes extend its thrilling impact. Casting by Vaibhav Vishant is spot on, while action choreography by Amritpal Singh also works in the favour of the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The first half of the film, which focuses a lot on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/freddy-screening-kartik-aaryan-jay-shewakramani-arrive-in-style-at-yrf-studios-in-mumbai-watch-1201569">Freddy</a> and Kainaaz&rsquo;s romance. In a thriller, one would expect the sub genres to evolve faster, thus making space for a more nail biting follow-up narrative, which Freddy is unable to do so. Story and screenplay writer Parveez Sheikh could have focused a little more in polishing this portion. Dialogue writer Aseem Arrora has made an attempt to make the lines relatable, however his words lose their soul along the way. Music composed by Pritam doesn&rsquo;t connect too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Kartik Aaryan&rsquo;s character Freddy goes through diverse and dichotomic emotions in the film, and the actor portrays them beautifully on the silver screen. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/alaya-f">Alaya F</a> too has an interesting character arc, which she amazingly brings to life in the movie. Other supporting cast have played their parts to the T as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Freddy rides on performances and the gripping second half of the movie.</p>

<p>Set in the 1940s, writer and director Anvitaa Dutt&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/tabu-holds-babil-khan-close-at-qala-screening-triptii-dimri-slays-in-black-vijay-varma-sanya-spotted-1201368">Qala</a> revolves around Urmila Manjushree (Swastika Mukherjee) - an acclaimed classical singer with a patriarchal mindset - who trains her daughter Qala Manjushree (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-triptii-dimri-excited-to-work-with-ranbir-kapoor-in-animal-reveals-what-she-learnt-from-him-1201343">Triptii Dimri</a>) in the art but is never completely satisfied with the latter&rsquo;s efforts, skill and talent. She is soon distracted by Jagan Batwal (Babil Khan) - a local boy from Solan - who she discovers at a musical presentation, and takes him under her wings with big plans sketched out for her young protegee. This development makes Qala her second priority, and what follows will take you on a roller coaster of emotions and a few lessons too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>I have always admired movies that go beyond the classic three-act structure of narrative, and dives further into minor yet important aspects of the characters and their lives - thus offering the audience an opportunity to take certain thoughts back home with them. Qala is one such film. While on the face it is about ambition, passion and jealousy, it also delves into other pivotal topics such as mental health, impact of wrong parenting, casting couch, unfortunate sacrifices that come along with aspiration, and struggles faced by women. These subjects are finely weaved together thus offering a thought provoking content for the viewers. Kudos to Anvitaa for pulling that off with grace and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While her writing and direction in Qala is top-notch, the dialogues are equally impactful, with some of the best lines mouthed by Varun Grover - who plays lyricist Majrooh Sahab in the film. His lines like, &ldquo;Raftaar Kabiliyat Ka Saboot Nahin Hoti&rdquo; and &ldquo;Daur Badlega, Daur Ki Yeh Purani Aadat Hai&rdquo; are stirring and poignant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides its literary richness, Qala is also visually stunning. They have made great use of lights - including sun rays, fireplace, and sparks that emit while welding - to elevate the emotions in the scene. Director Of Photography (DOP) Siddharth Diwan&rsquo;s emotive wide angle shots, expressive close ups, and stunning drone sequences effortlessly pulls you into the world of Qala, while production designer Meenal Agarwal&rsquo;s designs stays true to the look and feel required for the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the real hero of Qala is its music composed by Amit Trivedi and background score created by Sagar Desai. The most soothing number among the lot is Jagan&rsquo;s introductory song &ldquo;Nirbhau Nirvair&rdquo;, which is composed by Trivedi, written by Sant Kabir and Anvitaa Dutt, and voiced by Shahid Mallya. Even &ldquo;Ghodey Pe Sawaar&rdquo; featured on Qala Manjushree, written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and sung by Sireesha Bhagavatula, is a memorable track that immediately transforms you to that bygone era of simple and relatable music. Huge credit for this goes to all the lyricists, music director Amit, BGM composer Sagar, and sound designer Pritam Das.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Casting by Anmol and Abhishek (Casting Bay LLP) is spot on, while costume designer Veera Kapur EE&rsquo;s vision for the characters reflect in their interesting attires.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t really much to point out, except that there could have been a little more pace in the narrative in the first half. Anvitaa could have sharpened the screenplay a bit in that portion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>This is director Anvitaa and actor Triptii Dimri&rsquo;s second collaboration after the highly acclaimed Bulbbul, and the duo have managed to create the magic yet again. Triptii shines as Qala bringing every emotion that she goes through alive on the big screen, while Swastika Mukherjee lives the character of Urmila Manjushree. She makes the flawed mother look both real and relatable. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/qala-irrfan-khans-son-babil-khan-disapproves-of-the-word-debut-ahead-of-the-films-release-1200499">Irrfan Khan&rsquo;s son Babil</a> is truly the biggest discovery of this year, and the subtlety in his performance is an assurance of the strength of his craft, and the impact that it creates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three lead protagonists are beautifully aided by the supporting cast - including Amit Sial, Samir Kochhar, Girija Oak, Swanand Kirkire, Tasveer Kamil, Varun Grover, and Aadhya Jha, who plays the young Qala. Each one of them has portrayed their characters to the T.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Qala is literary, musically and lyrically rich - promising wholesome entertainment to the audience who are looking for quality cinema. It&rsquo;s a must watch.&nbsp;</p>

Karan Tacker plays his part fine as the IPS officer Amit Lodha, who later gets promoted to the SP&#39;s (Superintendent of police) position. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news-gossip/ravi-kishan-adds-bhojpuri-tadka-drama-companys-sets-386268">Ravi Kishan</a> (Abhyuday Singh) as the manipulative don is convincing. Avinash Tiwary as Chandan Mahto will make you forget that he was the same man in the Bollywood film, Laila Majnu. Ashutosh Rana, as usual, has made his character his second skin. Nikita Dutta as Amit Lodha&#39;s wife justifies her role.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong><br />
Neeraj Pandey is known for giving some marvellous wonders to the Indian cinema and Khakee: The Bihar Chapter could be added to it.</p>

<p>The core thought of Bhediya had ample potential to translate into something a lot bigger, especially in the second half, but the team isn&rsquo;t exactly able to take the conflict to the next level on the execution front. The director and writer take too long to give the arc of redemption to Bhaskar, which in turn doesn&rsquo;t make you root for the protagonist for a major chunk of the narrative. The core conflict of man vs human is not established well, whereas the romantic track doesn&rsquo;t spike that interest. The pre-climax episode is a bit of a drag and while the climax is a brave and out-of-box&nbsp;attempt, it doesn&rsquo;t exactly follow the conventional route to appease everyone. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Bhediya tick marks all boxes on the performance front. Varun Dhawan carries the film on his shoulders and is simply fantastic in the transformation scenes. He has cracked the formula of mouthing some one-liners with conviction and does well in the dramatic moments of the film too. Kriti Sanon has limited screen time, but her character brings in a new element to this tale as the story progresses. Abhishek Banerjee is hilarious and lifts the tempo of the film with his dialogue delivery. Paalin Kabaak gets his moment to shine in the second half, whereas Deepak Dobriyal is dependable as Panda. Saurabh Shukla doesn&rsquo;t get much scope in the narrative. Rajkummar Rao and Aparshakti Khurana&rsquo;s cameo towards the finale is a huge surprise, making you want more.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>Bhediya rides primarily on the strength of gags, visual effects, and performances, but warranted a bigger conflict with regard to a&nbsp;hero and villain in the second half. Despite the flaws, it&nbsp;makes&nbsp;for a fairly entertaining&nbsp;watch for the youth, and families, who wish to experience something unique on the big screen from the Hindi Film Industry.</p>

<p>In the first part of Drishyam, Vijay Salgaonkar (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/ajay-devgn">Ajay Devgn</a>)&nbsp;moves&nbsp;heaven and earth to save his family after they were hit by a catastrophe. While back then he managed to get away with murder quite literally, the unfortunate event comes back to haunt him after seven years in part 2 when a new IG Tarun Ahlawat (Akshaye Khanna) takes charge of the Pondolem police station, and fresh pieces of evidence come to light. As the authorities bring their A-game forward to prove the crime, the Salgaonkars go through the same trauma yet again. Will Vijay be able to safeguard their future this time as well? You&rsquo;ll have to watch the film to find out.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The best part about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/photos/drishyam-2-screening-shriya-saran-shares-passionate-kiss-with-husband-tabu-ajay-kajol-and-more-pose-pics-1199434">Drishyam 2</a> is its gripping second half, especially the last 40 minutes. This is where the whole film unravels by introducing one twist after the other. The situations are seamlessly put together making the whole sequence exciting and believable. Kudos to original Malayalam film director Jeethu Joseph for penning this story, and to Abhishek Pathak - who has helmed the Hindi version of the crime thriller - and has justified the OG version of the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is this one particular sequence of Akshaye Khanna&rsquo;s Tarun Ahlawat with Shriya Saran, Ishita Dutta and Mrunal Jadhav&rsquo;s characters which is beautifully conceptualised, delivering the necessary thrills and chills. It is aptly supported by Director of Photography (DOP) Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary&rsquo;s camera angles and Devi Sri Prasad&rsquo;s tremendous background score. Dialogues written by Aamil Keeyan Khan stand out, especially the one liners that were given to Khanna. They provided the occasional laughs, while also making a strong impact. Production Designer Tarpan Shrivastava stayed true to the characters&rsquo; milieu, and played an important role in bringing the world of Drishyam 2 alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The first half of the film doesn&rsquo;t work at all, and lacks high points. One of the most important elements of a crime-thriller is to keep the audience hooked throughout, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/drishyam-2-box-office-preview-ajay-devgn-akshaye-khanna-tabu-starrer-runtime-screen-count-opening-day-1199238">Drishyam 2</a> fails to achieve that in the first half. The inconsistency of thrill in the narrative for the first sixty minutes is the biggest drawback of this movie, and adapted screenplay writers Aamil Keeyan Khan and Abhishek Pathak could have focused a little more on sharpening this crucial part of the sequel. However, I had the same complaint with the Malayalam follow-up too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some sequences are also quite elongated, and the writers along with editor Sandeep Francis could have collaborated to fix this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>While the first part of Drishyam was unveiled in 2015, its sequel is releasing after seven years. With such a long gap, one would wonder if the actors have lost their hold over the pulse of their characters, but they haven&rsquo;t. Ajay Devgn effortlessly slips into the character of Vijay Salgaonkar, still managing to make the audience empathise with his part, despite knowing the fact that he too has committed a crime. Devgn delivers a very controlled performance, and so does Tabu, who aces every role that she takes up. Though I wish she had more screen time in this one. Akshaye Khanna has played a cop in the past too, but everytime he manages to bring a unique charm to his character, and has done that in Drishyam 2 as well. He shines in every scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shriya Saran&rsquo;s performance helps one relate to Nandini Salgaonkar&rsquo;s plight, while Ishita Dutta and Mrunal Jadhav give sincere performances as Anju and Anu respectively. Rajat Kapoor is brilliant in his limited screen time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Not having enough and expected high points in the first half of Drishyam 2 goes against the film, but it manages to cover up for that in the latter half of the movie. Watch it for all the thrill that it promises in the second half. It is also an honest adaptation of its original Malayalam version.</p>

<p>Manav Vij, Sumit Kaul, Shashank Arora, and Waluscha De Sousa play their part decently. Arbaaz Khan as the leader of the Special Task Group disappoints. The Screenplay gives scope to every artist to prove their mettle without divulging from their focal point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tanaav keeps you on the edge and builds the thrill with every passing second. It is certainly not for the faint-hearted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ambition and greed often makes one do things that would surprise, and sometimes shock you, and that is the foundation of director Vasan Bala&rsquo;s Monica, O My Darling. Jayant Arkhedkar (played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/stree-bareilly-ki-barfi-badhaai-do-and-more-rajkummar-raos-best-films-to-binge-watch-on-this-weekend-1198459">Rajkummar Rao</a>) is a classic case of rags to riches. With luck and talent by his side his time changes, and is now touted to be the future of Unicorn Group, which is owned by his to be father-in-law Satyanarayan Adhikari. However, all of this goes at stake when he gets involved in a passionate affair, which is subsequently followed by a murderous plot. This obviously invites many slip ups, unwillings actions, and a cat and mouse chase, which leads to an interesting climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>One of the most important elements in a neo-noir crime comedy thriller are the twists and turns that make you gasp along the way, and Monica, O My Darling suffices that requirement. Especially in the second half, which has enough high points to keep you on the edge of your seat. Kudos to director Vasan Bala and writer Yogesh Chandekar for pulling that off. This narrative is also aptly supported by Achint Thakkar&rsquo;s music and background score (BGM), which has a perfect mix of old world charm and contemporary tunes. Especially the BGM which reminds you of many yesteryear Hollywood detective movies. Director of photography (DOP) Swapnil Sonawane&rsquo;s tremendous close up shots shows his immense faith in the acting talent of his artists, and even brings the movie&rsquo;s world alive in association with the vision and creation of production designer Mansi Mehta.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The first half of the film develops at its own pace, and a little speed in the narrative there could have helped the movie further. In a murder-mystery, the faster the story grows the more thrill it promises, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/photos/monica-o-my-darling-screening-best-buddies-vicky-abhishek-rajkummar-and-arjun-share-a-light-moment-pics-1198443">Monica, O My Darling</a> falters a bit there in the first 45 minutes of the film. Director Vasan Bala, writer Yogesh Chandekar, and editor Atanu Mukherjee could have sharpened that portion a little more. Most of the dialogues also don&rsquo;t stand out, except the ones that have certain nostalgic references.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Rajkummar Rao has given an effortless performance as Jayant Arkhedkar, beautifully showcasing the emotional graph of the character. Akansha Ranjan Kapoor who plays his fiance lives the part, while Huma Qureshi delivers a crackling performance as Monica. Sikander Kher aces in each of his scenes, and Sukant Goel gives a very controlled performance. However, for me the star of the film is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/exclusive-radhika-apte-vasan-bala-explain-how-an-actors-image-helps-in-getting-films-behave-like-a-star-1198069">Radhika Apte</a>, who plays ACP Naidu. It seems she was having a great time playing the quirky character, and that came across on screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>If you are a fan of the neo-noir genre, then Monica, O My Darling should appeal to you. Watch it for the thrills and entertainment.</p>

<p>Uunchai is around 20 minutes longer than what it should have been. While the first half flies in no time, the pace dips in the second half. There&rsquo;s a prolonged 25-minute episode around Mr. Bachchan&rsquo;s character which goes off track and results in a dip in the narrative. The team could have made the film without that element and the impact would have been much better. Things thankfully pick up towards the finale and the climax gives you the emotional high that one warrants from a high-octane drama.</p>

<h4><strong>Performances</strong></h4>

<p>Uunchai marks the first collaboration of Amitabh Bachchan with Sooraj Barjatya and the actor has delivered a strong performance, like always. This is unlike anything he has played in the last few years as his character is full of life and has an element of self-discovery towards the end. Anupam Kher is fantastic as Om, and his character too has an arc that hasn&rsquo;t been seen in an actor from this age group. In fact, the transition of Kher&rsquo;s character is the most beautiful amongst all other counterparts. Boman Irani does well at Javed and his chemistry with Neena Gupta is heart-warming. Their romance has an old-school vibe and you can&rsquo;t help but smile through their interactions. Both the actors are apt for their roles. It&rsquo;s a delight to see Sarika on the screen and she slips into the role of Mala with perfection. Danny Denzongpa is a surprise package and there is a section of the audience who will be bowled over the purity in his smile. It&rsquo;s actually his divine presence that makes their journey to Everest even more believable. Parineeti Chopra is good in her cameo.</p>

<h5><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h5>

<p>Uunchai is a well-made film, that serves as a rooted version of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara for senior citizens. The emotions are relatable and the journey is motivating. You can&rsquo;t help but smile through the narrative and root for the characters to reach the Everest Base Camp. Some trimming is needed in the second half, but thankfully, the film has enough high points to hold attention and pack a punch. It&rsquo;s a heart-warming watch.</p>

<p><strong>Platform: </strong>Amazon Prime Video</p>

<p><strong>Rating: </strong>2 / 5</p>

<p><strong>Plot&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Taking the story forward from director Mayank Sharma&rsquo;s previous season, Avinash Sabharwal (Abhishek Bachchan) continues to struggle with his dual identity in Breathe: Into The Shadows Season 2. Just when the doctors at the medical facility are encouraged by Avinash&rsquo;s positive recovery, J (Abhishek Bachchan) resurfaces again to finish what he didn&rsquo;t earlier, and to eliminate the rest of the Ravan heads. However, this time he isn&rsquo;t alone and is accompanied by Victor (Naveen Kasturia), who helps Avinash complete his unfinished business. This resurrection doesn&rsquo;t only impact Avinash&rsquo;s family, but also turns Kabir Sawant&rsquo;s (Amit Sadh) life upside down. What happens next is for you to watch in the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>Besides the performances, the most appealing part about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/breathe-into-the-shadows-s2-trailer-abhishek-bachchan-as-j-is-back-to-complete-his-unfinished-task-watch-1196504">Breathe: Into The Shadows Season 2</a> are the action sequences choreographed by Aejaz Gulab. They are all uniquely stylized making most of the locations they are set in, and are widely different from each other. DOP (Director of Photography) S. Bharathwa&rsquo;s lens manages to bring alive the world of Breathe: Into The Shadows 2 on screen, and stays true to the look and feel of a crime thriller genre. This is aptly supported by production designer Rajiv M Panjabi&rsquo;s vision and design, which helps to elevate the overall experience of watching the show. Hair and make-up designing by Dhananjay Prajapati is on point, and especially has hit the bullseye with Abhishek&rsquo;s intense look as J.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>Besides a few twists that manage to surprise you, the overall narrative fails to engage and enthral. The story takes time to pick up speed and maintains that for the first few episodes, while none of the dialogues make an impact. Director Mayank Sharma along with fellow writers Vikram Tuli, Arshad Syed, Priya Saggi and Abhijeet Deshpande could have spent some more time sharpening the screenplay inorder to make it more gripping. The end was expected too. While music is an important element in the process of filmmaking, for crime-dramas particularly it is extremely crucial to add that required thrill in the narrative. Composer Karan Kulkarni&rsquo;s music fails to do that for Breathe: Into The Shadows Season 2.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>While the story doesn&rsquo;t manage to impress, the performances do. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/abhishek-bachchan-on-cinema-vs-ott-debate-we-are-too-obsessed-with-collections-as-opposed-to-content-1197610">Abhishek Bachchan</a> gives an honest performance, and excels especially when he plays J on the screen. Amit Sadh, Nithya Menen and Saiyami Kher remain consistently good as they were in the previous season, however the star of this season is Naveen Kasturia. He shines every time he appears on screen, and seems in total control of his act and action as an artist. A must mention for Mukesh Chhabra for this perfect casting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Breathe: Into The Shadows Season 2 had potential and shines in bits, but suffers because of an almost expected, uninspiring narrative.</p>

<p>The premise of Phone Bhoot revolves around two primary characters &ndash; Major (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/siddhant-chaturvedi">Siddhant Chaturvedi</a>) and&nbsp;Gullu (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/ishaan-khatter">Ishaan Khatter</a>)&nbsp;&ndash; who have partnered on multiple failed business ventures and now get an ultimatum from their families to be serious about life. This is when they encounter a ghost &ndash; Ragini (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/katrina-kaif">Katrina Kaif</a>) &ndash; who comes up with a business plan of helping the disturbed souls of the world get &lsquo;Moksha&rsquo; aka. Salvation. What are the challenges that the trio encounters on this spooky adventure? Does the plan work? The entire mystery unfolds in Phone Bhoot.</p>

<h3><strong>What works?</strong></h3>

<p>There is an attempt to treat the horror genre with an element of spoof and this unique aspect does work in the first 30 minutes of the film. But as the story proceeds, the same aspect of industry jokes and spoof elements get repetitive. The film makes an attempt to churn out situational humor riding on dialogues with references to films and series, which is not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. Both Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter deliver a fine performance and their chemistry is one of the major highlights of the film. Katrina Kaif does well and has a strong screen presence. Watch out for the meta reference to the Slice Advertisement &ndash; it&rsquo;s sure to evoke laughter. Sheeba Chaddha is funny but doesn&rsquo;t have a big enough role.</p>

<h4><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></h4>

<p>Phone Bhoot rides on a wafer-thin plot, but that&rsquo;s not the biggest issue with the film. What doesn&rsquo;t work is the fact that the film is just not funny enough as most of the gags and one-liners land flat. Of course, the film has 5 to 7 genuinely funny moments, but they aren&rsquo;t enough to hold attention for 2 hours and 17 minutes. The comedy aside, the screenplay doesn&rsquo;t have the horror or even thrilling elements, and the whole purpose of Katrina teaming up with Siddhant and Ishaan doesn&rsquo;t come full circle. Jackie Shroff&rsquo;s character is poorly written, and it&rsquo;s more of a disservice to his 40-year career in the industry. It doesn&rsquo;t take time for us to realize how hard the makers are trying to evoke laughter. It&#39;s a film that never takes itself too seriously (entering the spoof space) and that&rsquo;s where the issue lies &ndash; some drama and emotion would have brought in much-needed depth in the screenplay.</p>

<h3><strong>Performances</strong></h3>

<p>Katrina Kaif is the star attraction of Phone Bhoot, carrying the story on her shoulder and she does well as Ragini. She has a strong screen presence and it&rsquo;s difficult to not speak of her spectacular dance moves in the two songs. Siddhant Chaturvedi and Ishaan Khatter are like Ram and Shyam, Amar, and Prem, sharing extremely comfortable chemistry on screen. They got the conviction to deliver in the silliest scenario and they make an attempt to bring flavor to the on-screen madness. &nbsp;Jackie Shroff plays a version of himself in a poorly executed character. Sheeba Chaddha has a brief role, and her episode of &lsquo;Moksha&rsquo; with Katrina Kaif is funny.</p>

<p>Final Verdict</p>

<p>Phone Bhoot fails to deliver as a film &ndash; it&rsquo;s neither scary nor funny &ndash; and ends up being a forgetful affair. Some of the gags and dialogues work in isolation, but that&rsquo;s all about it. The world of spoof cinema won&rsquo;t have many takers at the box office.</p>

<p>Set in Dehradun, India, Mathukutty Xavier&rsquo;s Mili, headlined by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/janhvi-kapoor">Janhvi Kapoor</a> is a remake of the director&rsquo;s own 2019 Malayalam survival-thriller, Helen. Revolving around the titular character, Mili (Janhvi Kapoor) is hardworking, focussed and a dedicated girl, who is extremely close to her father (played by Manoj Pahwa). She dreams to move abroad, but in the meanwhile works at a fast food centre to financially support herself and her dad. However, as fate might have it, one unfortunate night she gets stuck in a freezer and struggles to save her life, while her loved ones try their best to find the missing youngster. What happens next is for you to watch in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The most strongest part about the film is its second half, because it takes you on a roller coaster of emotions, including fear, anxiety, patience, sorrow, guilt, and much more. So the majority of its high points are squeezed in the last approximately 60 minutes. What supports that plethora of emotions is the phenomenal background music created by AR Rahman. That is one of the most important elements of a survival-drama, and the Academy Award winning composer does complete justice to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DOP (Director of photography) Sunil Karthikeyan has canned some amazing shots, especially the ones filmed in the freezer, depicting the pain that the central character is going through. Furthermore, these frames are beautifully supported by Production Designer Apurwa Sondhi&rsquo;s vision, which is on point with the overall flavour of the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The first half of the film, especially the portion where Mili&#39;s life is drawn and described. Considering the genre of the project and the thrill and the mystery that it promises, the aforementioned narrative could have been trimmed down. A survival-drama needs to keep you on the edge, and Mili takes a while to help the audience reach that point. In the director&rsquo;s defence, he wants you to understand the world of Mili before he lets you on her journey of pain and triumph, so that you can relate to her struggle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fair point. However, the screenplay of that portion could have been squeezed in a more appropriate time by writer Ritesh Shah, in collaboration with director Mathukutty Xavier and editor Monisha Baldawa. The overall length of the film could have also been brought down by 10 to 15 minutes. Furthermore, while the background music is brilliant, the songs also created by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/ar-rahman">Rahman</a> fail to make an impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Janhvi Kapoor&rsquo;s growth as an actor is evident in Mili. Her performance enables you to relate with the agony of the titular character, which is a big victory for an artist. Her chemistry with Manoj Pahwa, who plays her father, shines on screen. Pahwa is effortless in his portrayal of varied emotions, and it makes one wonder if there is anything that he can&rsquo;t pull off on screen. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/sunny-kaushal">Sunny Kaushal </a>in his limited screen time gives a sincere performance, while actor Anuraag Arora makes you feel hatred towards his character SI Satish Rawat, which speaks volumes about his performance in the movie. Sanjay Suri makes a small but impactful appearance. There is a surprise cameo in the film too. Watch out for it.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Mili is a sincere attempt but doesn&rsquo;t create a strong impact. However, the performances, and especially the second half of the film makes it a decent watch.</p>

<p>Double XL is about how destiny brings two plus-sized women &ndash; Rajshree Trivedi (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/huma-qureshi">Huma Qureshi</a>) and Saira Khanna (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/sonakshi-sinha">Sonakshi Sinha</a>)&nbsp;&ndash; to rediscover life against all odds. While Rajshree aspires to be a sports commentator, Saira wishes to make a fashion documentary with the aspiration to start her own brand. The two leads are often pulled back by social factors, who prefer to focus on their weight and not their might. At the plot level, Double XL picks up a subject that had the potential to touch upon stereotypical human behavior, but their execution is as superficial as it gets.</p>

<h2><strong>What works?</strong></h2>

<p>There are three aspects in totality that work for Double XL. The thought is noble, though seldom do noble thoughts translate into fruitful returns. At the idea level, there was a lot on the table for the makers to amp up the drama, but the journey in the 2-hour-plus film is unexplored due to the convenience factor. Sonakshi Sinha&rsquo;s act touches the right notes, and she proves that the right director can extract the performance from her. Huma Qureshi is decent, though her character goes off the track when trying to touch the high pitch at multiple over-the-top moments.</p>

<h3><strong>What doesn&rsquo;t work?</strong></h3>

<p>The main issue with Double XL lies in the fact that the core conflict of the film is not exciting enough to spark interest. Yes, it&rsquo;s a story of two plus-sized women, but what does the maker intend to do with this aspect? The idea of interlinking the story with the sports commentator and fashion designer element is hollow and the medium to attain the dream is full of convenient moments. There&rsquo;s little drama, and no challenges &ndash; which makes the final achievement of the characters look easy. You don&rsquo;t feel when the characters rise, but why? Because they never fall in their journey. &nbsp;Zaheer Iqbal made a fine and confident debut with NoteBook, but he seems to be in a different zone in Double XL. The entire Kapil Dev episode is also a letdown.&nbsp; The romantic track doesn&rsquo;t connect and just pops out of nowhere. The dialogues don&#39;t work either.</p>

<h4><strong>Performances</strong></h4>

<p>As mentioned above, Sonakshi Sinha is honest and sincere as Siara Khanna. Her character has some interesting dialogues and a vague sense of redemption too. The performance deserved a better script to be noticed by the audience, as this one won&rsquo;t be seen by many. Huma Qureshi is decent as Rajshree Trivedi, though, there are some humorous episodes that needed a slightly subtle approach. The over-the-top elements in her character are not impressive. Zaheer Iqbal is a letdown on the part of the line producer, Zoravar. Mahat Raghavendra as Srikanth is funny in the first half, but the same joke around his character is stretched for far too long. Jimmy Shergill is wasted in his cameo, same can be said for Shikhar Dhawan and Kapil Dev, though both of them get a dynamic introduction.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Double XL misfires on multiple levels &ndash; It&rsquo;s neither dramatic nor entertaining &ndash; and ends up being a rather dull affair, which won&rsquo;t do well at the box office. It&#39;s a subject that needed mature treatment, with a fine blend of drama and humor and some depth in the emotions.</p>

<p>While &lsquo;Yamlok&rsquo; is known as a point of no return, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/thank-god-diwali-trailer-out-ajay-devgn-helps-sidharth-malhotra-redeem-himself-of-all-the-sins-1194774">director Indra Kumar&rsquo;s Thank God featuring Ajay Devgn, Sidharth Malhotra and Rakul Preet Singh</a> gives an interesting spin to that belief. This comedy-drama revolves around Ayaan Kapoor (played by Sidharth Malhotra), a self-centred human, a greedy business person and an even worst family man. He meets with a lethal accident and reaches the court of a modernised version of Chitragupt aka CG (played by Ajay Devgn), where he is given a chance to explain his sins, and to even redeem himself in a game of life. Now, whether he succeeds at that or not is for you to see in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>Emotional scenes. Yes, you read that right. In a comedy movie, while one would expect the satire to be its strongest element, for me what works better are the emotive sequences, especially the ones towards the end of the film. Which is also why the second half comes across far stronger than the first portion of Thank God. The initial part lacks high points, but the twist in the end of the film truly surprises and shocks the viewer. Again, dialogues like &lsquo;Bhagwan mein maante ho, par bhagwan ki ek nahin maante&rsquo;, in stirring sequences leave an impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Camera work by Director Of Photography (DOP) Aseem Bajaj helps lift a lot of dull sequences, especially the ones that were inherently conceptualised to be funny. Editing by Dharmendra Sharma is sharp, while music - especially the remakes &ldquo;Manike&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dil De Diya Hai&rdquo; - works for Thank God. Jubin Nautiyal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Haaniya Ve&rdquo; also manages to stand out. Kudos to composers Tanishk Bagchi, Rochak Kohli, Anand Raaj Anand and Chamath Sangeeth.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>What doesn&rsquo;t work for Thank God is its first half, which fails to keep you engrossed. Director Indra Kumar and writers Aakash Kaushik and Madhur Sharma could have spent some more time sharpening this portion of the movie. While the overall idea of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/thank-god-box-office-preview-ajay-devgn-sidharth-malhotra-starrer-runtime-screen-count-opening-day-1196012">Thank God</a> is fascinating, it is the execution where the film takes the major beating. The jokes are old-fashioned, while most one liners often fall flat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually in a weak narrative, the background music gets a chance to be the star and help lift dry sequences. However, Amar Mohile&rsquo;s score fails to do so. Production design by Bhavik M Dalwadi doesn&rsquo;t do much for the film, while VFX by Ny Vfxwaala could have been much better. Action choreography by RP Yadav is average.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Ajay Devgn lives up to his part of CG and justifies the role. With some more able dialogues the character could have done wonders. Sidharth Malhotra shows potential in comedy, and with the right script and lines can do a lot more in the genre. Nonetheless, he plays his part well in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/exclusive-sidharth-malhotra-opens-up-on-his-upcoming-film-thank-god-its-clash-with-ram-setu-1193743">Thank God</a>. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/rakul-preet-singh">Rakul Preet Singh</a> plays Sidharth&rsquo;s wife and cop - Ruhi. She does her best to portray a caricaturish role that needed sincere efforts from the writers. A bank scene involving her character is very poorly executed. Seema Pahwa is as usual wonderful in her limited screen time, while Kiku Sharda in just one scene proves his mettle as an actor, and especially his hold over comedy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Thank God had potential with a unique idea and sincere performances at its helm, but it is the weak writing that makes it a lacklustre affair.</p>

The subject will have some takers, but we wish, the director had gone wider with his vision by integrating opposition from the natural forces too, and not just stick to the human evils. Watch it for Akshay Kumar, Satyadev, and a rather novel though despite jitters in the screenplay and execution. It&rsquo;s a mixed bag, though better than the last 3 Akshay Kumar films &ndash; Cuttputtli, Raksha Bandhan, and Samrat Prithviraj.</p>

<p><br />
The performance of every cast member is nice and breezy, and it does seem like they are enjoying what they are working on. The screenplay gives scope to every actor to shine and have center stage, while not diverting much from what this season tries to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h3>

<p><br />
Episode 1 and Episode 2 of Season 3 may seem a notch lower than the former two seasons, but it is certainly enjoyable and watchable for fans and also neutrals.</p>

<p><strong>Director:</strong> Anubhuti Kashyap</p>

<p><strong>Release: </strong>Theatres</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Director Anubhuti Kashyap&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/with-doctor-g-arriving-at-the-theatres-check-out-some-bollywood-films-portraying-the-doctor-patient-bond-1194886">Doctor G</a> is a comedy-drama that largely revolves around Dr. Uday Gupta (played by Ayushmann Khurrana), who intends to specialise in orthopaedics, but life has other plans as he ends up in all-female gynaecology class. While this change lands him in some awkward situations, it also gives him a chance to evaluate and understand masculinity from a female gaze, thus learning some important life lessons along the way. Rakul Preet Singh&rsquo;s Dr. Fatima Siddiqui, Shefali Shah&rsquo;s Dr. Nandini Srivastav, and Sheeba Chadha&rsquo;s Lakshmi Devi Gupta knowingly or unknowingly become a part of Uday&rsquo;s introspection process.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The most beautiful part about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/doctor-g-advance-booking-ayushmann-khurrana-and-rakul-preet-singh-starrer-secures-low-advances-deets-inside-1194880">Doctor G</a> is its intent. While we have seen many movies in the past which have addressed problems around machismo and toxic masculinity, this one takes a comedic route to highlight these challenges that our society has been grappling with for many years. Topics like taking women from granted, inappropriate behaviour, jealousy from a female partner&rsquo;s success, stereotype, friendship between a man and a woman, superiority complex in a relationship, among many other issues have been poignantly highlighted in this medical campus based comedy-drama. Kudos to story writers Saurabh Bharat and Vishal Wagh for penning this idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Production design by Bindiya Chhabria and Arvind Kumar is bang on, as it stays true to the milieu and the theme in which the film is set. A run time of approx two hours is also appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Not?</strong></p>

<p>The weakest part about Doctor G is its screenplay. While the film has an interesting beginning, it doesn&#39;t remain consistent in engagement and entertainment. Considering it is a comedy-drama, one would expect enough high points throughout the narrative to keep the story engaging and funny, however that doesn&rsquo;t happen with Doctor G, which makes the whole attempt a half-baked affair. Writers Sumit Saxena, Saurabh Bharat, Vishal Wagh and Anubhuti Kashyap should have focused a lot more on this aspect of the film, besides the overall direction too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dialogues penned by Sumit Saxena fail to connect, and often fall flat in comedic situations, while Amit Trivedi&rsquo;s music and Ketan Sodha&rsquo;s background score also doesn&rsquo;t do much for the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Ayushmann Khurrana gives his all for a weakly drafted character that fails to stand out. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/rakul-preet-singh-reveals-how-her-parents-reacted-to-her-movies-doctor-g-and-chhatriwali-exclusive-1194589">Rakul Preet Singh</a> also plays her part well, but overall their pairing lacks chemistry on the big screen. Sheeba Chadha effortlessly manages to bring the innocence of her character alive, while <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/shefali-shah">Shefali Shah</a> plays Dr. Nandini to the T. Other cast members, including Shraddha and Priyam Saha lend able support to the film.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Doctor G had set out with a noble objective, but lost its path along the way. This comedy-drama forgot to prescribe the best medicine, which is laughter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Director: </strong>Pan Nalin</p>

<p><strong>Release: </strong>Theatres</p>

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>

<p>Director Pan Nalin&rsquo;s coming-of-age Gujarati drama <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/chhello-show-child-actor-rahul-koli-passes-away-at-10-1194470">Chhello Show</a> (Last Film Show) is India&#39;s official entry to Oscars. The film revolves around a young boy Samay (played by Bhavin Rabari) who discovers his love for cinema after witnessing its magic in a single screen theatre. However, his orthodox father (Bapuji, played by Dipen Raval) doesn&rsquo;t approve of the child&rsquo;s affection for movies, which forces him to pursue his ambition secretly. Just like every path that takes you closer to your dream, Samay too faces several challenges and roadblocks along the way before he understands his true calling, and acts upon it to reach his desired destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s Hot?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest strength of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/chhello-show-trailer-karan-johar-lauds-indias-oscar-entry-says-film-is-putting-us-on-global-map-1192603">Chhello Show</a> is how rooted it is in terms of visuals, approach and treatment. The placement and the depiction of the primary characters - Samay, Baa (Richa Meena), Bapuji and projectionist Fazal (Bhavesh Shrimali) - stays true to the milieu and the theme of the project. The story is also very relatable, which allows the audience to connect with the quest narrative. Dialogues penned by Keyu Shah is another strong element of the movie. They are simple, impactful and some even make you think. &ldquo;Aa Badho Khel Vaarta No Che. Bhavishya Na Badha Maaliko Vaartakaro Che (The game is to tell stories. The future belongs to storytellers),&rdquo; is one such example of rousing lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Director of Photography (DOP) Swapnil S Sonawane&rsquo;s lens brings alive the world of Chalala, the Saurashtra village in which the film is set. Especially, his wide angle shots do justice with the beauty of the location. While costume design by Sia Seth and casting by Dilip Shankar is bang on, production design by Pan Nalin himself looks authentic, considering Chhello Show is touted as semi-autobiographical. However, the portion that steals your heart is the climax, which one has to see to experience it. Samay and director Pan Nalin&rsquo;s love for cinema comes alive on the big screen with all the tributes that have been paid in the sequence.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s not?</strong></p>

<p>What doesn&rsquo;t really work for me is the pace in the second half. While the first half manages to introduce and engulf you into the world of Chhello Show, one would expect a certain speed and maybe more high points in the latter half of the film. Writer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/pan-nalin-dismisses-claims-of-chhello-show-being-a-replica-of-cinema-paradiso-1194077">Pan Nalin</a> and editors Shreyas Beltangdy and Pavan Bhat could have spent a little more time in sharpering that. Music by Cyril Morin too doesn&rsquo;t connect.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>Bhavin Rabari, who plays the lead protagonist is a wonder boy, and the real star of Last Film Show. He has truly brought Samay alive on the big screen, making him both real and relatable. His partner in crime, projectionist Fazal played by Bhavesh Shrimali has delivered an equally impactful performance. Dipen Raval as Samay&rsquo;s father portrays a beautiful arc, though my favourite character from Chhello Show is of Samay&rsquo;s mother played by Richa Meena. She has given an extremely controlled performance, beautifully portraying the dilemma of a mother that hails from a conservative set up. Other supporting cast, including the kids who play Samay&rsquo;s friends have lived up to their roles.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Chhello Show (Last Film Show) is a human story, effortlessly depicting the beauty of desire, hope and passion through Samay&rsquo;s character. Watch it for the love of cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Delightful moments don&rsquo;t always result in a delightful film. While the aforementioned sequences stand out in isolation, they don&rsquo;t come together to weave themselves into the story, which qualifies for being more of a thread/subplot than a full-length feature film. The runtime is too long for a plot centered around death, whereas the character of children is not given many contexts. If not for all, at-least Rashmika Mandanna&rsquo;s character warranted a backstory, which would have added another flavour to the story. While it&rsquo;s all going at a decent pace in the first half, things dip in the second half with an overdose of emotional moments, without much of an adequate build-up. The film lags behind on the humour front too.</p>

<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>

<p>GoodBye belongs to Amitabh Bachchan. From the first frame till the last, he is simply fantastic proving why he is indispensable as an actor. Be it the authoritative scenes, emotional ones or the light-hearted ones &ndash; Amitabh Bachchan is the heart and soul of GoodBye. It&rsquo;s his performance that makes GoodBye a watchable fare. Rashmika Mandanna is decent in her part but suffers due to a highly undercooked character. To make a debut in Hindi Film Industry, Rashmika definitely deserved a better and more filling character. Pavail Gulati does well and gets adequate support from Elli Avaram. Both Sahil Mehta and Abhishekh Khan also are apt for their brief appearance. Sunil Grover makes a brief appearance and brings in laughter in every frame he is a part of. And finally, it&rsquo;s refreshing to watch Neena Gupta enjoy herself in this film as Gayatri. Hers is probably the best-sketched character, she&rsquo;s full of life, and we wish, there were more of her scenes in the film. The backstory for both Rashmika and Neena Gupta would have added a new dimension to the script, which at present runs on a singular plot point. Late Arun Bali is heartwarming in his brief appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>GoodBye works in parts and doesn&rsquo;t in parts. While some moments alongside the soothing music stands out, the plot is wafer thin to hold attention for almost two and a half hour. In a rather uncertain world, there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough interest in people to watch a film centered around death on the big screen. If you are an Amitabh Bachchan fan, watch it for his performance. The intent is to create the magic of Baghban for today&#39;s audience, but the narrative lacks the emotional depth and simplicity of the 2003 film.</p>

The music is weak and warranted at least one chartbuster. However, the background score by Sam CS acts like another hero in all scenes. It&rsquo;s designed to justify the larger-than-life aura of Hrithik Roshan, with grandeur in all beats made for Vedha. The placement of Bande in the second half is sure to be greeted with whistles. A dialogue-heavy film like Vikram Vedha is loaded with one-liners by Manoj Muntashir and B.A. Fida, which are sure to result in multiple clap-trap moments for the audience.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, there are a lot of quirks added in the character traits of Vikram and Vedha, which is a welcome change from the original. The action sequences are well designed by Parvez Shaikh, and they look even better with Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan. One miss in the climax action block lies in the fact that it had ample scope for better build-up for Vedha. Watch out for the machine gun action scene - It is a riot.</p>

<p>There are some stars who are best experienced on the big screen and one of those is Hrithik Roshan. He gets into the skin of Vedha, and brings in an element of madness to it. When he hits someone, we know he can do it, as such is the conviction, such is the body language. He makes all the action scenes look believable. HR manages to hide the storm beneath the calm when needed and explodes like a bomb in the intense moments &ndash; it&rsquo;s a rare combo, which he strikes to perfection. Saif Ali Khan delivers another reliable performance as Vikram, emerging as the perfect nemesis to Hrithik. He gets his moments of those walks and displays bravado at the right moments. Watch out for the metamorphizes of his character through the narrative, and the small tweaks in his body language. Radhika Apte as Priya and Rohit Saraf as Krishna do well in their respective roles, but the real surprise package of Vikram Vedha is Sharib Hashmi. He is simply phenomenal as Babloo, and stands tall in front of both, Hrithik and Saif. The rest of the cast is decent.</p>

<p>Overall, Vikram Vedha is an action thriller designed to be best experienced on the big screen to celebrate the presence of Hrithik Roshan and Saif Ali Khan. It&rsquo;s loaded with action, dialogue-baazi, and the right amount of massy elements, but warranted a little better music. The lack of a romantic track for either of the two leads (as demanded by the script) makes the reach a little concentrated, but nonetheless, it has enough to emerge as a winner for the audience in terms of a package for big-screen entertainment.</p>

<strong>Cast</strong>: Amit Sial, Monika Panwar, Dibyendu Bhattacharya, Sparsh Srivastava</p>

<p><br />

<p><br />
<strong>Streaming on</strong>: Netflix</p>

<p><br />
One of the most frequent genres presented on digital platforms these days is a crime-drama. It is also one of the most popular content categories across the world, and with a watertight plot and the right amount of suspense and thrill, a certain show is most likely to create a dedicated fan following of its own. Director Soumendra Padhi&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusive-jamtara-2-s-shoot-resume-third-week-july-be-shot-lucknow-read-deets-805302">Jamtara: Season 2</a> falls in the same category. After impressing a major section of the audience with season 1, the franchise is back with bigger scams and a larger story in part 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Just like season one, which revolved around the phishing racket in the Jamtara district, the second instalment of the franchise is about that, and a lot more. From the first scene itself, Jamtara: Season 2 engulfs you into the world of crime, fear and arrogance of the culprits involved. This atmosphere allows the viewer to connect season one with the second season, before introducing newer challengers for the group, which forces them to think of more unique ways to con a much aware crowd now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Jamtara: Season 2&rsquo;s story has evolved with time, and has incorporated many other real life incidents to add more reliability to the show. Kudos to writer Trishant Srivastava for striking that right balance between the old and the new in the first episode. Production designer Susheel Mishra manages to maintain consistency in the look and the feel of the show, while DOP (Director of Photography) Sayak Bhattacharya&rsquo;s lens effortlessly brings the world of Jamtara to life. Editing by Micky Sharma is sharp, with some transitional scenes beautifully presented.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
As for the performances, actors Amit Sial (Brajesh Bhaan), <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/mirzapur-actor-dibyendu-bhattacharya-recalls-working-after-mother-s-demise-i-spent-entire-day-crying-752823">Dibyendu Bhattacharya</a> (Inspector Biswa Paathak), Sparsh Shrivastav (Sunny) and Monika Panwar (Gudiya) continue to impress in Jamtara: Season 2. Going by the first episode, part 2 of this crime based show seems promising, and remains as entertaining as part one of the Jamtara franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Dulquer Salmaan, Sunny Deol, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Pooja Bhatt</p>

<p><strong>Release:</strong> Theatres&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/chup-dulquer-salmaan-and-pooja-bhatt-exude-joy-as-they-promote-upcoming-thriller-in-the-city-pics-1189863">Chup: Revenge of the Artist</a> Review</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to presenting unique concepts on the big screen, R Balki takes the cake, baker and the bakery. After helming some distinctive movies in the past like Cheeni Kum and Paa, the filmmaker&rsquo;s next - Chup is once again an out of the box story. Featuring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/chup-box-office-preview-sunny-deol-and-dulquer-salmaan-starrer-runtime-screen-count-opening-day-1191415">Dulquer Salmaan, Sunny Deol, Shreya Dhanwanthary and Pooja Bhatt</a> in pivotal roles, Chup: Revenge of the Artist is an amalgamation of reel and real world elements. A thriller with a twist, it begins with a gruesome murder of a film critic that immediately attracts media attention to the incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sunny Deol, who plays cop Arvind Mathur, takes on the case, and even while he attempts to solve the mystery of the first slaughter, two more killings follow the incident leaving the system baffled for answers. Along the way, Danny (Dulquer Salaam) and Nila&rsquo;s (Shreya Dhanwanthary) lives get entangled with the event, thus inviting some expected and unexpected twists in the story. Like I mentioned right in the beginning, kudos to Balki for furnishing an absolutely eccentric idea around film critics and movie criticism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, my grouse is with the genre he chose to present the point of view. The biggest challenge for a murder mystery is to weave a watertight plot, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/dulquer-salmaan-mixes-formal-and-ethnic-look-with-jodhpuri-jacket-at-chup-promotions-photos-1191017">Chup: Revenge of the Artist</a> is not up to the mark in that aspect. There are a few occasions in the movie when you sense a convenient lack of logic and some explanations too, because it seems there was a larger purpose that writer-director Balki along with his co-writers Raja Sen &amp; Rishi Virmani wanted to achieve. While Balki&rsquo;s love for cinema evidently comes across in the story, what it lacks is a better screenplay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the first half does manage to keep you hooked, it is the second half that is dragged and lacks high points. Dialogues also penned by Balki, Sen and Virmani, work beautifully in a few scenes especially in the context of cinema, but fall flat in the sequences involving suspense and thrill. However, my most favourite part about Chup is its background score, and the overall music of the film. It&rsquo;s managed to achieve the right mix of old world charm with contemporary, and the use of &ldquo;Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam&rdquo; from Guru Dutt&rsquo;s Kaagaz Ke Phool is simply magical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those words can metaphorically mean anything in different contexts, and it perfectly does so in Chup: Revenge of the Artist. Kudos to Balki for giving the rightful credit to lyricist Kaifi Azmi and music director SD Burman for using &ldquo;Waqt Ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam&rdquo; in Chup, while also acknowledging the efforts of his film&rsquo;s crew - composers Amit Trivedi, Sneha Khanwalkar, Aman Pant and lyricist Swanand Kirkire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visually too the film is stunning, all thanks to DOP Vishal Sinha and production designer Sandeep Sharad Ravade. Especially those aware of Bandra&rsquo;s age-old connection with the film industry and cinema in general would love the portrayal of Mumbai&rsquo;s coastal suburb in the film. While editing by Nayan HK Bhadra could have been a little more sharper in the second half, casting by Shruti Mahajan is bang on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the performances, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/dulquer-salmaan">Dulquer Salmaan</a> is the star of the film. He delivers a fine, layered and nuanced performance, probably the best that I have seen in this year. Shreya Dhanwanthary plays an entertainment reporter in Chup, and while she has played a journalist earlier too in Scam 1992, she does complete justice with her part here as well. A must mention for an apt portrayal of the newsroom, and life of a newsperson in general too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pooja Bhatt gives a controlled performance, while <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/sunny-deol">Sunny Deol</a> gives his best to his cop outing in R Balki&rsquo;s directorial. Though I do feel that his character needed a little more stronger foundation. Saranya Ponvannan was outstanding in her limited screen time.</p>

<p>There is always a scope of improvement in every field, and Chup: Revenge of the Artist does present a very fresh perspective to film criticism. There is some learning for everyone to take back home. While a lot of debate around movie reviews has been going on for a while, nobody has ever presented it for the audience with this perspective, and with Guru Dutt&rsquo;s Kaagaz Ke Phool at the core. But it is also important to note and remember, that film viewing in general is a very subjective experience, and every film lover should be entitled to that opinion, obviously presented in a respectful way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, R Balki&rsquo;s Chup: Revenge of the Artist is a unique film, but is not critic proof. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Release: </strong>Theatres&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jahaan Chaar Yaar Review</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s disappointing when a project has great intent but fails to translate that on screen. Director and writer Kamal Pandey&rsquo;s Jahaan Chaar Yaar is exactly that film. Dealing with their own marital challenges back home, childhood friends Shivangi (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/sonam-kapoor-is-going-to-be-a-fun-mom-says-swara-bhasker-shell-have-many-stories-to-tell-about-the-baby-1190351">Swara Bhasker</a>), Mansi (Meher Vij), Sakina (Pooja Chopra) and Neha (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/shikha-talsania">Shikha Talsania</a>) take off on an unplanned, unexpected trip to Goa with an objective to unwind. Little did they know, they had an adventure waiting for them in the coastal state, which turned their lives upside down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jahaan Chaar Yaar makes a sincere attempt to highlight the struggles of a homemaker, and make a statement on emotional and physical infidelity, self-doubt, lack of respect, abuse, and a lot more. However, it ends up being a confused tale of morality muddled in its own over dramatic plot and unbalanced characters. While the first half still has some engaging moments, the second half is filled with expected twists, poorly drafted one liners, and unnecessary theatrics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Writer Kamal Pandey could have spent a little more time in sharpening the loose screenplay, which is one the biggest drawbacks of this Vinod Bachchan production. None of the dialogues really stand out too, though some have been delivered in a way that makes it sound funny. But none of it really connects or makes you feel the emotion, which in a subject like this should. Cinematography by Sethu Sriram is also ordinary. Most of the Goa scenes are only limited to the beach and the resort, elements that have been over explored in many movies in the past, thus limiting the visual appeal of the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, while Amar Mohile&rsquo;s background score does justice in the comedy scenes, it fails to engage in the sequences of mystery and suspense. Music by Anand Raj Anand, Rashid Khan and Sanjeev Chaturvedi also doesn&rsquo;t do much to lift the spirits of the viewers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the performances, all the four actresses - <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/swara-bhasker-says-she-tired-palying-dabang-characters-actor-you-want-do-new-things-1180734">Swara Bhasker</a>, Shikha Talsania, Meher Vij and Pooja Chopra do a decent job with their respective characters. However, their parts inherently lacked depth, which the writer needed to fix before the film went on the floors. Girish Kulkarni&rsquo;s cop outing also depends a lot on the character&rsquo;s quirks, which makes the part even more superficial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, Jahaan Chaar Yaar had potential, but ultimately lacks entertainment and fails to connect.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Brahmastra: Part One &ndash; Shiva Review</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/brahmastra-ranbir-kapoors-shiva-was-first-named-rumi-heres-a-rare-pic-from-actors-initial-look-test-1189233">Brahmastra: Part One &ndash; Shiva</a> is a classic example of ambition meeting vision. Both of them are practically hollow without each other, and thankfully this Ayan Mukerji directorial manages to bring alive this combination of aspiration and imagination on the big screen. Film watching overall is a subjective experience, with most of the time the audience preferring one element of the movie over the other. However, this Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt starrer should be seen for the overall impact it creates on the viewer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set in modern times, it largely narrates the story of the most powerful weapon Brahmastra, with a love story that is intertwined in a battle of good and bad, right and wrong, and most importantly desire and responsibility. Shiva (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/ranbir-kapoor-says-he-cant-take-brahmastras-advance-bookings-seriously-calls-alia-bhatt-trade-analyst-1189253">Ranbir Kapoor</a>), a DJ, is aware of his powers but chooses to bury them deep within himself. The lonely orphan finds love in Isha (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/alia-bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>) and intends to live a regular life. However, despite his unwillingness, destiny takes him on an adventure of power and passion, and of acceptance and realisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I loved the most about Brahmastra: Part One &ndash; Shiva is its engrossing screenplay. Right from the word go, the narrative demands attention with regular high points appropriately arranged throughout the 166 minutes run time. Watch out for the pre and post interval scenes. There are some sharp dips here and there especially in the romantic sequences, but it quickly picks up pace bringing the focus back on the story of Brahmastra. Now, that&rsquo;s a hard thing to do especially after songs and softer sequences in a fantasy project. The credit here is as much for Ayan Mukerji, as it is for editor Prakash Kurup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, dialogues penned by Hussain Dalal were letting down a few sequences that needed able support from a few strong lines. The language could have been far less casual at certain points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like a lot of things that work in combinations for Brahmastra, like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/pic-karan-johar-expresses-excitement-as-alia-bhatt-and-ranbir-kapoors-brahmastra-releases-says-its-here-1189260">Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt</a> or intention and innovation, action and visual effects too is one of the most solid amalgamations of this fantasy adventure movie. Both merged together present an engaging visual in the cinema, bringing every concept art created for the film to life. All credit for it should go to action and stunt designers Dan Bradley, Diyan Hristov and Parveez Sheikh, and the VFX partners DNEG and ReDefine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cinematographers Sudeep Chatterjee, Patrick Duroux, Pankaj Kumar, V. Manikandan and Vikash Nowlakha manage to effortlessly showcase the world of Brahmastra through their lens. However, there was definitely scope for more experimentation and innovation for production designer Amrita Mahal Nakai. Music by Pritam stands out, while choreographers Ganesh Acharya, Brinda and Adil Shaikh do a decent job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the performances, both Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt live up to the characters of Shiva and Isha. Amitabh Bachchan plays Guru and there is probably nothing that he can&rsquo;t play on screen. Nagarjuna Akkineni personifies the Nandi Astra with his character Anish Shetty, while <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/mouni-roy">Mouni Roy</a> is the surprise element of the film. Brahmastra: Part One &ndash; Shiva in its own way pays a tribute to her popular TV character. Cameos by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/topic/shah-rukh-khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Deepika Padukone and Dimple Kapadia elevate the experience, though I wish a little more background was known about SRK and Kapadia&rsquo;s characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other supporting cast, including Saurav Gurjar, Gurfateh Pirzada, Lehar Khan, Aditi Joshi, Markand Soni, Stanzin Delek and Rouhallah Gazi play their parts to the T.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, Brahmastra: Part One &ndash; Shiva is an immersive experience that promises entertainment. Watch it for the experience and the love of cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<div><strong>Delhi Crime: Season 2 Review</strong></div>

<div>Cinema is a reflection of our society, and I love projects that are able to showcase those realities in their content. Director Tanuj Chopra&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/delhi-crime-s2-trailer-shefali-shah-aka-dcp-vartika-chaturvedi-tries-decode-series-murders-watch-1173291">Delhi Crime: Season 2</a> is one such show. While topics like caste divide, exploitation of the minorities, rampant corruption and unfortunate media trials are the basis of the narrative in season 2, this Shefali Shah fronted show subtly also comments on greed, ambition, patriarchy, sexism, challenges of the police force, and on the refreshing perspectives of the youth. They are also neatly arranged in the story for the audience to grasp on.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Delhi Crime 2 features <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/shefali-shah-difference-between-delhi-crime-s1-s2-investment-characters-has-become-even-more-1179004">Shefali Shah</a>, Rajesh Tailang, Rasika Dugal, Tillotama Shome, Adil Hussain, Sidharth Bhardwaj, Gopal Datt, Anurag Arora, and Denzil Smith. It revolves around DCP Vartika Chaturvedi (played by Shefali Shah) and her team&rsquo;s efforts to solve the mystery around the heinous crimes that&rsquo;s happening with the privileged senior citizens of the city. While one would expect crime dramas to maintain a certain pace in the narrative for an edge of the seat experience, this one takes a while to speed up.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I suppose that is because the intention of the makers was not really to solve the crime quickly, but to use the story to share important messages and point of views along the way. Though Delhi Crime: Season 2 does pick up pace after the second episode, and keeps you hooked to the screen till the end. While season one was more about the case, maybe because of the emotions and the information attached to it, the second season makes way for getting to know the primary characters even more closely with their personal struggles, vulnerability and interpersonal relationships.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Kudos to writers Mayank Tewari, Shubhra Swarup, Vidit Tripathi and Ensia Mirza for achieving so many standpoints in this five episode series. However, what I loved the most about Delhi Crime 2 are its dialogues penned by Sanyuktha Chawla Shaikh and Virat Basoya. Lines like, &ldquo;Afterall we can&#39;t police the lifestyle of the wealthy, nor the aspiration of the less privileged&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tum agar uthe nahin, toh jurm badhta jayega. Jurm karne wala seena zor banta jayega&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Courage comes at a price&rdquo; not only makes you get up and take notice, but also think and question.&nbsp;</div>

<div>DOP David Bolen&rsquo;s lens manages to capture every emotion to the T, and that combining with Shefali Shah&rsquo;s acting prowess particularly makes her close-up shots a visual treat. Ceiri Torjussen&rsquo;s music is effective. Production design by Aakash Gautam stays true to the milieu, and Mukesh Chhabra&rsquo;s casting is on point.&nbsp;</div>

<div>As for the performances in Delhi Crime 2, Shefali Shah gives a very controlled performance as DCP Vartika Chaturvedi, and has effortlessly portrayed the character&rsquo;s vulnerability onscreen. Rasika Dugal has a very layered character, and her performance leaves an impact. Adil Hussain&rsquo;s pauses have expressions too, while Tillotama Shome is the surprise element of the show. There is probably nothing that she can&rsquo;t portray on screen. Rest of the cast has lent an able support to the story.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Delhi Crime: Season 2 could have added a few more high points, especially in the initial phase of the season. However, overall it does impact and impress.&nbsp;</div>

<div><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/laal-singh-chaddha-first-reviews-aamir-khan-kareena-kapoor-starrer-being-called-faithful-forrest-gump-1174596"><strong>Laal Singh Chaddha Review</strong></a></div>

<div>One of the most difficult things about an adaptation is its comparison with the original. What is even more tough is convincing the loyal fans of an already celebrated film to see another version of it, and only Aamir Khan could have taken up a mighty task like that. His new release Laal Singh Chaddha is the official Hindi adaptation of Robert Zemeckis&rsquo; Tom Hanks starrer 1994 comedy-drama, Forrest Gump, which has bagged numerous accolades including six academy awards. It was made in a completely different era, focussing on a separate diaspora, and a distinct milieu.&nbsp;</div>

<div>However, in terms of the social environment, director Advait Chandan and writer Atul Kulkarni have been successfully able to adapt the narrative in a way that will appeal to the Indian audience. Laal Singh Chaddha is primarily a human story and how different can our conditions, situations and reactions be irrespective of the setting. So in a way, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/aamir-khan-talks-about-similarities-between-laal-singh-chadhha-and-him-we-are-honest-and-close-our-mothers">Aamir Khan</a>, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Naga Chaitanya starrer is same, same, but different. For instance, the protagonist&rsquo;s mother (played by Mona Singh) attempts to get her child admitted in a school.&nbsp;</div>

<div>This situation in the Hindi film has been very differently treated as compared to the original, showcasing the filmmaker&rsquo;s understanding of our instincts and emotions. They have got that right throughout the film. Though what doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me is how, many scenes especially in the first half have been shot just like the original. Maybe, Advait and cinematographer Satyajit Pande could have executed those scenes differently to help the audience forget the 1994 film, and relish the new version. Nonetheless, the visuals are still stunning.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Much like Forrest Gump, Laal Singh Chaddha&rsquo;s personal journey also goes through several socio and political situations including the emergency, riots, bomb blasts, political rallies, massive paegent wins, blockbusters, chartbusters, and even bold photoshoots, but at heart it remains his own voyage of acceptance, self discovery, and destiny that every common man will be able to relate with. The first half of this Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and Naga Chaitanya film is crisp with periodical high points and lots of humour, but it is the second half that seems long and needed some sharpening by editor Hemanti Sarkar.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Laal Singh Chaddha stays true to the setting of every phase it showcases in the film, and all credit for it goes to production designers Imran Manzoor and Mustafa Stationwala, and art directors Bilal Hashmi and Pravin S Kadam. In a film that spans several decades, costumes play an important part in the narrative and designer Maxima Basu does a fair job at that. As far as the music goes, Tanuj Tiku&rsquo;s background score helps to elevate the scenes, but Pritam&rsquo;s compositions don&#39;t do much for the project. Lyrics penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya help understand the situations better.&nbsp;</div>

<div>As far as the dialogues are concerned, some of them are beautifully written. Like &lsquo;Zindagi gol gappe jaisi hondi hai Laal, pet bhar janda hai par man nahin.&rdquo; Though the line is a direct reminder of the chocolate reference in the original. These reminders kept coming back when carrots and peas became aloo and gobhi, and local idiot became khota.&nbsp;</div>

<div>As far as the performances are concerned, Aamir Khan aces as Laal Singh Chaddha. He really lives the part, and that evidently comes across in the movie. Though a certain unintentional habit of his character becomes too repetitive after a while. Kareena Kapoor Khan as Rupa is phenomenal. Probably it&rsquo;s only her and Manav Vij&rsquo;s character Mohammad that has several layers of emotions, which both of them have portrayed effortlessly. Naga Chaitanya who plays Bala is outstanding in the funny scenes. Mona Singh as Aamir Khan&rsquo;s on screen mother is the heart and soul of this Advait Chandan directorial. Shah Rukh Khan&rsquo;s cameo is the most endearing part of the film, probably the biggest highlight too.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Sometimes what we seek is right there, we just need to look harder and stop complicating things. That&rsquo;s one of the most important messages that Laal Singh Chaddha conveys, among several other statements that it makes through its narrative.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Considering the stature of the original, it&rsquo;s hard to not compare <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/alia-bhatt-reviews-aamir-khan-kareena-kapoor-khans-laal-singh-chaddha-says-you-dont-want-miss-it-1174981">Laal Singh Chaddha</a> with Tom Hanks&rsquo; Forrest Gump. But even after that, Aamir Khan and his team manage to live up to the original and present an entertaining watch. Those who will be seeing it as a standalone film will be pleasantly surprised. The Hindi version is not flawless, but isn&rsquo;t perfection overrated anyway? Maybe, Aamir would agree to that this time&hellip;&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Darlings Review</strong></div>

<div>It&rsquo;s difficult to make a film that is entertaining but also has a strong message to convey, and despite several attempts in the past, very few filmmakers have been able to achieve this skill. More often than not these movies end up being preachy, or compromise on the entertainment quotient. However, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/alia-bhatt-reveals-gauri-khan-s-reaction-darlings-even-srk-agreed-if-she-likes-something-it-s-big-win-1168071" style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Darlings</a> writer-director Jasmeet K Reen effortlessly manages to execute the mighty task. Despite showing a large part of the Darlings world in the trailer itself, the dark-comedy has still a lot to offer in its little over two hour run time. Though at no point does the film seem lengthy, major credit for it goes to editor Nitin Baid.</div>

<div><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/alia-bhatt-being-creative-producer-darlings-numbers-don-t-make-any-sense-me-1168110">Darlings</a> revolve around Badrunissa Sheikh aka Badru (Alia Bhatt), a strong-willed girl who tries her best to save her failing or a rather failed marriage with hubby Hamza Sheikh (Vijay Varma). However, an unfortunate incident makes this comedy-drama a bit darker, forcing Badru and her mother Shamshunissa Sheikh (Shefali Shah) to take things in their own hands. This Jasmeet K Reen directorial is a strong statement on domestic violence. It may attract a plethora of opinions on the route that the filmmaker has chosen to make her point, but hopefully it will atleast get people discussing the subject a lot more.&nbsp;</div>

<div>That&rsquo;s not all that the film has to offer. It also makes you ponder upon topics like alcoholism and its impact on the family, superstition, manipulations, jealousy, karma, and impact of the parents&rsquo; lives and their choices on their kids. All these aspects have been beautifully weaved in a story, but almost all presented in an entertaining manner. Characters have been sketched out well with the right amount of contrast, grey shades, and innocence, which makes them both real and relatable. Kudos to writers Parveez Sheikh and Jasmeet K Reen for churning out a wholesome script.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Furthermore, dialogues penned by Vijay Maurya, Jasmeet K Reen and Parveez Sheikh stand out. Lines like, &lsquo;Saab Twitter walon ke liye duniya badal gayi hai, humare liye nahin&rsquo;, or the conversation between Inspector Rajaram Tawde (Vijay Maurya) and Shamshunissa Sheikh in the police station works more like a reality check. Cinematographer Anil Mehta&rsquo;s lens effortlessly brings the world of Darlings alive, while set designing by Garima Mathur stays true to the story. Music by Vishal Bhardwaj and Mellow D has a perfect mix of contemporary and a bit of an old world charm, but most importantly it helps to take the narrative forward.&nbsp;</div>

<div>As far as the performances are concerned, there is probably nothing that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/katrina-kaif-has-nick-name-alia-bhatt-she-praises-darlings-teaser-find-out-1156410">Alia Bhatt</a> can&rsquo;t play onscreen, and she has proved that time and again with her screen outings. The audience will get to see two very different personalities of her character in the first and the second half of the film, both exceptionally performed by Alia. Vijay Varma has played his part so well, that after a point one forgets the actor and only looks at the character. Roshan Mathew as Zulfi is the true surprise element of the film, however, for me the real star of Darlings is Shefali Shah.&nbsp;</div>

<div>At one moment the character makes a strong statement, the next second she can make you cry, and in the third can bring a big smile to your face. Truly a great performance. Rajesh Sharma as Kasim Kasai has no dialogues but still manages to make his presence felt.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Overall, Darlings stays consistent even in the second half, and a few high points scattered periodically in the script keeps you hooked to the narrative. Watch it for the message and the performances.&nbsp;</div>

However, John Abraham could have done much more with his layered character. JD Chakravarthy&rsquo;s role has an interesting growth, but Shaad Randhawa&rsquo;s character as a cop seemed confused and remained like that consistently throughout. Ek Villain Returns has an exciting cameo, which for me was the only highlight of the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the face of it, Ek Villain Returns was a promising entertainer, but it is the overall story that proves to be a bummer. The film deserves a star-and-a-half, but I would add another half to it for Arjun&rsquo;s performance.</p>

However, a few styles often metamorphose in advanced forms, especially with new technology, and the film industry is currently experiencing the same transformation. The 70s and the 80s were popularly dominated with larger-than-life-hero movies, and the trend has come back with better tech support, and is celebrated lately once again. SS Rajamouli’s RRR and Prashanth Neel’s KGF being a testimony to that. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/videos/interviews/ranbir-kapoor-team-shamshera-their-first-cinema-experience-i-have-seen-khalnayak-50-times-1165499">Shamshera headlined by Ranbir Kapoor, Vaani Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt falls in the same category</a>. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Many films in the past have been made on the premise of caste discrimination, and Karan Malhotra’s directorial largely revolves around the same subject. Shamshera (played by Ranbir Kapoor) is the leader of his community seeking freedom and respect for his people, who are considered to be from the lower caste. Their Chief takes on dacoity to make his point, but pays a heavy price in return to keep his tribe alive. What follows is a tale of vengeance, for the sake of self-esteem and right to liberty. Yes, it’s not a unique plot, but is presented in a new way, with heavy dialogues, theatrics, and able VFX support. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/ranbir-kapoor-vaani-kapoor-arrive-theatre-mumbai-celebrate-shamshera-s-release-fans-photos-1165492">Shamshera</a> is laden with lines like ‘Aakhir dharm se bada mukhota kya ho sakta hai’, which one would expect from a film like this. But it has its own situational moments of humour too, and a few quirky rhyming lines, which are mouthed by Saurabh Shukla’s character, who is the lead protagonist’s trusted ally in the battle. Large credit for those words should go to dialogue writer Piyush Mishra. The film starts at a great pace, and maintains the stride in the first half, however the narrative takes a dip in the second half impacting the length of the period-drama. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Writers Neelesh Misra and Khila Bisht, and screenplay writers Ekta Pathak Malhotra and Karan Malhotra could have huddled a little more to work on this aspect of Shamshera. However, overall the film manages to keep you hooked. Some of the action scenes choreographed by Franz Spilhaus and Parvez Shaikh stand out, but the ones in the first half could have been imagined more creatively. DOP Anay Goswamy’s wide shots are especially a vision for the sore eyes showcasing the stunning landscape, and the world of Shamshera. Background music by Mithoon helps to elevate the scenes, but the composer’s songs in the film are easily forgettable. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">As for the performances, Ranbir Kapoor is effortless as Shamshera and Balli. Despite his co-stars’ strong performances and author backed roles, he manages to hold his ground throughout the film. Vaani Kapoor shines in every scene that she appears in, while Sanjay Dutt aces as antagonist Daroga Shuddh Singh. The dichotomy in his name vis-a-vis his actions is an interesting addition to the character, and so is his sense of humour that adds to the overall theatrics of the role. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">His actions often make you wonder if there is more to his power hungry character, and maybe a spin off on Daroga Shuddh Singh in the future would be a good idea to explore that aspect of the part. Other supporting cast including, Saurabh Shukla and Ronit Roy play their parts to the T. However, Ronit’s character could have been experimented with a little more, as it gets completely stagnant after a point in the film. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Overall, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/8-revelations-ranbir-kapoor-made-about-his-relationship-alia-bhatt-during-shamshera-promotions-1164599">Karan Malhotra’s Shamshera starring Ranbir Kapoor, Vaani Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt</a> is in line with the ongoing trend of workable films, and has the right amount of drama, action, romance, humour and all other masala potboiler elements to entertain the audience. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/shamshera-review-ranbir-kapoor-vaani-kapoor-sanjay-dutt-s-film-has-all-elements-masala-potboiler-1165596</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1165596</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 09:02:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dr. Arora Ep 1, 2 Review: Imtiaz Ali and Kumud Mishra’s show is brave &amp; earnest but falls short of execution]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/dr-arora-review-main.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Dr. Arora is streaming on an OTT platform from the 22nd of July. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/dr-arora-ep-1-2-review-imtiaz-ali-and-kumud-mishra-s-show-brave-earnest-falls-short-execution-1165504</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1165504</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 06:03:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jaadugar Review: Jitendra Kumar and Jaaved Jaaferi’s film has good intent but fails to keep you hooked]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/jaadugar_review_jitendra_kumar_and_jaaved_jaaferis_film_has_good_intent_but_fails_to_keep_you_hooked_0.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Name:</strong> Jaadugar </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Director:</strong> Sameer Saxena</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Cast:</strong> Jitendra Kumar, Arushi Sharma, Jaaved Jaaferi, Manoj Joshi</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Release:</strong> Netflix</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Rating:</strong> 1.5 / 5</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">There are some films that have a good intent at the outset, but to achieve that they often get lost along the way. Director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/jaadugar-jitendra-kumar-all-set-cast-his-magic-spell-netflix-indias-quirky-new-drama-watch-1137924">Sameer Saxena’s Jaadugar</a> is a testimony of the aforementioned statement. Starring Jitendra Kumar, Arushi Sharma, Jaaved Jaaferi, and Manoj Joshi, this Biswapati Sarkar written film revolves around a magician, who for the sake of love does something that he totally hates. However, as one would expect it is this loathe, that helps him achieve his desired goal, pun intended. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">What I loved the most about this sports dramedy, is how it introduces the main premise and the central characters of the film. At this point it truly manages to hold your attention, but it is the overall pace mixed with several intertwining plotlines, that makes this Jitendra Kumar headlined movie a yawnfest. Another interesting part about Jaadugar is the usage of game cards to describe characters and situations, which most definitely is not unique but are well executed portions. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Though what I struggle to understand is the overdose of many cheesy dialogues. I wonder if they were intentional to give a certain amount of innocence or a childlike personality to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jaadugar-trailer-jitendra-kumar-magician-lover-boy-footballer-here-steal-your-raaton-ki-neend-1147426">Jitendra‘s character Meenu</a>, or was it the lack of enough effort from the writing team. Dialogues like ‘Main Meenu, raaton ki neendein chinun’ and ‘Kabhi sapnon ya sadkon pe milta hun’ were very puerile. Some of the lines seem extremely forced, and fail to create its desired impact on the emotions. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Not to forget, this 2 hour 47 minutes film stretches way too far with unnecessary scenes, and could have been brought down in terms of it’s run time on the edit table by the film’s editor Dev Rao Jadhav. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">As far as the performances are concerned, everyone tried their best to add conviction in this half baked script. Jitendra Kumar is able to make his character believable, Arushi Sharma does a decent job as Dr Disha, and there is probably nothing that Manoj Joshi can’t play onscreen. However, the star of the film for me is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/pinkvilla-style-icons-awards-jaaved-jaaferi-raps-his-iconic-song-mumbhai-ranveer-singh-watch-1148908">Jaaved Jaaferi</a>, who aces his part. Rest of the cast also give able support to the movie. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Overall, Jaadugar has its heart in the right place. However, the message it tries to convey gets lost while juggling multiple ideas of love, football, passion, women empowerment, family, and more, which make this Sameer Saxena directorial less entertaining and more exhausting. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/jaadugar-review-jitendra-kumar-and-jaaved-jaaferi-s-film-has-good-intent-fails-keep-you-hooked-1162331</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1162331</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 15:38:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shabaash Mithu Movie Review: Taapsee Pannu captains the Mithali Raj Biopic to victory despite hiccups ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/shabaash-mithu-movie-review-main_0.jpg"></img><p>The cinematography is very good, and so is the camera work in capturing the cricket matches. The dialogues are good - especially the entire monologue post Vijay Raaz's death. However, the batting shots could have been slightly better on the technical front. The best moments in the films start with the entire childhood sequence of Mithali and her friend, Noorie, followed by the intermission block, the entire sequence where Mithali becomes the youngest Indian captain, the confrontation between the Women's Team and CAI,  the motivational speech by the protagonist - Taapsee - right before the world cup and the final sequence of the women's team returning to India. The editing could have been crispier. The music by Amit Trivedi is soulful, and the track "Hindustan Meri Jaan" stands out.</p><p>Talking of performances, Shabaash Mithu is a Taapsee Pannu show. She is Mithali Raj from the first frame and performs with perfection. Taapsee is subdued in some of the key portions of the film, underplaying on the emotional front too. Watch out for her motivational speech in the second half - it's fantastic. She shines in the emotional and intense moments, though the cricketing aspect could have been slightly better. Vijay Raaz as Coach Sampath, is in his elements, delivering what can be termed a dependable performance. The two child artists - Inayat Verma, Kasturi Jagnam - are delightful in their respective parts. The rest of the ensemble do well.</p><p>All in all, Shabaash Mithu deserves to be watched to witness the journey of a woman, who is responsible for the incredible rise of Indian Women's cricket in the last two decades - Mithali Raj. Srijit Mukherji marries cricket with drama and emotions, though there are instances where he does fall in the troops of making a sport film, that bring in the deja-vu factor. Slight trimming would have made the film even more impactful. But nonetheless, by the end of it, the film makes you say, "Kya Baat Mithu". Worth A Watch. </p>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/shabaash-mithu-movie-review-taapsee-pannu-captains-mithali-raj-biopic-victory-despite-hiccups-1161858</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1161858</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jul 2022 20:10:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Khuda Haafiz 2– Agni Pariksha Review: Vidyut Jammwal, Shivaleeka Oberoi's film has purpose but lacks direction]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/khuda_haafiz_2-_agni_pariksha_review_0.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Name:</strong> Khuda Haafiz 2 – Agni Pariksha</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Director:</strong> Faruk Kabir</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Cast:</strong> Vidyut Jammwal, Shivaleeka Oberoi, Sheeba Chaddha</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Release:</strong> Theatres </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Rating:</strong> 1.5 / 5</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/revealed-details-vidyut-jammwals-character-khuda-hafiz-chapter-2-893760">Vidyut Jammwal and Shivaleeka Oberoi starrer Khuda Haafiz</a> had released in 2020, and the Faruk Kabir directed sequel of the action-thriller - Khuda Haafiz: Chapter II – Agni Pariksha, is unveiled in the cinemas today. After battling the flesh traders in part one, Sameer Chaudhary (Vidyut) and Nargis Chaudhary (Shivaleeka) come back to India with an intention to start afresh. However, they soon face another massive challenge as their adopted daughter Nandini is kidnapped by a bratty group of boys from her school. What follows next is a series of gory events, struggle and vengeance. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">While the intention of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/dibyendu-bhattacharya-begins-shooting-khuda-hafiz-chapter-2-role-different-my-other-roles-886389">Khuda Haafiz: Chapter II – Agni Pariksha</a> is noble, what it truly lacks is a direction. The movie constantly treaded on the thin line between the good and the bad, often confused on which path it wanted to march forward eventually. What disorients this already muddled plot further is Shivaleeka’s confused character. Her behaviour towards Sameer is surprising, moreso harsh, and one never truly understands the reason behind it. While it does motivate Sameer in the movie, but in a more realistic space it seemed far-fetched, a plot point that needed to be worked upon. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Writer-Director Faruk Kabir could have spent a little more time there. Khuda Haafiz: Chapter II – Agni Pariksha elevates the dichotomy of facing disappointments from quarters that one expects help from, and finding aid from a space that people usually don't anticipate from. While that isn’t a unique twist, it also gives the makers room to play up on stereotypes such as the corrupt system, and badly behaved kids from rich families. Though, what comes across as a breath of fresh air, is that the media for a change is portrayed responsibly. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Cinematography by Jitan Harmeet Singh is top class, however many shots in the climax sequence seemed like a promotion for Egypt tourism. Background music by Amar Mohile helps to advance the scenes, while action choreographed by Yannick Ben, Amin Khatib, Vidyut Jammwal, and Faruk Kabir is the best part about this film. Vidyut shines in each and every action sequence in the film. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">As far as the performances are concerned, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/vidyut-jammwal-s-khuda-haafiz-chapter-2-s-release-date-out-film-clash-doctor-g-and-nikamma-1073802">Vidyut Jammwal</a> and Shivaleeka Oberoi do a decent job as Sameer and Nargis, however Sheeba Chaddha as the antagonist Thakur ji steals the show. There is probably no role or emotion that she can't ace on the big screen. Dibyendu Bhattacharya as Rashid Qasai lives up to his part, while Rajesh Tailang’s character of journalist Ravi Kumar could have been used further. Though in his limited screen time, Tailang plays the part to the T. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Overall, Khuda Haafiz 2 – Agni Pariksha has a purpose but lacks direction. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/khuda-haafiz-2-agni-pariksha-review-vidyut-jammwal-shivaleeka-oberois-film-has-purpose-lacks-direction</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1157756</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2022 06:38:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vikram Movie Review: Kamal Haasan starrer is a visual delight with monster action blocks &amp; BMG]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/vikram_movie_review_kamal_haasan_pinkvilla.jpg"></img><p><strong>Watch Vikram movie trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p>

While the second instalment of the franchise starring </span><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/photos/bhool-bhulaiyaa-2-screening-kiara-advani-clicked-sidharth-malhotra-kartik-aaryan-looks-dapper-pics-1099197" style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Kartik Aaryan</a><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">, </span><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/celebrity-style/kiara-advani-goes-chic-parade-maxi-dress-jj-valayas-zebra-printed-saree-yay-or-nay-1096093" style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Kiara Advani</a><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">, and Tabu manage to retain the thrills and chills from part one, this story is completely different from the original - barring Manjulika.</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 largely revolves around strangers Ruhan Randhawa (Aaryan) and Reet Rathore (Advani), who meet at a snowy region and decide to spend some time at a music festival, which helps them avoid a fatal accident. But destiny then leads them straight to an abandoned castle, where bigger challenges await the duo - one of which is Manjulika. While part one was a psychological thriller with elements of horror, this one gives the main antagonist a face. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Anees Bazmee is known for his comedy films like the Welcome franchise, Singh Is Kinng, and No Entry - so the comic elements in Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 doesn’t really come across as a surprise because of the director’s hold on the genre. However, the horror sequences in this sequel also manage to stand out. He has not resorted to jump scares, but has used several elements to make his scenes unique. For instance, a puzzle sequence that stays true to the title of the film. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">A director is only enabled further by a team of good writers, in this case being Aakash Kaushik, who has penned the story and screenplay. While the story does have its minor flaws, especially in the climax which seemed a bit dragged, but overall <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/trade-tutor-why-bollywood-desperately-needs-bhool-bhulaiyaa-2-work-box-office-1094754">Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2</a> manages to hold your attention. Dialogues written by Farhad Samji and Aakash Kaushik land well, while DOP Manu Anand’s lens captures the right emotions. Another most important element in a horror-comedy is the background music, and Sandeep Shirodkar does a great job at that. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Ofcourse, background music from the original comes handy at many junctures, which gives the film a nostalgic value. Editor Bunty Nagi has given a smooth flow to the film, while art director Ajay Verekar and production designer Rajat Poddar help elevate the genre requirements of the film. Mukesh Chhabra’s casting is bang on. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Speaking of the performances, Kartik, Kiara and Tabu live up to their parts, especially the leading pair’s onscreen chemistry is one to look out for. Supporting cast ace their characters well, making one wonder if there is anything that Sanjay Mishra, Rajpal Yadav, Ashwini Kalsekar, Rajesh Sharma and Govind Namdeo can’t do. Amar Upadhyay and Milind Gunaji perform well, but their parts inherently seem limited. Samarth Chauhan as Potlu is bound to win a lot of hearts. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Overall, the film has a mass appeal and the potential to bring the audience back into the theatres. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/bhool-bhulaiyaa-2-review-kartik-aaryan-kiara-advani-and-tabu-starrer-has-thrills-and-chills-1099234</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1099234</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 18:06:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thar Review: Anil Kapoor, Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor &amp; other performances are impressive but predictable plot isn't]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/anil_kapoor_harsh_varrdhan_kapoor_other_performances_are_impressive_but_predictable_plot_isnt_0.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Name:</strong> Thar</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Director:</strong> Raj Singh Chaudhary</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Cast:</strong> Anil Kapoor, Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor, Fatima Sana Shaikh, Satish Kaushik, Jitendra Joshi</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Release Platform:</strong> Netflix</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Rating:</strong> 2.5 / 5</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Let me begin by stating that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/anupam-kher-reviews-anil-kapoor-and-harsh-varrdhan-kapoors-thar-calls-it-intriguing-1083348">Thar</a> is a visual spectacle (credit: DOP Shreya Dev Dube) that features large barren landscapes, abandoned forts and unsettled villages as important components in the narrative that is set in the 80s. It has all the right elements that are required for a neo-Western thriller, but is only marred by a predicted plot. Anil Kapoor plays Surekha an inspector craving for a professional growth, and sees an opportunity when he investigates a gruesome murder of a local in his area. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">The story intertwines when Siddharth (played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/exclusive-harsh-varrdhan-kapoor-turning-producer-thar-im-happy-many-people-dont-have-luxury-1082286">Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor</a>), an antique dealer, appears in the desert town and how their paths cross as both entities try to achieve their respective goals. The first few visuals of the large terrain, observant locals, and a sleepy town combined with a terrific title song composed by Shashwat Sachdev immediately transports you to Munabao, Rajasthan where this Raj Singh Chaudhary directorial is set. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">While those visuals remain consistent throughout the narrative, what doesn’t is the pace of the film. It rightfully spends the first few minutes of its approx 100 minutes run in establishing the characters, later picks up pace, but is slowed down again, especially during the peak investigation phase, where one would usually expect more thrill and speed. In fact, these important junctures are distracted by a few dacoits, an addition to the narrative which seemed unnecessary to me. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Writer-director Raj, editor Aarti Bajaj, and additional screenplay writers Yogesh Dabuwalla and Anthony Catino could have focused more on sharpening this portion. Dialogues have been penned by Anurag Kashyap, and most of them are able to express the situations well. Anil Kapoor’s “Pata nahin mujhe aisa kyun lagta hai ki yeh picture Gabbar ke baare mein nahin hai. Ho sakta hai yeh sab kuch Thakur ne kiya ho, ya phir Jai aur Veeru, aur kya pata Basanti?,” was the star dialogue from the trailer, but its impact fissles out in the movie because of the predicted storyline. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Background score by Ajay Jayanthi adds a lot of value to Thar’s narrative. Speaking of the performances, truly everyone has lived up to their parts. While Anil Kapoor’s performance as a cop is effortless, Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor shines in his layered role. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/thar-fatima-sana-shaikh-calls-anil-kapoor-her-support-system-says-they-had-easy-relationship-1080986">Fatima Sana Shaikh</a> has given a controlled performance as Chetna, while Jitendra Joshi’s act as Panna proves that there is nothing that he can’t aptly play on screen. Satish Kaushik and Mukti Mohan’s performances also stand out. All the actors have been perfectly cast, credit for which goes to casting director Gautam Kishanchandani. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Thar is not only a thriller, but also has an important message at the end. Overall the film had immense potential and manages to retain a lot of it too, but what disappoints is the lack of enough twists, predictable turns and dispensable additions to the story. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/thar-review-anil-kapoor-harsh-varrdhan-kapoor-other-performances-are-impressive-predictable-plot-isnt</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1083561</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 09:59:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Operation Romeo Movie Review: Sharad Kelkar and co. shine in an otherwise pointless thriller]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/operation_romeo_movie_review.jpg"></img><div><strong><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Check out the trailer below: </span></strong></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/operation-romeo-movie-review-sharad-kelkar-and-co-shine-otherwise-pointless-thriller-1074019</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1074019</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 06:45:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dasvi Review: Abhishek Bachchan, Nimrat Kaur and Yami Gautam starrer has purpose but lacks focus  ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/abhishek_bachchan_dasvi_review_main.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Name:</strong> Dasvi</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Director: </strong>Tushar Jalota</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Cast: </strong>Abhishek Bachchan, Nimrat Kaur, Yami Gautam</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Release Platforms:</strong> Jio Cinema and Netflix</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><strong>Rating: </strong>2.5 / 5</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Usually, we come across three types of films - one which is made to purely entertain, the other that has a message, and the third that strikes a balance between the two. Dasvi largely falls in the second category. It’s a film with a purpose, which also makes a sincere attempt to entertain. Though whether it manages to achieve the latter is debatable. Revolving around a flamboyant Chief Minister played by Abhishek Bachchan, Tushar Jalota’s directorial traces his story from being a corrupt and brash politician to a more open-minded, sensitive one. His wife played by Nimrat Kaur, and Yami Gautam’s cop character play two distinctive roles in this journey. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">The film makes a statement on the importance of education, and Abhishek’s character arc manages to achieve that. However, in an attempt to attain that goal, the story, especially the relatability of the characters, gets lost during the narrative. In an attempt to make the roles impactful, writers Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair and Sandeep Laeyzell ended up making them more caricaturish. Especially Abhishek and Nimrat’s parts that comply with every stereotype that you can imagine about their respective roles. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Some actions of the characters are extremely forced too, especially <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/dasvi-song-ghani-trip-out-abhishek-bachchan-s-haryanavi-swagger-super-high-trippy-dance-number-1061179">Abhishek</a> and Nimrat’s onscreen equation seem very superficial. There was an attempt to establish a connection between the characters and the audience by adding some pop culture references, but ultimately the effort seems half-baked. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><a href="https://pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/abhishek-bachchan-reveals-aaradhya-s-reaction-dasvi-s-trailer-says-nervous-show-dasvi-family-1060014">Dasvi</a> has humour in parts, especially in the first half. But a lot of work could have been done in the second half of the movie. While background score helps to lift up the scenes, songs composed by Sachin Jigar are forgettable. The film also seems a bit rushed in the end, especially the last half-an-hour. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">As far as the performances are concerned, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/liya-abhishek-bachchans-film-dasvi-will-inspire-you-follow-your-dreams-1058453">Abhishek Bachchan</a> does well as the assertive Chief Minister Ganga Ram Chaudhary. He could have done much more with the part, if the writing had backed it. Nimrat Kaur shines as Bimla Devi, portraying all the layers of the character to the T. Yami Gautam as Jyoti Deswal gives her all to the character, but isn’t very convincing in the part. All three got the Haryanvi dialect right, thanks to coach Sunita Sharma. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Overall, when you see the film it is evident that the makers wanted to strike the right balance between conveying a message and entertaining the audience, but it ends up being more preachy than anything else.</span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/dasvi-review-abhishek-bachchan-nimrat-kaur-and-yami-gautam-starrer-has-purpose-lacks-focus-1062238</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1062238</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 18:31:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Attack Review: John Abraham, Jacqueline, Rakul Preet Singh film is a good mix of entertainment with reasoning]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/attack_review_main_0.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">As far as the performances are concerned, John is convincing as Arjun. Moreover, it seemed like he really had a blast playing the character, which comes across on screen. Jacqueline made a mark in her limited screen time, though her character graph seemed surprisingly similar to another recent release of hers - Bachchhan Paandey. Rakul Preet Singh played her part to the T, while the rest of the cast including Prakash Raj, Kiran Kumar, and Ratna Pathak Shah provided apt support to the narrative. Rajit Kapur’s performance stood out, while Elham Ehsas as the antagonist truly steals the show. Lakshya Raj Anand as a director is extremely promising, and can be one of the most sought-after filmmakers in the future. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">So overall, keep an open mind, don’t compare, and give the film a chance.

Jr NTR roars like a young tiger, whereas Ram Charan carries his character with utmost grace, bringing in the aspect of the calm before the storm in his eyes. The two heroes compliment each other rather than competing and get their moment of glory in the narrative. However, it&rsquo;s JR. NTR who has a slight edge over Charan as his character has better scope to perform. The young Tiger also gets his Hindi diction to the T, with right emphasis at the right emotional moments. Even Charan has put in good efforts for his Hindi diction. Ajay Devgn has a pivotal appearance in the narrative forming the heart of RRR, and as soon as he enters the screen, you realise why only him from Bollywood could have done justice to the part. Alia Bhatt too has a short appearance in the film as Ram Charan&rsquo;s love interest, Sita, however, her talent is left unexplored here with generic character in the second half, and a limited screen time. The rest of the ensemble do justice to their respective parts.</div>

<div>All in all, RRR celebrates Indian cinema in all its glory. SS Rajamouli brings in his own vision of creating big canvas drama with all the larger-than-life action around a routine tale of friendship. And it&rsquo;s his conviction and ability to think big that takes the world of RRR to the next level despite some limitations at the script level in terms of a simplistic core conflict. Nonetheless, RRR has the best action sequences to offer in an Indian film with an unimaginable interval block and a roaring finale. Be assured, despite some flaws in the second half, you will be invested in this big canvas world of Rajamouli in the times when India was a &ldquo;Sone Ki Chidiya&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s rightfully termed India&rsquo;s biggest action drama.</div>

Which is why there are some films that you go to watch with zero expectations, but then come out of the theatre completely surprised. Akshay Kumar, Kriti Sanon, Jacqueline Fernandez and Arshad Warsi starrer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bachchan-pandey-rrr-attack-kgf-2-heropanti-2-box-office-gears-5-action-films-7-weeks-1026944">Bachchhan Paandey</a> did just that for me. Kumar plays the titular role in this Farhad Samji directorial, and the character becomes a subject of interest for Kriti Sanon's Myra Devekar, who aspires to make a film on the crime lord’s life. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">She along with her aspiring actor friend Vishu (played by Warsi) reach Baghwa to convince Bachchhan Paandey, unknown to the fact that deadly challenges await the duo in the dangerous land. Of course, all of it has been portrayed in an entertaining way. What starts as a cat and mouse chase between the artist and her muse, soon becomes a tug of war between love and hatred, fear and kindness. While the filmmaker attempts this transition it doesn’t lose control on the overall entertainment. However, some of the jokes do fall flat, and a few even seem dated. Some work could have been done on that.</span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/abhishek-bachchan-and-chunky-pandey-feature-akshay-kritis-bachchhan-paandey-heres-truth-1044670">Bachchhan Paandey</a> is an action-comedy, and one would expect to see a lot more action in the film. But the sequences that are there, are brilliantly choreographed by Anl Arasu, staying true to Pandey’s brutal persona. They are not unique, but interestingly picturised for sure. Background music by Julius Packiam adds character to the narrative, while editing by Charu Shree Roy is sharp and to the point. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Usually these genres tend to vary between the first half and the second half in terms of entertainment, mostly compromising it along the way. But Bachchhan Paandey overall manages to hold onto that and large credit for it should go to the screenplay penned by Sajid Nadiadwala, while Farhad Samji manages to bring those scenes to life on the big screen with his direction. Yes, the film does have the old theme of ‘love can make and destroy an individual’, but what makes Bachchhan Paandey’s journey different is his quirks and characteristics. Though you don’t really end up falling in love with the character, as nothing really justifies his past wrongdoings. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">As for the performances, Akshay Kumar is brilliant and stands out. He seems to have had a blast playing the character, and it comes across. Kriti Sanon too has lived up well to her part, not going overboard with emotions at any point. She has truly come a long way as an actor. Jacqueline Fernandez gives a decent performance in her limited screen time, while Arshad Warsi shines in every scene. Though I wish more layers were added to his part. An attempt was made too, but it seemed half baked. Pankaj Tripathi as acting coach Bhavesh Bhopla has an eventful entry, and an entertaining exit too. There may be hardly anything that Tripathi can’t really pull off onscreen. The rest of the supporting cast including, Sanjay Mishra, Abhimanyu Singh, Saharsh Kumar Shukla, and Prateik Babbar live up to their parts. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Interestingly, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/bachchhan-paandey-akshay-kumar-protects-kriti-sanon-mob-they-reach-delhi-jacqueline-arshad-1046118">Bachchhan Paandey</a> in its own way pays a tribute to the other anti heroes of Bollywood, as well as celebrates the madness of cinema. Yes, from a genre point of view the film had a scope of improvement, but it also has its heart in the right place.</span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/bachchhan-paandey-review-akshay-kumar-kriti-sanon-jacqueline-starrer-has-its-heart-right-place-1048541</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1048541</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 08:34:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Kashmir Files Review: Anupam Kher shines in the film that creates an impact but lacks balance]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/anupam_kher_shines_in_the_film_that_creates_an_impact_but_lacks_balance.jpg"></img><div><strong>Name: The Kashmir Files</strong></div>

<div><strong>Cast: Anupam Kher, Mithun Chakraborty, Darshan Kumar</strong></div>

<div><strong>Director: Vivek Agnihotri</strong></div>

<div><strong>Release: Theatres&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div><strong>Rating: 3 / 5</strong></div>

<div>Many filmmakers usually take a safer, sometimes indecisive route to depict unfortunate real-life incidents. However, director Vivek Agnihotri goes straight for the impact in The Kashmir Files, which revolves around the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus from the valley in the early 1990s because of a rise in the Islamic militancy, and the effect that it has created on the group ever since. Right from the first scene, Agnihotri depicts the injustice that prevailed in the region, and from thereon showcases a series of graphic, gruesome moments that are bound to make you uneasy in the chair.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Weaving several real-life incidents together, the director narrates the story from the lens of Pushkar Nath Pandit (played by Anupam Kher), who himself is a victim of the exodus, and strives hard to get justice and stability not only for himself, but for his remaining grieving family, and for the community as a whole too. Through the incident, Agnihotri touches upon several other pivotal points such as the role of the media and the government at the time, the politics in the region, impact on the daily needs of an individual including food and medicine, changing face of the near and dear ones, the aftermath, and the perception of the tragedy in today&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Full marks to Agnihotri and his team for the extensive research. However, while in the first half one is able to connect with the human story of Pushkar Nath Pandit, in the second half it loses that connection because of the filmmaker&rsquo;s attempt to highlight so many angles at once. Moreso, while one sees an attempt to create a balance on point of views in the narrative, it mostly comes across only by the end and seems largely missing in most parts of the story.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Some might even describe a few of the scenes as &lsquo;too graphic&rsquo;, but it does enable the director to convey his message of &lsquo;Right To Justice&rsquo;, especially because of the ordeal that the community has experienced. The film has been shot in Kashmir and staying true to the location helps add a lot more authenticity and feel to the narrative. The flow of the film is edited well, while the dialogues stay true to the region and subtitles come in handy at times when you struggle to understand the language.&nbsp;</div>

<div>As for the performances, Anupam Kher shines through the film. His performance is impactful, yet controlled. Four other characters who play an important role in Pushkar Nath Pandit&rsquo;s and then of his grandson Krishna&rsquo;s (played by Darshan Kumar) journey are played by Mithun Chakraborty, Puneet Issar, Prakash Belawadi and Atul Srivastava. While all four live up to their parts, Chakraborty&rsquo;s performance in one confrontational sequence with Krishna is a memorable one.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Kumar plays his part well, but it is the climax scene where his performance truly comes through. Pallavi Joshi is phenomenal as Radhika, however I wish a little more background of the character was shown (except one scene in a photograph) that explains her actions.

<div>Yes, Vivek Agnihotri&rsquo;s The Kashmir Files largely lacks another point of view, but it does manage to convey the plight of the Kashmiri Hindus and the sorrow that they still experience.&nbsp;</div>

The movie revolves around a dispirited athlete Savi (Pannu) who finds hope and love in her impetuous boyfriend Satya (Bhasin). However, they later fall in a situation where Savi races against time to save her beau, who carelessly loses a mobster’s cash in a local bus. What happens next, is for you to watch in the film.  </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Looop Lapeta begins at an obtuse pace which grows from confusion to frustration for a while. The latter may be because you want to know what’s finally going to happen in that situation, and the screenplay takes a handsome amount of time to reach there. However, once the story does reach its final leg it comes with an important message, which is quite basic, often forgetful too and conveyed in a fun way. In a repetitive screenplay the biggest challenge is to keep the audience hooked , and director Aakash Bhatia and his technical team manage to do that brilliantly with experimental editing (by Priyank Prem Kumar) and captivating background score (by Rahul Pais and Nariman Khambata). </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">The film has been set in Goa, and while the location is important to the story, the locales don't come across as new or unexplored. While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news-gossip/kapil-sharma-show-kapil-sharma-teases-taapsee-pannu-having-no-idea-about-her-bank-balance-1011009">Taapse</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/netflix-indias-yeh-kaali-kaali-ankhein-renewed-season-2-tahir-raj-bhasin-thrilled-return-1012758">Tahir</a> are leading this film from the front, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Rajendra Chawla, Sameer Kevin Roy and Dibyendu Bhattacharya, among many others play pivotal supporting parts. All the actors have lived up to their roles, but Tahir Raj Bhasin’s performance truly stands out from the lot. His versatility as an actor comes across brilliantly. I even loved how Bhattacharya’s character - Victor - was conceived by the writers and portrayed by the actor. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">Looop Lapeta is an official Hindi adaptation of filmmaker Tom Tykwer’s 1998 German film, Run Lola Run. However, we won’t get into any comparisons. As a stand alone film, Looop Lapeta does fall flat in certain comic scenes and the chase sequences seem lengthy at times too, but ultimately the film manages to hold its ground because of the overall story, edgy performances and strong technical support. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">You may not want to see this film on loop, but it definitely is a one time watch. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/looop-lapeta-review-not-loop-taapsee-pannu-tahir-raj-bhasin-starrer-one-time-watch-sure-1014756</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-1014756</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 08:46:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[36 Farmhouse Review: Subhash Ghai’s tone-deaf comedy drama elicits major disappointment and zero laughs]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/36-farmhouse-main.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex: 10.5755px;">There is Vijay Raaz, who plays Raunak Singh, the eldest of the three sons, who wants to inherit their rich and ailing mother’s property.

<p><strong>Director: Vipul Shah and Mozez Singh</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cast: Shefali Shah, Kirti Kulhari, Vishal Jethwa, Aditya Srivastava, Ram Kapoor</strong></p>

<p><strong>Platform: Disney+Hotstar</strong></p>

<p>We are living in the times when human trial of vaccine is no longer a technical term. Just at that point of time, comes a series that takes us through the dark world running in the medical sector that has just one aim &ndash; make money &ndash; even if that&rsquo;s at the cost of innocent lives. Vipul Shah and Mozez Singh come up with a story that is set against the backdrop of medical politics, where the stakeholders are desperate to take their newest discovery in the market to bring about a revolution.</p>

<p>While the pharma sector anticipates it to be a game changer in medical science, it&rsquo;s only the doctors and scientists working towards the development, who are aware about the side effects of the medicine on their lives. In the fight between ethics and desperation for money, it&rsquo;s the latter that wins when a section in the community of science are ready to risk their reputation for quick money. The director duo takes no time in establishing the premise of Human, as the complexities are introduced from the first frame.</p>

<p>While the initial parts of the first episodes are spent in establishing the world of vaccines and the probable repercussions, the characters and their intentions get clear in the following portions of the series. By the end of the second episode, one is exposed to the gray elements of almost all key characters, and the politics involved in the entire game of vaccine trial. The start of the series is promising as the makers succeed in transporting the viewers to the dark world of the medical industry. Yes, there are a few hiccups, in terms of prolonged shot taking and narrative going slow in certain segments, but the world in totality is intriguing enough to keep the interest intact.</p>

<p>The camera work and shot taking is neat, whereas the dialogues too amps up the dramatic quotient in the narrative. The production values are fine, so is the background score which creates exactly the kind of ambience that a series like Human demanded.</p>

<p>Talking of performances, Shefali Shah gets into the shoes of her multi-layered character with perfection. While she is introduced as a woman who doesn&rsquo;t take a step wrong, the same eventually transforms into the dark side of someone desperate for power. Kirti Kulhari is rather subdued in the initial two episodes, however, one expects a metamorphosis of her character too as the story progresses forward. After Mardaani, Vishal Jethwa seems to be in his elements again, however, this time around, instead of being the antagonist, the young actor get&rsquo;s to play a local rowdy taking the wrong path for quick money. Aditya Srivastava and Ram Kapoor do justice in their limited screen presence, so does the rest of the cast.</p>

<p>All in all, Human starts with a bang as it successfully establishes the dark side of the medical world in the first two episodes. It rides on solid drama with the political aspect bringing in the thrills to the story, and one expects ample twists and turns through the narrative that revolves around the gray characters. While the set up is interesting, the fate of the show depends on the turn of events as the story progresses.</p>

<p><strong>PS: Opinion strictly based on the opening two episodes of the series </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Now this storyline isn’t something that we haven’t heard or seen before, whether it was in Mani Ratnam’s 1995 film Bombay, in Nagraj Manjule’s 2016 Marathi film - Sairat, and in many other films that have been made over the years around the same subject. The basic premise of director Devanshu Singh’s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/14-phere-trailer-out-vikrant-massey-kriti-kharbanda-starrer-tale-two-weddings-twist-809590" target="_blank">14 Phere</a> is also no different, however, what separates it from the rest is the treatment. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/vikrant-massey-s-fiancee-sheetal-thakur-pens-heartfelt-note-actor-s-birthday-thank-god-you-were-born-684223" target="_blank">Vikrant Massey</a>’s Sanjay and Kriti Kharbanda’s Aditi meet in college, fall in love, get placed in the same office after graduation, and even start living together. Everything is hunky-dory, until the day Sanjay is called back home with an intention to get him married. Thankfully, he raises an objection but with a lie, and what happens after that is for you to see in the film. The filmmaker has attempted to convey a message on the caste system in India, and the interesting part about it is that it's not on your face. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Humour has been used as a major tool throughout the narrative, and while it works in some places, it also falls flat on certain other occasions - especially in the climax. Also, the means through which Sanjay and Aditi convince their parents to let them marry is not entirely believable, however, it’s entertaining so you won’t really mind it. Manan Sagar’s crisp editing also saves the film from becoming an unnecessary long watch, while <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/14-phere-actress-made-vikrant-massey-s-heart-skip-beat-during-shoot-hioot-his-upcoming-film-824026" target="_blank">Vikrant Massey</a>’s effortless performance keeps you hooked through the film’s approx 1 hour 51 minutes run. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: 16px;">Kriti Kharbanda has also given a pleasant performance, especially in the part where her character meets and bonds with Vikrant’s onscreen mother Sarla (played by Yamini Das) for the first time. Her eyes do most of the talking here. However, in the scenes with Vikrant, the latter does overshadow her performance. Furthermore, it looked like Gauahar Khan was having a blast playing Zubina aka ‘Delhi ki Meryl Streep’. She does go over the top at some points, but more or less keeps the humour quotient high throughout the film. This movie required a strong supporting cast, and everyone right from Jameel Khan and Vineet Kumar to Yamini Das, played their parts to the T. Songs are easily forgettable, and none of them really stand out. </span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">14 Phere does has its share of flaws, but overall it makes for pleasant viewing. A one-time watch is a rather apt description for this social comedy-drama. </span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/14-phere-movie-review-vikrant-massey-kriti-kharbanda-s-not-so-unusual-love-story-pleasant-watch-825736</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-825736</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 04:40:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Toofaan Movie Review: Farhan Akhtar and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s film is a storm worth embracing]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/toofan_0.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> <br />Despite the film being predictable, it's equally pleasant. Thanks to a solid performance by each and every member of the cast and the able hands of Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra.  Farhan Akhtar delivers a convincing performance as a boxer who is in search of dignity and love. His efforts to get into the shape and demeanour of a boxer pays through. In fact, it’s time he offers an unconditional royalty to his director Rakeysh for giving him two roles which demanded a totally different level of fitness.<br /> <br />Mrunal Thakur is like carrot cake with vanilla ice-cream (watch the film to understand the connection). She delivers a sweet yet entirely yummy performance. Hussain Dalal is a treat to watch. He packs a punch during both emotional as well as funny parts of the film. Paresh Rawal and Supriya Pathak are actors who are masters of their craft, and hardly require validation of a critic on their performance.<br /> <br />Despite the slacktivism over whether you should revenge-watch or totally ban Farhan Akhtar starrer Toofaan, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s film is a feel good sports drama that will keep you entertained.

He tries to salvage the film through his acting skills. Randeep is raw and definitely essays the brutal character efficiently; although, his character has no depth to offer. In fact, the characters could have balanced the film better and made the confrontations more engaging.  </span></span><br /> </div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Disha Patani has been used as a glam doll but her character turns more into an interruption, which is disappointing.

Of course, there are scenes when Jackie Shroff surprises the audience but the character itself is off-mark and written to the point of lampooning a senior officer.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By end of the film, I wonder why to review the film but “job hai toh karna toh padega…” After all, we also have made a commitment to the audience to honestly review films.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/radhe-movie-review-salman-khan-s-film-fails-impress-or-entertain-disha-patanis-act-mere-interruption-735444</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-735444</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 May 2021 09:46:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sulthan Movie Review: This Karthi starrer is a masala action film that is rich in emotions ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/sulthan_movie_review_this_karthi-starrer_is_a_masala_action_film_that_is_rich_in_emotions_.png"></img><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Movie: Sulthan </span><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Cast: Karthi, Lal, Rashmika Mandanna and others</span><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Director: Bakkiyaraj Kannan</span><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Rating: 3/5</span></span></span><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /> </p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Sethupathi runs an overground mafia-style gang that is into rendering instant justice, and mercilessly hacking the goons of the opposite side. About one hundred ultra-loyal musclemen assist him in his mission. But when a courageous Commissioner takes over, the gang's days may just be numbered. This is when the conscientious Sulthan takes it upon himself the task of transforming the violent nature of his now-dead father's yes-men. As destiny would have it, a village in trouble is waiting for him to make them put their abilities to a good purpose. </span></span></p><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Karthi strikes the right chord in the role of a morally aware young man for whom bloodbath is not an option. When he has to take on a corporate villain (Nawab Shah) and his puppet (Ramachandra Raju of 'KGF: Chapter 1' fame), he becomes an omnipotent masala hero. At the same time, what sets him apart from the run-of-the-mill brave cine hero is that his heart genuinely beats for peace. A parallel exists in Prabhas' character in 'Mirchi' (2013), which came with a somewhat similar theme. </span></span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The film does itself a favour by making the audience feel the references to Mahabharata. In keeping with the flavour of the season (thanks to Mahesh Babu's 'Maharshi' et al), the film forks out the idea that farming is an elixir. Just till the land and become a good human being before the first crop is harvested. This is becoming jaded of late but in the context of 'Sulthan', we sort of buy into it. </span></span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The love track, involving Karthi and Rashmika Mandanna (who has a purpose in life, despite being stalked by the hero), is smartly milked to become a red herring for the rowdy 'annalu'. </span></span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Unlike 'Mirchi', 'Sulthan' does a lot of humanizing of its goondas. In doing so, it tries to be manipulative. We are told that the macabre rowdies, who are normalized by the hero terming them as 'annalu' (brothers), are mere fools. They indeed are fools, but the film tries to push the narrative that they don't have agency. Because they are Sulthan's sycophants, they are made to look more helpless than they actually are. Nobody put a gun on their heads to take up gangsterism, right? </span></span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">But this is a minor complaint. At a time when most films are caricaturizing rowdies, this one at least uses them to deepen the story. How they react to the aroma of blood in the 'silent' fight is hilarious. Yogi Babu's comedy draws laughs. Yuvan Shankar Raja's BGM and Sathyan Sooryan's cinematography assist the film ably. </span></span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Since rowdyism is rampant in the film, the wise thing would have been to set the story in a bygone era perhaps. Gang wars are rare to come by in 2021 and so the contemporariness of the film is in question. But this is a minor irritant in an otherwise well-made film. </span></span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">'Sulthan', all in all, stands out for toying with emotions like guilt and parental love, and themes like redemption, loyalty and fighting for freedom. A character makes a journey from affection to betrayal. When the hero defeats a muscleman in a one-to-one combat, it is nothing more than a pyrrhic victory to him. There are dramatic moments that this film revels in. Chances are high that the Tamil audience will warm up to it, while the Telugus will have their issues. </span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/sulthan-movie-review-karthi-starrer-masala-action-film-rich-emotions-681374</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-681374</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Apr 2021 14:23:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tribhanga Movie Review: Kajol, Tanvi Azmi and Mithila Palkar deliver a choice you must make this weekend]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/tribhanga_movie_review_kajol_tanvi_azmi_and_mithila_palkar_deliver_a_choice_you_must_make_this_weekend.png"></img><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: 16px;">The elixir of life is that it’s the choices we make that shapes us, and those around.  Renuka highlights that all choices are a mere bargain through an engrossing screenplay – and sometimes your win is somebody’s loss.</span></div><div style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is one of the films that doesn’t drain the audience.

Although, we wish he had a bit more screen time and space in the script. Ranvir Shorey as a tough cop is on the point, funny and ruthless.</span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: 16px;">The dialogue writer deserves a mention too. They will strike you when you least expect, and they are funny and entertaining. It has all the elements for a caper comedy.

It’s the type of film that gains attention more from word of mouth publicity than scores of glitz and money-driven launch events. Perhaps the digital launch will do more justice to the film than a theatre launch could have since the audience is now glued and open to experience low-budget, high-on-content films.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/lootcase-movie-review-comedy-riot-s-worth-time-553608</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-553608</guid><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 09:16:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shakuntala Devi Movie Review: Vidya Balan delivers a calculated performance; raises experience to n-th power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/71df7628-a801-4dd9-8a13-7382d21e6d91.jpg"></img><div style="font-family: HelveticaNeue; font-sizex: 12px;"><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">While the journey of arithmetic genius is one pillar of the film, the other is Shakuntala’s relationship with her daughter Anupama Banerji (Sanya Malhotra). Sanya, who is one of the underrated actors of the industry, adeptly plays the daughter who is continuously upset for not having a normal childhood. But as Shakuntala says: why be normal, when you can be amazing. Sanya manages to give a measured performance; convincing the audience that her perspective is not entirely wrong. Depending on which phase of life one is, the makers and actors ensure that you swing like a pendulum to decide who’s right and who’s not. </span><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Anu Menon has ensured to showcase equality means there is no superior or inferior gender. Though this film revolves mostly around the delicate mother-and-daughter relationship, the contribution of a loving father and husband is never underplayed. </span><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">That is why another bright spot of the film is Jisshu Sengupta and Amit Sadh. It’s nice to see that the makers haven’t bucked down to the trend of showing all Indian men as patriarchal. Director Anu Menon entrusts two brilliant actors Jishu and Amit to handle the responsibility to play a supportive partner that every woman desires and deserves. Jisshu Sengupta as Paritosh Banerji is effortless, vulnerable, but lovable. Amit Sadh, who recently impressed with his intense performance in Breathe is back as an adorable guy next door. His portrayal as Ajay quickly settles on-screen and is seemingly consistent. </span><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><br style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" /><span style="caret-color: rgb(34, 34, 34); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Shakuntala Devi is a treat to watch during the lockdown with your family members.

At one juncture, the engraved sexism of the audience appals them to counter it with unjustifiable justification. Film Thappad is no less. It’s a beautiful depiction of what exists in society.

Kangana’s chemistry with Jassie looks real. Her bonding with Adi makes you believe in her character even more. Jassie Gill has done his best as a supportive husband. His decision to underplay the role adds more layers to the film. Richa Chadha as Meenu is entertaining, funny and makes you wish for a friend like her.

Without beating around the bush, Destin and Andrew Latham adapt a screenplay that stays true to the material and at the same time, doesn’t tarnish the emotional quality. The finest example of this in <em>Just Mercy</em> is when Herbert Richardson is tied to the electric chair awaiting his death while the other inmates start banging on their close prison doors supporting him. An emotional gut-stirring sequence that was so beautifully shot and looked after, that the silence that follows is what makes this film a must-watch. It hits you where it has to but also gives you a breather with some funny lines, here and there. This time, it’s the story that rides the entire cinematic experience. You won’t remember the background score or the Alabama greenery or the editing cuts, it’s the story and the characters you leave the theatre with. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">At the end of the day, <em>Just Mercy</em> makes you feel the pain but you also feel the pleasure when justice is finally served.

You get beyond predictable and plenty of jump scare sequences that do the exact opposite of frightening us. The Grudge was made with the intention to bring in more fans to the horror franchise but unfortunately, the end does not justify the means.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Going along the lines of its predecessors Ju-On: The Grudge and the Sarah Michelle Gellar starrer The Grudge, this Nicolas Pesce directorial chronicles the horrors surrounding the Reyburn house and the various family murders that lead back to the ’prime‘ real estate landmark. While the investigation of Fiona Landers killing her entire family is shut as a cold case, the newly assigned detective Detective Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough) takes it upon herself to solve the Reyburn house mystery when a mysterious body is found inside a car, obviously linked to the Reyburn house. The biggest mistake she makes enters the haunted house of horrors as she follows the same path of those who are now deceased; engulfed by the madness of the evil spirits following her every move. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">When it comes to the performances, Andrea tries her best to inculcate some emotional aspect to her good cop just trying to solve a mystery persona but is failed by the shoddy script. The most interesting character in this horror flick is Detective Goodman (Oscar-nominated actor Demián Bichir), who is the only smart one to not enter the haunted house unlike his partner Detective Wilson (William Sadler) whose descent into madness triggers him to stay away. At every given turn, we’re made to believe that Goodman is somehow related to the murders taking place. Whether it be referring to his Catholic side or even the entire Wilson storyline of whether it was fact or fiction. However, until the very end, you are left wondering what was the reason for Goodman’s existence in the plotline if all he was relegated to was an outsider peeking into the story like the audience. Even the scream queen Lin Shaye as Faith Matheson can’t give us the creeps this time! Jon Cho and Betty Gilpin as Peter and Nina Spencer add a tinge of humanity to what could have been a clear cut supernatural spectrum but again, it’s the weak script that ruins the fun. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The horror genre is such an overused concept that it’s extremely difficult to be unpredictable. Unfortunately, The Grudge falls into said predictable category. It has all the trademark aspects - a haunted house, evil spirits, flicking lights, spacy closets, characters with families and so forth. While the background score gives is that warm, guttural feeling of eeriness, the jump scare editing is a major buzzkill. For someone who scares easily, even you will be left saying wtf! The Grudge has nothing new to offer... not the storyline nor the creative ways to scare people. Even the slightly horror-induces parts all have made its way to the trailer for the films. What’s even more disappointing is how anti-climatic the horror flick was towards the end leaving you disheartened. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">If you’re looking for a horror film that would be perfect to fill the palates of your scary appetite, we’d recommend rewatching the 2002 Takashi Shimizu classic instead and give this Nicolas Pesce film a skip. Or else you might be the one ending up with a grudge!</span></span></p>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/grudge-movie-review-andrea-riseborough-jon-cho-s-film-scare-less-predictable-snoozefest-496691</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-496691</guid><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2020 10:58:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jumanji: The Next Level Review: The Rock and Kevin Hart's film is a grandiose adventure that deeply entertains]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/jumanji-the-next-level-review-main-image.jpg"></img><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: 16px;">Going back to the action sequences, a lot of effort was put into making it as realistic as it did! The advantage of a video game like Jumanji is that you can play around with the locales and especially the VFX, and they really take it to the next level, no pun intended. From a hoard of ostriches chasing the characters on dune buggies across a desert or even them escaping from mandrills while swaying like Tarzan from easily breakable bridges. <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> is extremely breathtaking to look at visually and must be enjoyed in IMAX only. It's the only way the production value will be done justice.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: 16px;">As grandeur as the set up was, the plotholes were also there. The story is still the same. The picking point of focus was still the same - friendship. But, that doesn't mean it wasn't an enjoyable ride nonetheless. Ultimately, <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> is like a video game; the endgame may still be the same but it's always about the next level, isn't it? If you're looking for a fun, entertaining watch than buckle up and Welcome to Jumanji!</span></p>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/jumanji-next-level-review-rock-and-kevin-harts-film-grandiose-adventure-deeply-entertains-491612</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-491612</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 02:00:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ford v Ferrari Review: Matt Damon &amp; Christian Bale starrer is an adrenaline rush even after the finish line]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/ford-v-ferrari-review-main-image.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">It's pouring rain, and the conditions are anything but flurry but for Miles, it's all about the need for speed. As you veer through lap after lap with Kenny, you're drawn more and more into what happens inside a race car instead of just the glitz of the outside. You're given a microscopic view to the unseen, and that's what sets Ford v Ferrari apart from the rest of the movies, based on the thrill of racing.<br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-sizex: 12px;" /><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-sizex: 12px;" />Ford v Ferrari is basically the outcome of two testosterone-driven companies - Ford and Ferrari - having a grudge match, of whose car is the fastest (no pun intended!) In between the ego-fest, we have acclaimed retired American racecar driver Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), who gets enlisted by Lee Lacocca (Jon Bernthal) under Ford, to come up with a car that could beat Ferrari at the dangerous 24 hour Le Mans in France. Carroll then enlists Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a British sports car engineer with a pension for driving fast cars. Together, we see Carroll and Ken tackle white-collar politics and intricate mechanical problems, to finally get the work done, i.e. bring Ferrari down hard. <br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-sizex: 12px;" /><br style="font-family: Helvetica; font-sizex: 12px;" />Christian is a knockout as the hot-headed Miles, whose character is the right balance between being a genius inside and outside an automobile, but never losing his path thanks to his well-grounded and appreciative family. Whether it be the fierce rush of the driving scenes where Bale does all the talking with his expressive face or even his tender moments with wife Mollie Miles (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter Miles (Noah Jupe). On the other hand, the subtle act is left on the capable shoulders of one Matt Damon as Carroll, who proves yet again to be the dark horse of a well oiled machine. It's almost as if he's the newly built brakes to keep up the Ford GT40. Without him, the movie would lose its charm. Examples are when Shelby has a conversation with Henry Ford II (played profusely to a t by Tracy Letts) and talks back in a respectful manner of why Ken Miles is the only way to win the god damn race. Christian and Matt's bromance in Ford v Ferrari is the heart of the film and there's no doubt about that. As smooth as their chemistry is; they even make a scuffle on the streets with grocery products like a whole loaf of bread wildly entertaining. Bernthal as Lee and Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe are the perfect additions to an all-round supporting cast, who are given strong moments in between. </span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/ford-v-ferrari-review-matt-damon-christian-bale-starrer-adrenaline-rush-even-after-finish-line-485357</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-485357</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2019 01:59:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saand Ki Aankh Movie Review: Much ado about nothing on the inspirational life of underdogs]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/saand_ki_aankh_first_look_main.jpg"></img><p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: 16px;">Bhumi and Taapsee try to carry the story on their shoulders and have done a decent job. Prakash Jha does justice to the role of crude and chauvinistic patriarch of the village. Viineet Kumar leaves an impact and looks natural in his scenes. Yet, the actors were never given an arena where their acting talent could add life to the screenplay. Prakash’s character keeps repeating one dialogue -- yeh toh hona hi tha (this was bound to happen) – encapsulates the feeling of the audience as well, who can easily guess what’s going to happen next. The outstanding life story of these two women has left us inspired. But the film disappoints you with the lack of depth in the story and character sketch.</span></p>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/saand-ki-aankh-movie-review-much-ado-about-nothing-inspirational-life-underdogs-481761</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-481761</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 06:04:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arjun Patiala Movie Review: Diljit Dosanjh, Kriti Sanon starrer rom com fails to entertain]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/arjun_patiala_poster.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The film which starts on an entertaining note then becomes silly and absurd with the direction.

That was what attracted me to the trailer of Yesterday, when I first came across it. A world without The Beatles, oh what an obscure world it would be!</span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Yesterday (there couldn't have been a better title name for a Beatles musical) chronicles the life of struggling singer-songwriter Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), whose song titles range from Dinosaur to Summer Song. Life isn't kind to Jack whose only fan is his childhood friend-zone columned and only fan, Ellie (Lily James). However, after a global blackout and a freak accident, Jack is welcomed into the world where The Beatles don't exist. We then witness a meteoric rise for the singer, who uses the legendary tracks of the Fab Four and calls it his own. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">At the heart of Yesterday, the movie is a romantic musical which happens to use The Beatles as its fodder. Himesh Patel is the apt choice to bring to life the Beatlemania to the new generation. His eccentric, broody performance never dulls your spirits and his voice truly compliments the legacy of The Beatles, without tarnishing or autotuning it. Lily is known for her vibrant personality which she deals with in spades, irrespective of how one-dimensional her character gets. Kate McKinnon plays the power hungry agent Debra Hammer and is the parody of how music agents are projected in real life. Her theatrics seemed a bit put off for the subtle British humour that writer Richard Curtis brings to the table. Ed Sheeran is a welcome presence in the scheme of larger things, and the Hey Dude sequence was pure gold.</span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Danny Boyle, who we all know as the director of Slumdog Millionaire, encashes on the nostalgia factor and fandom of The Beatles to concoct a visually pleasing love story. Music plays a critical aspect in this romance and absolutely ravages through Beatles' greatest hits. A loyal Beatle fan would still get teary-eyed listening to some of the classics like All You Need Is Love and I Want To Hold Your Hand. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Given how musical biopics are all the rage right now, with Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, Yesterday comes as a breath of fresh air because it doesn't take us back to the time of The Beatles. Instead it helps reinvigorate the magic of the band to a whole new generation, and for generations to come.</span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While the plot is intriguing, the storyline tends to divert way more into the love story than The Beatles, which could upset many given the marketing dominance on the band. The dry British humour is equal parts funny but at times, forced as well. But thanks to the heartfelt perfomances by Himesh and Lily, this easy-on-the-eyes flick, deserves a watch. It's the genuine concotion of Danny Boyle's dramatic flare and Richard Curtis' penchant for perfectly-imperfect love stories.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/yesterday-review-himesh-patel-lily-james-concoct-pleasing-love-story-beatles-nostalgia-460701</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-460701</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 09:26:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Malaal Review: Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s golden touch and elixir of 90s romance]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/malaal-movie-review.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Credit should also be given to the music composed by the team of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Shreyas Puranik and Shail Hada and lyrics written by Prashant Ingole, Vimal Kashyab and A M Turaz.

We know Jean Grey for barely a film and to thrust her upon the audience and immediately care for her were parallel lines.

After directing many films, he made SOTY (2012), which of course couldn't recreate the same magic of SRK and Kajol starrer, but still was well received by the audience. And now after 6 years, KJo is back with the sequel to the 2012 film and this time Punit Malhotra of I Hate Love Storys fame helmed the same.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">So talking about SOTY 2, yes, it is again a movie from KJo's cannon and is packed with all larger than life, ostentatious, OTT theatrics and a yawn-worthy twist. The movie opens with Tiger's character Rohan dreaming of being the Student of the Year with his girlfriend Mridula aka Mia (Tara) by his side. But he wakes up and reveals how his GF is now in Dehradun's St. Teresa which is the same college that he aspires to be, but currently, he is studying in a mediocre level college named Pishorilal Chamandas College in Mussoorie which has a weird couple who are the principal of it.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">And then, we are introduced to Shreya (Ananya) and her brother Manav (Aditya Seal). They are spoilt brats and their dad is a college trustee. Later, finally, Tiger gets admission into St. Teresa and cold war ensues between Rohan and the brother-sister duo of Shreya and Manav. Soon, a lot of drama, which includes cheating, fights and actors breaking into a jig at drop of hat unfolds till one of them emerges as the Student of the Year.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Speaking of the performances, lead star Tiger Shroff fares well, but he hardly looks like a college kid to me. On the other hand, Tara Sutaria who is marking their Bollywood debut with this movie has delivered an average performance. Talking about Ananya, another debutante was good in parts and will surely remind you of Alia Bhatt. YouTuber Harsh Beniwal plays the role of Tiger's sidekick; he manages to steal the show with his scenes which actually do induce snorts of laughter among the audience.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Talking about the setbacks, the movie will let you down by a predictable plot as some parts which could have been better were actually written shabbily. The abrupt ending and cliched treatment in many places spoils the movie. The film also falters when it comes to length as I felt it was quite lengthy with the last chunk of Kabaddi competition too was stretched unnecessarily.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">All in all, this tale of friendship and love lacks soul, but if you are looking for snacky and breezy entertainment and sucker of rom-coms then go and grab the tickets for this film this weekend. But if you do not like sports and expecting serious on-screen love then you can give it a miss.</span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/student-year-2-review-tiger-ananya-taras-film-packed-ott-theatrics-yawnworthy-twist-450193</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-450193</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 10:11:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Avengers: Endgame Review: This MCU film is the perfect swan song to the OG 6 Avengers]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/avengers-endgame-poster-square-crop.jpg"></img><p dir="auto" style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">When it comes to the performances, Robert Downey Jr. gives us his best performance in MCU history and as usual, is the captain of the ship.

The conflicted love story uses the crutches of the political unrest during the partition era as its plot to take us back in time where hate defeated love, where revenge was the only thing that mattered was to realise it was all for NOTHING, absolutely nothing. In the small town of Husnabad, near Lahore, two hearts full of anger and angst met, while another two were about to get separated. But one decision entangled their lives forever, for good or bad, no one can tell. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Zafar (Varun Dhawan) grew up in Hira Mandi, a Muslim dominated area where Behaar Begum (Madhuri Dixit) and her impeccable dancing and singing skills were the talk of the town. Growing up in a town where being a love child only invited taunts and more humiliation for him, Zafar's only motive is revenge. On the other hand, Satya (Sonakshi Sinha), the daughter-in-law of Balraj Chaudhary (Sanjay Dutt)'s family is suffering from a fatal disease. She asks her husband, Dev Chaudhary (Aditya Roy Kapur) to get settled again to make sure he isn't left alone after her. She begs Roop (Alia Bhatt) to be her saviour. The love Dev and Satya shared was eternal in its own way, but their actions made way for a fresh eternal love story to brew and how!</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Zafar, infamous for being a womaniser, is drawn to Behaar Begum's haveli for the first time in 20 years after hearing Roop's voice, which he says is filled with 'ishq' and 'dard.' The first scene shared by Zafar and Roop in Kalank has been shot wonderfully, with Zafar crossing the river for her, in the metaphoric sense. The two meet when Ravana is being burned down to ashes signifying their love will be the death of them. One must get the clue there! While Roop seeks love in Zafar, Zafar has other motives which are backed by strong hatred for his father and mother. But Roop's innocence and love force Zafar to change his outlook and give up his hatred. Her love consumed him in ways nothing else did. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The love story, however, is not that simple. Of course. Falling in love with another man whilst being married to someone else is not an easy road, is it? And a troubled and conflicted family feud only adds to the commotion. But what makes Zafar and Roop's love story eternal is their simplistic love, and ability to sacrifice and accept each other despite everything. Varun makes Zafar look convincing and has perhaps delivered one of the best performances in the movie. For me, his scenes with Madhuri stood out and his chemistry with Alia was without a doubt superlative. The only scene which literally was the major put off featuring Varun was where he is seen engaged in a bull fight. The special effects used for the particular scene made me reconsider Manikarnika's VFX, for a moment. Was it that bad? Yes!</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Alia, on the other hand, delivered a poor performance which could have been great. While her scenes with Varun were the highlight, long dialogue delivery made it look caricaturish. It seemed she was trying too hard to fit into the shoes of an aspiring classical singer. The dialogues though written in accordance to the partition era did not have any soul. It is ironical given that it is the writing and dialogues that majorly elevate a period drama. Even if we forget, how poorly the dialogues were written, the screenplay by Abhishek Varman did fall flat for me. It just did not work. Despite trying hard to feel invested in the characters, a sense of detachment prevailed every time as we were bombarded with heavy dialogues that not only lacked soul but were vomited like a mugged delivery. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">However, it is Kunal Kemmu, Sonakshi Sinha, Aditya Roy Kapur, Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit who actually elevated the entire film for me. Wish they had been given more screen space. Kunal as Abdul, leader of a Muslim League Party and a friend of Zafar, was too good. His confrontational scenes with Zafar and his rather sinister side is a revelation and how. Kunal surely nails it. On the other hand, Sonakshi as the quintessential bahu, who is deeply and madly in love with her partner, is top notch as well. Aditya does justice to Dev with his restrained performance, after a few hiccups in the beginning. Madhuri, as usual, was a dream to watch on-screen. There is absolutely no one who can beat her when it comes to dancing with perfect expressions. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The background score for the movie is one of the biggest highlights with the title track making you feel each emotion, but the flawed script disappoints. After all, only superlative performances and poor writing cannot elevate a movie, but a superlative script and average performance might still do the job. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Give Kalank a chance if you are a hopeless romantic, but enter without any expectations!</span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/kalank-movie-review-varun-dhawan-and-alia-bhatt-starrer-predictably-slow-paced-and-soulless-447077</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-447077</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 11:06:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Notebook Review: Salman Khan backed Zaheer Iqbal and Pranutan Bahl starrer is all about old school romance]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/notebook main.jpg"></img><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Love letters, personal diaries, are all a thing in history today. While we all love hearing endless love sagas, wish to experience old school romance, everyone is too busy pursuing their mundane life. Amid this millennial chaos, both professional and personal, Salman Khan presents an interesting love story set in Kashmir. The movie allows love to brew via text in a Notebook while highlighting several key issues, education being one of them. Notebook chronicles around Kabir Kaul (Zaheer Iqbal) who is tricked into teaching in a school started by his late father, where on a hand count 5 students were admitted. In an isolated school located right in the middle of a lake, Kabir stumbles upon a diary written by Firdaus (Pranutan Bahl), who previously taught in the same school. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">As Kabir struggled to make peace with the kids initially, it is her diary which propels him to make those kids his own. In lows and high, Firdaus unknowingly becomes the voice in his head which tugged at his heart in a way no one else did. Like a Romeo, Kabir considers her his soulmate till he finds out she has a fiance but that doesn't stop him from loving her. Following her statutory warning of "thanking the universe", Kabir innocently later even confessed of her becoming his universe. Incidentally, later he becomes the ray of sunshine in her life. How? Well, that is for you to explore but let us add that the twist is predictable, like any other Bollywood movie. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">However, director Nitin Kakkar has managed to add life to an otherwise ordinary script with the help of some beautiful picturesque landscape. However, the music of the movie falls flat. Though it might go with the rhythm of the story, the album doesn't have a single stand-alone hit. Also, the Bumbro track is a stark reminder of Hrithik Roshan and Preity Zinta starrer Mission Kashmir's track by the same name. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Coming to Zaheer and Pranutan, both debutantes manage to surprise with their relatively honest performance. It took Zaheer a few scenes to make me invest in Kabir but once done, his innocence and earnest performance made him likable. Pranutan, daughter of Mohnish Bahl and granddaughter of legendary actress Nutan, too makes you root for Firdaus and her relationship with the kids but the best moments in the movie are with kids who add life to every scene they are a part of. Apart from bringing back the old school romance, which you perhaps read in books, the movie also switches plot from highlight the issue of Kashmiri students being deprived of education and moving to violence.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Very subtly, Notebook tries to show the plight of Kashmiris and the kids there who are made to confront the harsh realities of the region. But in the end, love triumphs everything. Though we appreciate the subtle message, the mention of Kashmiri Pandits and history of Kabir's parents felt forced and unnecessary. Given the social age we live in, such love stories are hard to resonate with but nonetheless, for those who believe in destined love stories, Notebook might work for you! </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Statutory Warning: Go without any expectations and you will be left surprised. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/notebook-movie-review-salman-khan-backed-zaheer-iqbal-and-pranutan-bahl-starrer-all-about-old-school-roman</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-444713</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:50:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Junglee Movie Review: Chuck Russell's Bollywood directorial debut with Vidyut Jammwal falls flat]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Junglee Movie Review Chuck Russell's Bollywood directorial debut with Vidyut Jammwal falls flat (2).jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Chuck Russell who gave a cult movie like The Mask seemed less ambitious and quite satisfied with screenplay and story of Junglee. So, if you are thinking you may get a Hollywood movie's feel, then you are wrong. Junglee is a story about a Raj Nair who is a vet by profession. He visits his father’s elephant reserve after 10 years and reunites with his childhood friends including Bhola, the elephant. After reaching Chandrika elephant sanctuary, he comes to know about the international </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">poachers</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> racket and fights them to save his elephants.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The major setback of this action drama is the clichéd treatment by the director. Talking about the plot, the writers didn't try their best to weave a narrative to make the same interesting. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Coming to the performances, Vidyut Jammwal as new age Tarzan failed to lift the movie. I was expecting a lot from Vidyut, but he disappointed at many levels including how his character was mostly disconnected with other characters.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The movie features seasoned artists like Atul Kulkarni and Makrand Deshpande, but their acting chops went in vain. Their acting was below par in the movie and couldn't cover the movie's flaws. Talking about Atul Kulkarni as a villain who can do cold-blooded murders, he was not at all convincing. I think, he should hardly play a baddie in future. On the other hand, Makrand's scenes were few and his character was also written lazily. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Newbie Pooja Sawant impressed us with her acting skills, but Asha Bhat as a journalist who keeps recording everything was too fictitious and seemed like a forced addition in the movie.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The only saving grace </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">were</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> Vidyut's impeccable action scenes. The stunt choreography was executed perfectly. The film did well to call out the poachers and crooks who kill elephants in order to get tusks to make ivory products, but in terms of entertainment, it failed to deliver a great action drama. So, if you are Vidyut's fan or an action or animal lover then yes you can enjoy this movie over the weekend.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/junglee-full-movie-review-chuck-russells-bollywood-directorial-debut-vidyut-jamwal-dry-pretty-444686</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-444686</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2019 11:19:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Junglee Mid Movie Review: Vidyut Jammwal starrer fails to deliver an action packed entertainer]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Junglee-Poster_0.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Talking about performances, I was expecting more from Vidyut, but he fails to deliver.

Batra establishes a world which is melancholic, sad and filled with bottled up emotions in Photograph in a rich-girl-poor-boy setup. Both, Rafi [Siddiqui] and Miloni [Shah], played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Sanya Malhotra respectively, despite their apparent class different are unhappy people, looking for an escapade from their mundane life. Though the duo meet in what can be called an unusual setup, Rafi and Miloni end up finding a lot of similarities between them. To start with, their fondness with childhood memories, their silence and quiet demeanour. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Rafi, a road side photographer who runs his business near the famous Gateway of India, a place where both the worlds, the rich and the poor collide. Rafi promises to capture a precious moment to each of his potential customer by telling them that the "Chehre ki Dhoop (light on their faces)" and the "wind in their hair" wouldn't be the same as today. Miloni, a timid Gujarati girl who has been brought up to follow the path shown by parents, a class topper, who literally doesn't speak until very necessary, a Chartered Accountant student, visits Gateway with her family on an impromptu trip. In what can be called destiny, she ends up getting her first picture clicked by him, her first individual decision, only to leave while it was still getting processed. Rafi uses her photo to get his hands off her ailing grandmother who has been behind him to get married. Noori, he names her. An extension of his inner desires, burdened by the barriers, Rafi shows the vulnerability of a poor man who can't rest in peace in a city like Mumbai. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Call it a wishful thinking but Miloni, who is mentioned to be an aspiring actress in her childhood, founds a way to live her dream, perhaps for a short period by playing Noori, Rafi's fiancé on his request. She mentions while in a chat with her prospect groom that she aspires to stay in a village. Laugh as much as you may but that is her escapade, her silent rebel against the far thrusted wishes of her parents. On the other hand, Rafi is reminded time and again in different ways, be it his friends, his grandmother or the cab driver, of Miloni being out of his league, not just because of the exterior appearance but an indirect reference to the class, religion and other socio-economic barriers. </span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Batra's story is very roughly written and ambiguous leading to almost no where but what makes it watchable is Sanya's performance. Malhotra with her quiet expression and blinks and nervous clicking made sure to make us feel her vulnerability and emotions, making way for an emotional connection with her character. Nawaz, on the other hand, beautifully compliments her with his silent gaze and hopeful eyes. While we continued to guess if what the duo shares might translate into love, Batra surprised us with the climax scene. Some stories are not meant to go anywhere. Truly.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Though we hoped the movie was edited a bit tighter and could have been better paced. The slow pace to it made it a tiring affair by the end of it. Batra's Photograph is no Lunchbox but if you love melancholic movies, go and watch Photograph. </span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/photograph-review-nawazuddin-siddiqui-and-sanya-malhotra-starrer-slow-paced-ambiguous-and-melancholic-443171</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-443171</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:34:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Badla Movie Review: Amitabh Bachchan, Taapsee Pannu flirt with truth in this thriller {3.5/5}]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Badla trailer main_1.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Badla Movie: Badla</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Badla Movie Cast: Amitabh Bachchan, Taapsee Pannu, Amrita Singh</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Badla Movie Director: Sujoy Ghosh</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Badla Movie Ratings: 3.5/5</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">"Concentrate on the details", reiterates Amitabh Bachchan aka lawyer Badal Gupta in the Sujoy Ghosh thriller Badla umpteen times. And that's exactly what is needed to be done to figure out the plot of Badla, which changes pace after every 15 minutes. The movie, which is an official adaptation of the 2017 Spanish film The Invisible Guest, sells a web of lies in the first half, while the second half is a </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">fast-paced</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> recap of the murder. But only this time, the </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">unraveling</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> is much more fun, leaving each one of us waiting with bated breath to figure who is playing whom! </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Badla is essentially a story of the businesswoman named Naina Sethi played by Taapsee, who is being prosecuted for an alleged murder of her lover Arjun, whose murder is again connected to another murder of a teenager whose mother Rani Kaur played by Amrita Singh is on the hunt for justice. Now, are these two murders interlinked? If yes, how? If no, is Naina really guilty or so as she pleads? Badal Gupta, played by Big B, is the ONLY ray of hope for Naina with a record of winning all the cases in his career. In the very beginning, Badal quips that he is Dhritarashtra, the blind king, a metaphor to the justice system. He through smart wordplay and interrogation tactics tries very hard to break Naina, but she is not someone who can be played easily. "I am Businesswoman for a reason," she exclaims during one of the scenes. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">What keeps the storytelling engaging is this tit for tat game between the accused and the lawyer which keeps up with the tempo of the screenplay. The layered </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">humour</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> crack us up in between, but before we dwell too much into laughter, Sujoy doesn't let us dwindle from the main plot. The screenplay is tight and like expected the climax will leave you shocked. But, if you have already watched the original Spanish movie, the climax is unlikely to shock you as Sujoy has not played around much with it, which we wish he had. This is perhaps one of the lesser drawbacks to the movie. The music is kept intense to match the intensity of the murder mystery and thank god that none of the characters broke into a dance sequence. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Now, finally, let us admit that it is a sheer joy to watch Amitabh Bachchan and Taapsee Pannu sit across the table playing with each other the ultimate game of truth and deceit. Sujoy Ghosh has adapted the screenplay very beautifully adding a little magic of his own. The dialogues are kept contemporary, dropping several hints for those who were equally invested to decode the murder mystery. "A lie told for a bigger cause, is not a lie," preached Mahabharata and it is no coincidence that Sujoy decided to plug in several references to the mythological epic. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Amrita Singh as Rani Kaur is wonderful. Her strength and vulnerability as a mother come across very well. Big B and Taapsee get the best of dialogues and two make sure to elevate it with their strong performance and terrific screen presence. Taapsee portrays vulnerability, guilt, power </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">and</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> class impeccably, not leaving an ounce of </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">loophole</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> there, even though we wished Naina was as good with observing details as she was with her words. The flamboyance with which Big B makes an entry is a sign of his undying energy and legacy with his baritone voice adding a mystery to his character. He looks like a man with motive but what? Go find out yourself by watching Badla!</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/badla-movie-review-amitabh-bachchan-taapsee-pannu-flirt-truth-gripping-thriller-sujoy-ghosh-442590</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-442590</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 08:29:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Captain Marvel Review: A wondrous spectacle rightly powered by Brie Larson’s performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Captain Marvel (1)_1.jpg"></img><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Superhero universe is mostly crowded by men and that’s why it is super refreshing to see Marvel’s first female-led standalone movie. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Starring Brie Larson as the titular ‘hero’, the  Marvel Cinematic Universe officially introduces Carol Danvers with this movie. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Set in 1995, the Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck directed film tells the story of Carol Danvers and her journey to becoming Captain Marvel, after the earth gets caught between two alien worlds' fight. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Talking about Brie and her performance, those who had doubts on Larson’s ability to embody the role, this film certainly erases them all. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Brie's performance is 'marvel' lous. It’s her first step in the MCU and I have to say she is here to stay. She rightly brings the strength and the emotional vulnerability aspects that this particular character required.</span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">I think she ideally imbibed the character with integrity and compassion, and she looks stellar in the iconic Captain Marvel suit. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"> Speaking of her camaraderie with none other than Samuel L Jackson, without a ounce of doubt, the same is what elevates the film many notches higher. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">If Brie and Jackson are heart and soul of the film, she’s perfectly aided by a strong supporting cast.</span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Lashana Lynch who plays Danvers' friend and fellow Air Force pilot in the film will impress you with her impeccable acting chops. Also, makers get A+ in casting Ben Mendelsohn as Talos. They deserve the most credit among the supporting cast.</span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Talking about another incredible supporting cast member, Goose, Danvers’ cat, she undoubtedly stole the show and cat lovers will rejoice the most. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Coming to the story, the weaving is done apltly enough to be engaging and fun. 90s nostalgia is there but without overdoing it. Also, the stunt choreography and the vfx is one of the finest that I’ve witnessed till now. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The movie makers deserve an applause for the distinctive stance on feminism as it doesn’t resort to male bashing or faux feminism to get its point across.</span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The major takeaway from Captain Marvel movie is Stan Lee signature cameo in the film. The same will make you super emotional. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">And finally, the post credit scene without which no Marvel movie is complete is a major surprise and will make all MCU fans hop in joy. I cannot reveal it but I can just say it received a huge round of applause, shrill cries and hooting from the audience. </span></div><div dir="auto" style="font-sizex: 1rem;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">In a nutshell, it is a lot of fun with alot of action and drama. I have to say Captain Marvel is not just a great origin story but also an ideal Avengers prequel. If she is pitched to be future of MCU, then she is the bright beacon of hope.</span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/captain-marvel-review-wondrous-spectacle-rightly-powered-brie-larson-s-performance-442321</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-442321</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2019 17:12:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luka Chuppi Review: Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon’s live in drama hits up well with clever humour]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/KartikAaryan-KritiSanon-LukaChuppi-Posters (1).jpg"></img><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Live-in relationship is “marriage without license” or a choice to understand each other better? Luka Chuppi tries to encapsulate these questions whilst offering a contemporary story through the prism of Guddu (Kartik Aaryan) and Rashmi (Kriti Sanon) who are journalists who fall in love. Belonging to Brahmin families, the duo stumbles upon the concept of live-in while covering a local news broadcast. While Guddu, the youngest in family, is caught in family drama over marriage, Rashmi is a modern, outspoken woman who isn’t yet ready for a commitment like marriage, thereby forcing Guddu to give in to her demand of exploring each other via a “live-in relationship.” But their quest to break free isn’t as smooth as we may think! What follows later is a rollercoaster ride with Guddu’s uncle (played by Pankaj Tripathi) as the annoying (read as raunchy) character. </span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The biggest strength of the movie is its concept of live-in which resonates with every millennial. Yes, thankfully Luka Chuppi is not a totally brainless comedy, but in fact, a cleverly made one. Picking up instances from day to day life, without making a political statement on face, the movie manages to hit the right chords. For instance, with Sajan Ghar Main Chali (Hum Aapke Hain Kaun) playing in the background, Guddu (Kartik) is seen bidding farewell to his family (just like brides post wedding) as he heads to explore the world of “live-in” relationship. The scene evokes a lot of laughter without making it cringing whilst making a stand-alone statement, which worked for me. </span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">In another scene, Guddu’s mother is seen embracing the idea of her son becoming a house husband, while her daughter-in-law goes to work. But, but, but, Guddu’s disgruntled ‘bhabhi’s’ silent protest highlights the hypocrisy of the statement of the society in broader terms. While the story is the main highlight, it lacks originality when it comes to songs and often succumbs to cater to the conventional cinema-goers. In an attempt to straddle well between being modern yet not be “too progressive,” writer Rohan Shankar appears to have stretched the movie and looks confused which reflects in the storyline. </span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Kartik in his full form makes Guddu likeable. He adds a different kind of innocence to Guddu, but we wish to see him experiment with his roles more in his career. Kriti does justice as Rashmi, but it is Aparshakti Khurrana who yet again proves why he is a power-packed performer (remember his note-worthy performance in Stree). His punch lines and comic timing really set the mood of the movie with Pankaj Tripathi doing what he does best. But, we still can't wrap our head around why he would take up such a role post giving such a stellar performances?</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Director Laxman Utekar has done a fair job along with the dialogue writer who delivers some rib tickling humourous dialogues, which are mild but noteworrthy.</span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The movie will NOT make you go wow but if you are looking for some relaxing time and mild laughter to cease the ‘borderline’ tension, Kartik and Kriti have the right offering for you.</span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/luka-chuppi-review-kartik-aaryan-and-kriti-sanon-s-live-drama-hits-well-clever-humour-441824</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-441824</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 19:03:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sonchiriya Review: Sushant Singh Rajput and Bhumi Pednekar’s unconventional ‘dacoit’ film is NOT for everyone]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/sonchiriya review poster_0.jpg"></img><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Abhishek’s attempt at giving each character a story and backdrop is commendable making them more humane than ever. Cinematographer Anuj Rakesh Dhawan captured the ravines very aesthetically. However, it is the performances which stand out. Though you might feel fatigue within an hour, if patient, the movie strikes a chord with you by the end of it, leaving you with lingering memories of the dacoits and the real ones. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Let’s also take a moment to appreciate the action sequences which were directed pretty well, without making them difficult to stomach. Manoj Bajpayee in the small cameo proves why he is one of the best actors of the industry. The flare and precision with which he plays the character of Maan Singh is amazing. Sushant delivers a superlative performance as Lakhan by literally wearing it as his second skin. The restrain the actor manages to show in this tale of aggression is superlative. On the other hand, Shorey stands out as Vakil Singh. The maturity, impulsiveness and despair that he showcases as Vakil is noteworthy. We surely need to see him more on-screen.</span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Using ‘Son Chiriya’ as a metaphor to caste politics and lives of bandits, Abhishek Chaubey serves an uncoventional yet engaging dish, but not everyone would like the taste of it. </span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/son-chiriya-review-sushant-singh-rajput-and-bhumi-pednekar-s-unconventional-daciot-film-not-everyone-441804</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-441804</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 15:23:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Total Dhamaal Movie Review: Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor &amp; Madhuri Dixit starrer is ironically short on laughs]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/total 1_0.jpg"></img><div style="outline: 0px; font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px;"><em style="outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;">Total Dhamaal</span></span></em></div><div style="outline: 0px; font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px;"><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px; outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;">Total Dhamaal</span></span></em><em style="outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;"> Director: Indra Kumar</span></span></em></div><div style="outline: 0px; font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px;"><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px; outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;">Total Dhamaal</span></span></em><em style="outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;"> Cast: </span></span></em><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Ajay Devgn, Madhuri Dixit, Anil Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Javed Jaffrey</span></div><div style="outline: 0px; font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px;"><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: noto_sansregular; font-sizex: 18px; outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;">Total Dhamaal</span></span></em><em style="outline: 0px;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-sizex: 16px; line-height: 32px !important;"><span style="outline: 0px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 32px !important; font-sizex: 18px !important;"> Movie Stars: 2/5</span></span></em></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The makers of the third installment of the Dhamaal series starring Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Riteish Deshmukh, Arshad Warsi, Javed Jaffrey, Mahesh Manjrekar and Johnny Lever among others have played safe by rolling out the same concept that we have already seen in Dhamaal and Double Dhamaal with obvious flaws in the writing and the jokes which are limp. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The film opens with a grand title song that introduces the cast, and soon enough, they all bump into each other and work towards a common goal that is to find the hidden booty in a very weird plot. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While </span></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">everyone</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> is in pairs, one pair that stole the show is that of Javed Jaffery and Arshad Warsi. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Their impeccable camaraderie was impressive. I think they undoubtedly got the </span></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">best-written</span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"> roles. Another impressive pair was that of Riteish Deshmukh and his partner as they were rightly hitting the comic notes. Also, his scenes with none </span><span style="font-sizex:16px;">other famous comedian</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> Johnny Lever were beyond hilarious. I wish makers had added more scenes of the veteran comic. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Talking about the most vital but poorly performed pair, Ajay Devgn's and Sanjay Mishra's performance was limited because of their poorly written characters. Sanjay Mishra constantly refering to Ajay as "bro" will annoy you the most. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The film's bright spot was 90's popular jodi of Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit. The bickering couple, who are in the middle of their divorce, make the audiences chuckle a bit. But again, their great acting chops and crackling chemistry went in vain in this brainless comedy.</span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While the first half is still digestible and slightly funny, the second half is super boring, predictable and has </span></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">weak</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">storyline</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> coupled with shoddy CGI. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Speaking of the moments that one can take home are where Jaaved Jaaferi and Arshad Warsi were trying hard to be good employees at the art gallery.

Free from what? That forms the nucleus of Shelly Chopra Dhar's directorial debut. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga commences like a typical love story with a wedding sequence and a Punjabi family trying to set up their daughter with an honourable man. Sweety (Sonam Kapoor) is a naive and inncoent woman with a secret eating her away day by day under the societal pressure which includes her very own brother. She has a conservative yet caring father in the Moga ka Mukesh Ambani Balbir Chaudhary. Then, we have Sahil Rizwan (Rajkummar Rao), a struggling dramatist who is trying to find inspiration. The siyappa arises when a chance encounter between Sweety and Rizwan makes the Chaudhary family believe that the two are in love with each other. However, it's Sweety's secret that changes the entire course of the movie.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Based on P. G. Wodehouse's A Damsel in Distress, Shelly Chopra Dhar tries to bring light to a subject that hasn't been tackled with honesty in Bollywood. We come to know towards the interval that Sweety is in love with a woman. What works for Ek Ladki is the subtlety with which Shelly has brought forward a thought-provoking story. The fact that it's set in a small-town town Moga, in Punjab, the reactions, the emotions are realistic. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In what could be considered as Sonam's finest work to date, it might surprise you that she had the least dialogues. Shelly worked brilliantly with Sonam and let her emotions do all the talking instead. However, there were certain poignant scenes which could have had more momentum but you don't feel any empathy towards Sweety. There are a few dampening moments, but Sonam picks up in the second half especially during the scenes where she is enacting in a play. Anil Kapoor is the true heart of the movie and he steals the show with his effervescent performance. His scenes with Sonam are heartwarming and his chemistry with Juhi Chawla will bring a huge smile to your face. Leave it to Chawla as Chatro to make even overreacting seem genuine and endearing. Rajkummar Rao as Rizwan breathes life and plays the interweaving mind that brings everything together.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When it comes to the storyline, it wasn't flawless and had minor glitches, especially in the first half. It's the second half where the ball starts rolling. I wasn't the biggest fan of the editing which seems extremely haphazard at times. The soundtrack just had four songs which added the right flavour.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/akshay-kumar-has-one-word-sonam-kapoor-anil-kapoor-rajkummar-raos-film-ek-ladki-ko-dekha-toh-aisa-laga-439054">Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga</a> worth watching? While it did not shatter the glass box, it definitely left a dent. As Sahil proclaims to a packed theatre crowd to see his play from the heart and not the mind, I would say watch Ek Ladki with both your heart and mind and you'll be left with a broader mindset as that is something which India truly requires.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/ek-ladki-ko-dekha-toh-aisa-laga-review-film-will-leave-you-broader-mindset-which-india-truly-needs-439097</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-439097</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 08:48:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Manikarnika Review: Kangana Ranaut’s ‘mardani’ act makes up for a poor screenplay; Ankita Lokhande impresses]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Manikarnika Review Kangana Ranauts mardani act makes up for a poor screenplay Ankita Lokhande impresses.jpg"></img><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Vijayendra has taken different chapters from Manikarnika’s life but loses the plot midway.

Rawal as always has justified his part while Yami who played the Intelligence officer has very little to do. Kirti Kulhari plays the Indian Air Force officer, Seemat Kaur, who plays a key role in the entire operation but the whole sequence of choosing the best team for the purpose somehow doesn't connect and seems to be driven more by emotions than logic. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Coming to the second half, Vicky elevates and how during the last 20-25 minutes. These last few minutes sees a lot of movement from the Government, Intelligence as well as the level of execution by the team led by Vivaan (Vicky). Those sequences finally managed to evoke some patriotic feelings within me. The cinematography is raw and top notch during the last few scenes. The footwork of the jawans are shot well and makes you sit on the edge for what's to come. However, the screenplay has been a major drawback, it doesn't hold you in its entirety and has its highs and lows. Director Aditya Dhar should have probably invested a little more time studying the body language and technicalities of the military operations given that the movie essentially is based on Indian Army. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The 2016 Surgical Strike has been a big accomplishment for the Indian Government; The Surgical strike has been controversial and politicised too with the leader of the opposition Mr Rahul Gandhi even questioning the Indian Army and the whole basis of the operation; The Surgical Strike has been one of the most talked about events between Indian and Pakistan in recent times by not only the Indian Media but also the International news media; The Surgical Strike has been wrapped under classified files for 2 years with no details revealed to the Indian citizens.

The dialogues are kept colloquial and the dialect has been kept in mind considering the movie is set in a small town. However, I did feel that the romance and later misunderstanding between Nakul and Renee was unnecessary and could have been avoided. Special mention to Surekha Sikri who is a riot to watch. Her situational comedy is on point and we wish to see her more on the big screens. </span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#000000;">Ayushmann portrays the various layers in Nakul  flamboyantly. He is here for a hatrick and we only want to see him more and more. On the other hand, Sanya had very little to do in the movie except for being the love interest. Except for the scene where she indulges Nakul to think of this situation with an open mind, there is hardly any layers to Renee. On the other hand, Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao are the real stars, the heroes of the movie. </span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#000000;">Badhaai Ho manages to ruffle many emotions in us while keeping it engaging and progressive.

One takes place in the first half after India achieves Independence from British Raj. However, this freedom came at the cost of the Hindu vs Muslim struggle, which continues to this day. As a bereaved Shyam threatens to kill Muslims if they come near him, Manto asks whether he would kill him too since he was a Muslim himself. Shyam's reply was enough for Manto to leave his beloved city of Bombay and shift base to Pakistan, something he was completely against. Cut to, a few years later when Shyam comes to visit a deteriorating shell of a man in Manto and you see the unbecoming of a brilliant artist, too ahead of his time.</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><em>Manto</em> is an ode by Nandita Das to a misunderstood intellectual who was above his contemporaries and gave us stories that defied the lines of reality and fiction. He believed in becoming the voice of the voiceless, specifically for women. He wrote about prostitutes and topics that were deemed as 'Obscene' but the underlying essence of his stories was understood a little too late. Manto was a man more concerned about his literature being defamed as being sub-standard than the hearing of his court case, which could have led to months of imprisonment.</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">The biopic delves into the life and times of Pakistani writer Saadat Hasan Manto from his flourishing days in the heartland of India, Bombay to his downward spiral in his remaining days in a newly formed Pakistan, specifically Lahore. You see Manto as the uninhibited personality who used the freedom of expression to the fullest but was always questioned for his motives. Before an Independent India, Manto's writings were celebrated. However, when he was forced to shift his home base to Pakistan, his literature was touted as 'sensationalism'. </span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Nandita Das has done a spectacular job in breathing life to Manto's words on-screen with a special mention to one of his notable and celebrated works, <em>Thanda Gosht</em> (<em>Cold Meat</em>). Manto's crisp storytelling was given an earnest tribute with a special appearance by Divya Dutta and Ranvir Shorey. Nandita has skillfully used Manto's sharpest tool, his writings to tell his story. However, much of the focus was on the controversies that were a part and parcel of Manto's life. Not too much focus was given to the psyche and the mind palace of what made Manto the man that he was, unique from the rest of his counterparts.</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">There aren't enough words in the English dictionary to explain what an exemplary performer Mr Nawazuddin Siddiqui is. His minimalistic and restrained performance is so heart-wrenching to watch. Nawaz has managed to capture the essence of the inner turmoil Manto had to face with ending his beautiful love affair with the city of Bombay, where his ammi, his abbu and his firstborn were buried. The sheer look of distraught when he had to bid adieu to Bombay showed the shift in Manto's outlook towards life and his slump to alcoholism, hallucinations and writer's block. It was tragically beautiful to watch.</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Manto's wife Safia (Rasika Dugal) was his biggest support system yet his strongest critic as well. Rasika earnestly immerses into the innocence of Safia and gives us a supporting character that was just as important as Manto himself. A special mention to Tahir Raj Bhasin as Shyam and Rajshri Deshpande as Ismat Chutgai, two strong characters that were the metaphor in Manto's life for India. Manto's friendship with Ismat was beautifully woven into the story.</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Rita Ghosh's production design and Kartik Vijay's cinematography brings intricate realism to how India was pre-Independence and how Pakistan was post-Independence. </span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">A gut-wrenching scene in <em>Manto</em> features Manto's <em>Toba Tek Singh</em>, which is like a mini-autobiography of the writer himself. The constant battle of being a Pakistani with his heart in India. That is what Manto represented. In his own words, "It is also possible, that Saadat Hasan dies, but Manto remains alive."</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">Saadat Hasan Manto deserved his own story and that was what we got with Nandita Das' <em>Manto</em> through Nawazuddin's eyes. Bollywood, you can take your Sanjay Dutt's and we're happy with Manto.</span></span></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-sizex: small;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-sizex:16px;">We rate it a 70% on the movie meter. </span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/manto-movie-review-nawazuddin-siddiqui-acting-what-saadat-hasan-manto-literature-426471</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-426471</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2018 12:54:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mitron Movie Review: Jaccky Bhagnani is like the extra salt that ruins a dish entirely ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Mitron Movie Review Jaccky Bhagnani is like the extra salt that ruins a dish entirely.jpg"></img><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#000000;">In Mitron, Jaccky Bhagnani has attempted to give acting his best shot yet again but his monotone expressions and dialogue delivery ruin the momentum of any and every scene.

However, Love Sonia is not that stereotypical. A memorable scene in the second half is between Selma (Demi Moore) and Sonia as the latter narrates her tale of struggles. In spite of the downhill battle and struggles she has had to endure at such a tender age, the protagonist finds 'hope'. And in the process, the young girl becomes an adult.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">In conclusion, Love Sonia is hard to watch for the brutal honesty that many social message dramas fail to accomplish but it deserves to be watched.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Love, Pinkvilla.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We rate it a 70% on the movie meter.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/love-sonia-movie-review-mrunal-thakur-and-freida-pintos-film-gives-subtle-voice-brutally-voiceless-425506</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-425506</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Sep 2018 15:35:38 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se Movie Review: Not even Dharmendra's old-world charm can save this nonsensical film]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se movie review.JPG"></img><p style=" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl2bE53hh5H/?utm_source=ig_embed" style=" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-sizex:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;" target="_blank">Ab hogi party behisab, chal pade hai teen nawab! #YamlaPaglaDeewanaPhirSe ke sath.</a></p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The writing is sloppy, cringe-worthy and downright outrageous.

With many patriotic movies, Pakistan is shown in a bad light but in Gold, to see the camaraderie between Indians and Pakistanis is a delight to witness on the big screen.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The writing is so crisp that you can even forgive the poor VFX of the stadium crowds and the music adds the right flavours and moves the narrative forward. </span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Gold is a patriotic sports movie done right and is a near classic that deserves to be watched on Independence Day.</span></span></div><div><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We rate it a 75% on the movie meter.</span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/gold-movie-review-akshay-kumar-instils-closeted-patriot-us-and-shines-near-classic-sports-film-423160</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-423160</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2018 10:51:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Karwaan Movie Review: Irrfan Khan, Dulquer and Mithila are the 3 Musketeers in this vagabond road trip]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-09/Irrfan Khan's 'Karwaan' to release on August 10_0_0.jpg"></img><p><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">"Main akela hi </span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">chala</span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> tha </span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">janab</span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">-e-manzil </span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">magar</span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, Log </span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">judte</span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> gaye aur </span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">karwaan</span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span></em><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">banta</span></span></em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em> gaya,"</em> is written on the blue van owned by the quirky Shaukat (Irrfan Khan) and that sums up the journey of <em>Karwaan </em>for you. </span></span></p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Director Akarsh Khurana spearheads this travelogue of </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">self-discovery</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> and letting go of your daddy issues.

All three have been explored in <em>Karwaan</em>. Every South Indian will be delighted with the way the cities have been depicted as </span><span style="font-sizex:16px;">we are</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> taken on a wanderlust journey from Bangalore to Cochin. Kudos to Avinash Arun, for making the moviegoers familiar with the bylanes of South India.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>Karwaan </em>is about Avinash (Dulquer Salmaan) who gets news of his dad's demise and takes the help of Shaukat to get his father's body. The twist arises early when they come to know that his dad's body was misplaced with Tanya's (Mithila Palkar) grandmother's body. The Three </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Musketeers</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> travel to Cochin and encounter hurdles and needed fillers to understand the</span></span> <span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">eccentricities of each character and why they are the way they are. The plot is extremely simple and stretched over a span of two hours. With the help of Irrfan's insanely hilarious style of delivering dialogue, Dulquer and Mithila's effortless screen presence, well-timed music that makes sense with the situations, made up for the lack of a tight plot.</span></span></p><p><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Irrfan Khan proves yet again why he is the Khan like no other Khan in Bollywood. The only one who can make the simplest of characters a fan favourite. The audience impatiently waits for him to appear in each scene and his </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">one-liners</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> like, <em>"Roti hui </em></span></span><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>aurat</em></span></span><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> and </span></span></em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>doodhwale</em></span></span><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> par </span></span></em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>kabhi</em></span></span><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> </span></span></em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>bharosa</em></span></span><em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> nahin karna </span></span></em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><em>chahiye</em>,"</span></span></em><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> are the cherry on the cake. If Irrfan is yang then Dulquer is the Yin and his subtle performance is like a breath of fresh air. <em>Karwaan </em>was the apt Bollywood kick start that Dulquer deserved and they have used his likeability factor to the same extent as it was done with Fawad Khan in Khoobsurat. Mithila Palkar uses her bubbling burst of energy to add feminity and young naivety on what would have otherwise been an all-boys club.

But this film has more significance in a dud-ly year that we’ve gone through. So watch this one in the right ambience, where Bhai fans are whistling at the screens and throwing money in scenes. There are fewer songs to dance on though but Tiger Zinda Hai makes up for everything that’s gone wrong at the movies this year. No, it’s not a wonderfully carved script or the best movie ever made but this is one movie that will bring the audiences back to the theatres, something that’s no longer a thing one can take for granted. Not even the superstars.</span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">So we take on from Tiger and Zoya’s last stint in 2012. A bunch of Indian and Pakistani nurses </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">are</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> trapped in Iraq, a suicide mission for starters but these two extraordinary spies are given the task of rescuing them. There’s so much to admire in how Ali Abbas Zafar alters the real-life narrative on which the film is based. He blends in a jingoistic vein in the right measures as he goes on to make crucial observations about world peace and terrorism taking over at large. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">It’s exquisitely shot with thumping action sequences that could be visuals straight from a Hollywood actioner. Salman is </span></span><span id="m_1701187089210044794gmail-102"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">in</span></span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> a million bucks more as he growls and pummels people. It’s done with precision and slickness though it’s everything that Bhai fans seek, it’s not unbelievable action. There is a fantastic scene where he fights a pack of wolves. Once the plot moves to Make believe Syria (shot in Abu Dhabi), the political plotlines breathe heavy on the film. It’s interesting how Ali recreates havoc stricken Iraq. There are blatant references to multiple American movies but for Indian screens, it’s all too novel. Ali steers clear of IMG major political statements, probably his inadequacy but what he does beautifully </span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">is make</span></span><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> a nail-biting entertainer. We all know how this is going to pan out but Ali knows how to surprise still. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">While we celebrate Salman, a lot of the brilliant moments here come from Katrina. She is bombastic, matching his energy, prowess for action and yet peppering it with an inherent chemistry with Salman. A thoroughly thrilling scene had her rescue women, all blazing guns. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Salman, however, is himself every bit glorious. He is eons better than last time and maturity has only done both performers well. Iranian actor Sajjad Delfrooz is fabulous. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The beauty of the film is that Ali creates a magnum opus and yet he connects with an essentially human chord inside us. His film is a visual extravaganza and his characters are real. There is an ache in their eyes and the supporting cast is infallible. Angad Bedi, Paresh Rawal, Kumud Mishra are brilliant. It is truly the triumph of storytelling that the film despite being so plot-heavy and action heavy and character heavy, stretching to almost 2 hours 45 minutes never lets you lose interest. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We have seen a bunch of bad films, some horrible ones and a lot of unsatisfactory ones but Salman and Katrina give you a bonanza worth bang for the buck. </span></span></div><div dir="auto"><span style="font-sizex:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">We rate it 75% of the Pinkvilla Movie Meter. </span></span></div>]]></description><link>https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/tiger-zinda-hai-movie-review-salman-and-katrina-make-every-bad-film-mind-blowing-actioner-394119</link><guid  isPermaLink="false">pinkvilla-394119</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 07:49:30 +0000</pubDate></item><atom:link href="https://englishapi.pinkvilla.com" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" /></channel></rss>
