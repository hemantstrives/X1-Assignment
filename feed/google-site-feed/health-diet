<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Makhana (foxnuts) instead of chips:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Anshula loves indulging in makhanas and shared in the video that she roasts the superfood using different flavors at home. She even uses it for chaat and describes the food as absolutely &ldquo;yum.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Bajra or jowar chapati instead of whole wheat chapati:&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For a gluten-free meal, Anshula prefers bajra or jowar rotis instead of whole wheat chapatis. In the video, she stated that once you make the switch, you&rsquo;ll feel the &ldquo;difference.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Unsweetened Greek yogurt instead of regular curd:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Anshula loves consuming unsweetened Greek yogurt and calls it a great &ldquo;protein snack&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Sorghum or amaranth bread instead of regular bread:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The 34-year-old Internet celebrity ditches regular bread and instead consumes sorghum or amaranth bread for breakfast. This is a great gluten-free option for her to kick-start her day.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Liquid I.V. instead of packaged soda:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever she has the urge to drink something flavored, she opts for liquid I.V. &mdash; she stated in the post that she loves it because it &ldquo;hydrates and comes in so many flavors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Making these small changes helps Anshula stay healthy and fit, and manage symptoms of PCOS effectively. She encourages women dealing with PCOS to not &ldquo;sacrifice taste to eat better.&rdquo; In the post, she encouraged the &ldquo;PCOS girlies&rdquo; to try these swaps and see the difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PCOS brings about a lot of change in a woman&rsquo;s body &mdash; navigating through the complexities of the health issue is a transformational journey altogether. Anshula Kapoor has always been bold and courageous enough to talk about health issues in public &mdash; one can take cues from her food swaps and make changes to one&rsquo;s diet. However, it is always recommended to consult a medical practitioner before making any changes to your diet and lifestyle &mdash; especially when dealing with PCOS.&nbsp;</p>

Stefani works out at least four times a week, for 60-75 minutes per session. After all, a combination of nutrition and physical activity is the most promising when it comes to promoting healthy lifestyles and one&rsquo;s well-being (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10255595/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>). She visits the gym to stay fit and keep her abs toned. In an interview, the singer revealed that she always feels better when following a routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her former personal trainer, Mike Heatlie also mentioned that circuit training and high-intensity weight training with cardiovascular training is how she maintained her coveted physique.</p>

<p>Along with her husband, Blake, Gwen also carries out her exercises and plays tennis. They go to the gym together and she does squats, lunges, and light weights. Squats strengthen the muscles in the lower limbs whereas lunges are more effective at reducing body fat (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6050697/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>), (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9925109/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>).</p>

<p>Initially, she used to go crazy in the gym but lately, she just works out enough to make her body feel good. She hits the gym at least five days a week since it helps her feel the best of herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Publicly, she also disclosed that initially, she tried yoga and Pilates, but she opted for old-school fitness workouts like boxing.&nbsp; Yoga has been proven an effective method for improving health in addition to the prevention and management of diseases (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415184/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>). On the other hand, boxing is more efficient in developing physical fitness (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326307335_The_impact_of_a_boxing_training_program_on_physical_fitness_and_technical_performance_effectiveness" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>).</p>

<p>For Gwen, being consistent with working out helped her stay in shape and tone her abs. Additionally, she is quite active and spends nights dancing on stage in front of a live audience. In one of the interviews, she revealed that dancing on stage was more like preparing for a marathon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Gwen Stefani&rsquo;s Weight, Fitness, and Wellness Journey</strong></h2>

<p>The American personality also tries to keep her mental and physical health in check.&nbsp; Moreover, she has always prioritized working out and taking breaks whenever she felt her body needed it. Research states that there is a strong link between mental health and physical health, especially when one is aging (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617306639" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>12</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After her split from Gavin Rossdale, her ex-husband in 2015, she focused on spiritual exercising to connect better and live more in the present. She also admitted that she struggled really hard to maintain her size 4 figure even before her pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking about her weight loss, one of the key components for her was staying hydrated, Hence, she drank lots of water and was always on a diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gwen Stefani&rsquo;s diet and urge to consume organic vegetarian food left fans stunned. In fact, she also confessed that she hates talking about her body. She doesn&rsquo;t want her body to define her. She manages to maintain her frame with good decisions and healthy food choices regarding her fitness and diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the songwriter doesn&rsquo;t like to get caught in too much negativity and rumors. She maintains a healthy attitude towards negativity for the sake of her mental health. Last but not least, she urges everyone to find self-acceptance as it is never about how fat or thin you are, it is more about your mind and how you feel as a whole. Her toned figure which she claims to be an accident is purely because of her commitment toward her body.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="6708ee123a7fa"><strong>Rob Lowe&rsquo;s Self-care Tips to Stay Healthy</strong></h2>

<p>For Rob Lowe, a healthy body and a happy heart can be achieved by being consistent with healthy lifestyle habits. According to him, it&rsquo;s not a particular diet, but a way of life that can help one nourish oneself from within. He is a spokesperson for the Atkins low-carb diet because he has been following it for years now and finds it quite sustainable and easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, he takes care of physical fitness, as it helps him relieve stress and calm his head. Adding to that, he focuses on having a good sleep, which further helps him stay fit.&nbsp; Good quality sleep not only calms one&rsquo;s mind but also improves physical health by improving heart health and promoting a healthy weight (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6281147/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Now that we have taken a look at Rob Lowe&rsquo;s diet, it&rsquo;s clear that the actor is determined to set some serious health and fitness goals for years to come. It&rsquo;s not just a mere diet or physical activity that has helped him defy aging &mdash; it&rsquo;s his holistic approach to his health that has paved the way for a healthy body and a happy mind. While we don&rsquo;t encourage going on an Atkins diet (high-protein, low-carb diet) without medical supervision, we do encourage following a healthy lifestyle plan consistently to improve your overall health.</p>

This simple cardio exercise helps her energize and get a boost, especially in her morning workouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>High-intensity Cycling: </strong>In cardio, Beckham also engages in high-intensity cycling at the gym to give a boost to her thigh muscles and calves, while also maintaining a good posture.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="66ebe3641d15c" style="text-align:justify"><strong>Victoria Beckham&rsquo;s Journey with Health, Wellness, And Weight</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the birth of her first child Brooklyn, Beckham&rsquo;s body was harshly criticized by the media. On the front page of a magazine, her postpartum body has arrows pointing at areas where she needed to lose weight. In an interview, she admitted that those things affected her deeply back in the time, which perhaps became the cause of her ultra-strict fitness regime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, she recently acknowledged how she has become more accepting of her appearance and more unapologetic. She seems to have found a balance between a disciplined lifestyle and having fun and knows what works for her.&nbsp; Today, Beckham is very happy about the fact that &ldquo;thinness is becoming old-fashioned&rdquo; and how people care about overall health and fitness more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Victoria Beckham&rsquo;s diet has been a topic of curiosity in the media for a very long time. She doesn&rsquo;t switch up the things she eats very often and sticks to her fish and veggies meals and avocado snacks most of the time. This is a nutritious choice of foods that Beckham has discovered works best for her, which is why she hasn&rsquo;t been keen on changing her diet in the past two decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This extreme decision to follow the same diet every day came after much scrutiny about her body, which made the Spice Girl make a commitment to herself. However, due to the lack of variety in her diet and the lopsided quantity of avocados she consumes, health experts and nutritionists aren&rsquo;t a fan of her diet. Hence, it is not a good idea to hop on the bandwagon if you&rsquo;re looking at losing weight, too.&nbsp;</p>

Research states that being fit or active is associated with a greater than 50% reduction in health-related risks (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Tom suggests starting from a biomechanically neutral position that consists of knees over feet, hips over knees, shoulders over hips, and a firm core. However, if you are not in the correct alignment then you condition your body to be out of balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In one of the videos, Tom Brady&rsquo;s trainer, Alex Guerrero, laid stress upon starting an exercise in an athletic, neutral position by activating core muscles. During a set, when your muscles get exhausted, it is time to stop. According to Tom, when one&rsquo;s form breaks down, it is vital to bring the exercise to a halt.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">To start, Tom performs an active warm-up to stimulate his nervous system and get the blood flowing. For Tom, his trainer Alex uses three types of resistance bands &mdash; handle bands, long-looped resistance bands, and short-looped bands. Resistance training increases in skeletal muscle mass (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254623000601" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>). In addition, a combination of strength and cardio delivers ground force production.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Tom Brady&rsquo;s diet plan and workout regime underscore the importance of living a healthier lifestyle. While he is committed to his TB12 diet even after retirement, he also acknowledges the importance of maintaining the right balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Overall, Tom Brady&#39;s diet method offers insights into making conscious and informed choices about food and lifestyle to support overall well-being and longevity. Additionally, his workout regime is also an intriguing topic for individuals looking to improve their own dietary habits and overall health.</p>

Beyond the obvious boost in physical well-being, consistent training makes you more resistant to diseases, illnesses, and injuries (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>). He notes that people who train regularly often realize, after years of commitment, that they rarely get sick or injured and generally feel good all the time.</p>

<p>Exercise also enhances your quality of sleep and sharpens your mind, which can improve performance at work by reducing errors and increasing patience (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6027933/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>6</u></a>).

She isn&rsquo;t a fan of hitting the gym and does squats to be fit. Squats are one of the most effective exercises to improve core strength, lower body strength, tone glutes and thighs, improve posture, and burn calories (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761779/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The talent, charm, poise, and candor that the veteran singer has is unmatchable. Dolly Parton&rsquo;s diet and fitness routine is a testament to hard work that shows in her energy &mdash; even at the age of 80, she can make heads turn with her grace and ravishing persona. People looking for a sustainable solution to weight loss and eating healthily can for sure take motivation from her and incorporate healthy meals into their diet and improve their health and fitness levels.&nbsp;</p>

However, Gama&rsquo;s drill was not limited to physical conditioning only. He extended his practice to mental conditioning as well. Pehlwan&rsquo;s principles were based on challenging himself to achieve more, for both physical and psychological strength conditioning. He is reported to have exercised for 15 hours daily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing her take on Gama&rsquo;s workout time, our contributor Mary Sabat says, &ldquo;Fifteen hours of daily exercise is extremely uncommon and goes beyond the typical training regimen for even elite athletes. This level of exercise intensity and duration can have significant impacts on an athlete&#39;s body. While it may lead to improved physical performance and conditioning in some cases, it also carries a heightened risk of overtraining, physical exhaustion, injuries, and psychological burnout. It is crucial to emphasize that such an extreme training routine is not common and should only be undertaken with careful planning, monitoring, and consideration of an athlete&#39;s individual needs and goals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The great Gama Pehlwan played more than 5,000 bouts in his career and remained the undefeated wrestling champion<strong> </strong>for five decades. A splendid wrestling career like this is built with innate determination and discipline which is proved evident through Gama Pehlwan&#39;s diet and his extensive training. Gama is known to lift and carry a 1200 kg stone once and is consistently conferred for numerous such stories, singing about his glorifying accolades, titles, and wins. From his diet structure and workout routine, there are a lot of takeaways for anyone looking to physically train and challenge themselves. From a high-protein and nutrient-rich diet to diligent drilling, Gama invested 15 hours every day in his training to achieve what he did at the time. This goes to show that only consistent hard work and trusting the process is the key to working on yourself and striving for your best and fittest version.&nbsp;</p>

He&#39;s into a pretty unique diet that includes -&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Only one meal each day</li>
	<li>A coffee</li>
	<li>Three to four bags of candy</li>
</ul>

<p>During a chat on NBA legend Kevin Garnett&#39;s show, <em>KG Certified</em>, Metcalf had a frank conversation about his athletic nutrition. He surprised Garnett with his not-so-usual food choices. Metcalf admitted, &quot;I might not be the best person to ask about that.&quot;</p>

<p>He mentioned he&#39;s a candy fan and sticks to one meal, one coffee, and munches on about three full bags of candy. Garnett was pretty surprised and asked about the candy types he likes. And Metcalf spilled the beans that he loves gummy candies like Skittles gummies and Lifesaver Creations, preferring them over jelly beans. Garnett was a bit shocked by this revelation and inquired about Metcalf&#39;s entire daily eating routine.</p>

<h3><strong>DK Metcalf&rsquo;s Candy Diet</strong></h3>

<p>Metcalf kicks off his day with a workout on an empty stomach. When hunger kicks in, he heads to Starbucks for coffee, which keeps him full for a good while (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28446037/" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>). Around 4 to 5 pm, he treats himself to candy and water. Finally, his hearty dinner comes around 8 to 9 pm. It&#39;s a schedule that seems to work for him, even if it&#39;s not what you&#39;d call conventional.</p>

<p>Foods like candy that are high in added sugars are known to cause obesity (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6959843/" target="_blank"><u>6</u></a>). But the great news for Metcalf is that being a 6-foot-4, 235-pound NFL player who constantly works out means he burns through calories much faster than the average person. However, even though this helps with calories, it&#39;s not so easy to offset the impact of all that sugar intake. Experts say that eating too much sugar is a big reason for obesity and lots of ongoing health issues like diabetes (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5421126/" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>).</p>

<h2><strong>Does Metcalf Really Consume So Much Candy?</strong></h2>

<p>Maybe DK Metcalf has a high sugar tolerance. But building a chiseled physique like his with 3 to 4 bags of candy per day is quite impossible. During his initial draft training days, he had a personal chef who designed nutrition sheets for DK Metcalf&rsquo;s meal plan. The chef prepared low-carb meals, rich in proteins and veggies, and low in fats and sugars, keeping him in top shape (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892194/" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>). So, his recent surprising statement on the Kevin Garnett podcast took people aback as many anticipated a healthy eating plan reveals.</p>

<p>While health experts might express worries regarding the unbalanced nutrition and elevated sugar intake in his diet, his extraordinary performance on the football field truly showcases his skills.</p>

<p>Genetics also plays a pivotal role in muscle development, fat retention, sugar metabolism, body structure, and virtually every facet of bodybuilding (<a href="https://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.12.2076" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>). Ever since DK made a splash in college football on a national level, it was clear that he possesses exceptional genetic gifts.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>DK Metcalf&#39;s diet and exercise routine offers surprising insights. His genetics and committed training plan evidently contribute to his muscular physique and athletic prowess. He goes beyond the norm by adding extra reps and integrating a mix of cardio, power, and strength exercises. Despite his intense approach, his diet might surprise some, featuring three bags of candies daily. This contrast highlights the individuality of fitness journeys; what suits one person might not suit another.&nbsp;</p>

Key to her compelling presence is her dedication to maintaining a sculpted physique that perfectly complements her many acting roles. Behind the Angelina Jolie figure that many aspire to, there is a meticulous, high-intensity workout regime that ensures she stays in top form. Here&#39;s a rearranged look at Angelina Jolie&#39;s workout plan to maintain her body, from Monday to Friday, with a focus on yoga.</p>

<h3><strong>Jolie&rsquo;s Workout Routine</strong></h3>

</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Day Five - Friday:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
She concludes the weekday workouts with a focus on arms, abs, chest, and shoulders:</p>

	<li>Crunches (15 repetitions)</li>

	<li>Planks (15 repetitions with hold time being one minute)</li>
	<li>30-45 Minutes of cardio activity which can include cycling, running, dancing, or aerobics</li>
</ul>

<p>For all the above exercises, Angelina usually uses a 5-10 lb. dumbbell weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the weekends, Angelina takes a break from these rigorous exercises and indulges in the rejuvenating practice of yoga. Yoga not only tones the muscles but also enhances flexibility and encourages mental peace (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336125375_The_Effects_of_Yoga_Asana_on_Human_Lower_Limb_Muscles" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking about yoga, our contributor Dr. Allen Conrad, says, &ldquo;Yoga is a popular and effective choice for weight loss management. One of the most important ways to lose weight and keep it off is to find an exercise or activity that you enjoy. Yoga is easy to do at home, which means there are less restrictions like having to drive to go to the gym. Yoga promotes flexibility and balance which can help with weight loss in conjunction with a proper diet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from Angelina Jolie&#39;s diet and rigorous workout throughout the week, she incorporates yoga into her weekends to complement her high-intensity weekly regime, demonstrating the importance of balance and mindfulness in maintaining long-term health and fitness. This holistic approach not only tones the body but also offers much-needed mental respite, making her fitness journey a blend of physical agility and mental tranquility (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308077596_Does_yoga_influence_happiness_and_mental_balance_a_comparison_between_yoga_practitioners_and_non_yoga_practitioners" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>)</p>

<h2 id="6672890f23dcb"><strong>Does She Take Any Supplements?</strong></h2>

<p>Angelina Jolie uses certain dietary supplements to manage her health and fitness. These include protein powder for muscle growth and curbing hunger, a multivitamin, zinc, and vitamin C for boosting immunity (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346991436_The_Role_of_Vitamin_C_Vitamin_D_and_Selenium_in_Immune_System_against_COVID-19" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>). She also takes Arnica and Bromelain to help with post-surgery healing and combat inflammation (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6691441_Homeopathic_arnica_therapy_in_patients_receiving_knee_surgery_Results_of_three_randomised_double-blind_trials" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>12</u></a>).</p>

<p>To sum up, the Angelina Jolie figure isn&#39;t an overnight achievement but a result of discipline, dedication, and a rigorous workout regimen. Her Tomb Raider workout, a meticulously crafted balance of strength, cardio, and flexibility exercises, is designed to sculpt every part of the body, maintaining the lean, strong body that has become her trademark. Some critics may label Angelina Jolie too skinny, but she has consistently prioritized a workout routine that fosters overall fitness and strength rather than striving solely for thinness. Precisely, to achieve such heights of perfection and success, following a restricted lifestyle along with Angelina Jolie&#39;s diet is something you can look up to.&nbsp;</p>

He mostly consumed homegrown fruits and vegetables. And, as a pancreatic cancer patient, his eating patterns were extreme and rigid. According to some studies, self-imposed food restriction has many consequences including enhanced emotional responsiveness, dysphoria, and distractibility (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002822396001617" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>1</u></a>). Speaking of digestive processes, the pancreas plays a significant role in the digestion of the nutrients and as such both in chronic and acute pancreatic conditions, digestion and absorption can be impaired that increases the chances of nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521691806000072" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>). Despite dealing with cancer and the unavoidable nutritional dearth, rather than eating properly and frequently, Steve either fasted for days together or ate restrictively.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Steve loved his fruit diet. He consumed a lot of fruits, especially apples. Apples contain water, fiber, vitamins C and E, minerals, etc, and have proven to have cardioprotective benefits (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224416305271" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>3</u></a>). On a lighter note, Steve loved apples so much that he shared that one of his inspirations behind naming the company Apple was his love for apples. Other than that, he consumed dried fruits for breakfast.</p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> For lunch, Steve Jobs only ate fruit and usually consumed the same fruits. Apart from that he preferred either having the same fruits or some carrots and Odwalla carrot juice. Carrots are an excellent source of carotenoids, flavonoids, vitamins, and minerals, and have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, anti-analgesic, and numerous other properties that benefit your health (<a href="https://www.scirp.org/html/5-2701422_52066.htm?crsi=662496660&amp;cicada_org_src=healthwebmagazine.com&amp;cicada_org_mdm=direct" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>4</u></a>). On certain occasions, Steve also had a salad with lemon.</p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Surprisingly, Steve didn&rsquo;t really indulge in fancy dinners or extravagant parties much. He didn&rsquo;t even go for nutritious meals or non-vegetarian delicacies. And, it won&rsquo;t be an understatement to say that his dinner looked exactly like his breakfast and lunch. He consumed carrot salad and fruits for dinner. Fruits and vegetables are a great source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals but they are usually low in energy density (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649719/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>). However, they are also associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases and body weight management (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4644575/" style="text-decoration:none"><u>6</u></a>). Hence, consuming fruits and veggies as a part of a healthy and well-balanced diet is important to reap the benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fasting:</strong> There have been many speculations about Steve fasting for days together as a way of cleansing his body and creating a sense of euphoria. Apart from his fruitarian diet, he consumed a lot of vegetables and water after days of fasting. The odd part is that even after being diagnosed with cancer, Steve Jobs&rsquo; fruit diet didn&rsquo;t change much. Despite his health condition demanding a variety of protein intake, he still refused to make his diet inclusive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Limited Alcohol Consumption: Steve wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan of alcohol. Alcohol consumption has not only been associated with cardiovascular diseases but many other complications including fetal abnormalities, liver cirrhosis, and violence (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6713002/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>). Not to miss, alcohol consumption has also been recognized as a factor affecting individual productivity and performance (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6713002/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>). So, Steve did hold a huge regard for his productivity and didn&#39;t give in to alcohol consumption. However, he did share his obsession with psychedelics, Odwalla juices, and mineral water. On certain occasions, he did have a glass of wine too. The benefits of consuming natural mineral water are many from being &lsquo;microbiologically wholesome&rsquo; to being free from pathogenic microorganisms (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5318167/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>).</p>

<p><strong>Smoothies for Snacks:</strong> Steve Jobs didn&rsquo;t eat much but he was picky about whatever he did eat. He would ask for 8 smoothies at a time only to get a sip from each one of them. It was his way of choosing and having what suited him the most rather than eating for the betterment of his health and recovery. According to some research, consuming a fruit salad is more fulfilling than consuming a fruit smoothie (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946216/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>).</p>

<h2><strong>What Was the Workout Routine of Steve Jobs?</strong></h2>

<p>Steve Jobs&rsquo; acknowledged he was a morning person and woke up as early as 6 a.m. However, it&rsquo;s believed that rather than starting his day with workouts, he went jogging. He would go for extended jogging without setting a certain limit on jogging every day. After dinner, he also went for a walk. Walking has proven to have a beneficial impact on postprandial hyperglycemia when undertaken as soon as possible after the meal (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-022-01808-7" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>). Apart from that, he chose meditation to end his day on a relaxed note. And, meditation has proven to have potential benefits on psychological well-being and cognition (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810016300058" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>12</u></a>).</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>Dietary choices may enhance the overall functioning of our body. However, if they cause nutritional deficiencies or deteriorate our health condition, we may need to reconsider their long-term implications on our bodies. Steve Jobs&rsquo; diet plan did contain the goodness of fruits and vegetables but it lacked the nutrition his body needed especially when he was recovering from pancreatic cancer. So, before continuing with a diet plan, ensure it meets the nutritional requirements of your body that you need for continuous energy and recovery, if any.</p>

These include:</p>

<h3><strong>Individuals with iodine sensitivity or hyperthyroidism:</strong></h3>

<p>Those with iodine sensitivity or those who have been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism should avoid sea moss. Excessive iodine intake may exacerbate these conditions.</p>

<h3><strong>People with bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulant medications:</strong></h3>

<p>Sea moss contains compounds that may have blood-thinning properties. If you have a bleeding disorder or are taking anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin, heparin, or aspirin, it&rsquo;s important to consult with a medical professional before taking sea moss. It may interact with these medications and increase the risk of bleeding.</p>

<h3><strong>Those with known allergies to seaweed, shellfish, or sulfur:</strong></h3>

<p>Some individuals may have existing allergies or sensitivities sea moss. If you have a known allergy to these substances, it&rsquo;s best to avoid sea moss altogether.</p>

<h3><strong>Pregnant or breastfeeding women:</strong></h3>

<p>There is very little research on the safety of sea moss consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It&rsquo;s advisable for pregnant or breastfeeding women to consult with a healthcare professional or doctor before incorporating sea moss into their diet to ensure it is safe for both them and their baby.</p>

<h3><strong>Children:</strong></h3>

<p>Sea moss is not recommended for infants and young children, as their dietary needs and sensitivities differ from adults. It&rsquo;s best to consult with a pediatrician or healthcare professional before introducing sea moss to a child&rsquo;s diet.</p>

<p>As with any new food or dietary supplement, it&rsquo;s essential to consult with a medical professional before including sea moss into your routine. This is especially true if you have any underlying health conditions or concerns. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific situation and help determine if sea moss is suitable for you. Even though there are risks associated with consuming sea moss, it&rsquo;s not necessary that you will experience any of the side effects. A little caution is all that&rsquo;s necessary when consuming any new food, and if you are a little careful, there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t enjoy the benefits of this miracle superfood.</p>

He is a former professional wrestler known for his huge, and muscular body. The Rock has appeared in films like <em>Fast &amp; Furious, Black Adam, </em>and<em> Jumanji</em>. He is also a film producer and co-owner of a professional football league (XFL).</p>

<p>The Rock is equally committed to his workouts as he is to his career. He is renowned for his intense fitness regimens and high-calorie diet.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Profile Check</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Full name: </strong>Dwayne Douglas Johnson</li>
	<li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>May 2, 1972</li>
	<li><strong>Age in 2023:</strong> 51</li>
	<li><strong>Place of birth: </strong>California, US</li>
	<li><strong>Occupation: </strong>Wrestler, actor, film producer, and businessman&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Height: </strong>6 feet 5 inch</li>
	<li><strong>Weight: </strong>118 kg (260 lb)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The Rock&#39;s Diet </strong><strong>- Weight Loss Journey</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Johnson was advised to lose weight in the mid-2000s, after a few years in his movie career. He was instructed to modify his eating habits and abandon the gym. But &#39;The Rock&#39; decided to stay his authentic self.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dwayne Johnson&rsquo;s height and weight suited most of the roles he played. He also made a significant effort for his part in the 2022 movie <em>Black Adam</em>. For this superhuman role, he went to great lengths. He described the rigorous procedure he goes through for his nutrition and exercise on Instagram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He advised managing water, and sodium, and practicing cardio to build dense, well-defined muscles (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723611/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>1</u></a>). It is advisable to limit sodium intake as high sodium levels are linked to muscle weakness, particularly in older individuals (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6916689/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also emphasized the need for weightlifting. Dwayne mentioned that it takes months of commitment to master the underlying science behind it. He collaborates closely with his coach, who regularly monitors his workout plans and makes daily adjustments to them. His workout and diet focused on reducing fat and gaining muscles. According to his strength coach, The Rock worked out 6 days a week and consumed 7 meals every day.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a peek at what his diet and workout plan look like.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Rock&#39;s Diet</strong><strong> - Weight Loss Diet Plan</strong></h2>

<p>Dwayne &#39;The Rock&#39; Johnson consumes a substantial amount of food to meet his body&#39;s demands. His diet typically consists of 7 meals, with a strong emphasis on protein and calories. While this eating pattern may seem challenging for most people, it enables him to fuel his body effectively. Thus The Rock&rsquo;s diet plan includes the following factors.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>1. Calories</strong></h3>

<p>Since he&#39;s very active, the Rock consumes over 5,000 calories most days. To put it in perspective, that&#39;s about twice the recommended calorie intake for most men his age. He needs this energy to support his workouts and build muscle mass (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12094125/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2. Proteins</strong></h3>

<p>The Rock eats 5-7 meals high in protein. His primary sources of protein are cod, steak, chicken, eggs, and protein powder. He takes more than 10 eggs a day which is also proven to aid skeletal muscle gain (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8232167/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>4</u></a>). Furthermore, it is recommended to consume a blend of different proteins for better satiety (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852756/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>3. Carbohydrates</strong></h3>

<p>He also includes plenty of complex carbohydrates like rice, sweet potato, oatmeal, and baked potatoes in his diet. A study has revealed that bodybuilders should aim to include 55 to 60% of carbohydrates in their diet. This high carbohydrate intake plays a crucial role in meeting the energy demands of intense physical training (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15107010/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>6</u></a>). Additionally, a low-carb diet may also have a negative impact on body recovery (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6680710/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>4. Healthy Fats</strong></h3>

<p>To get healthy fats, he includes peanut butter, eggs, coconut oil, and fish oil supplements in his diet. Polyunsaturated fatty acids also have a positive effect on muscle mass (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7761957/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>5. Other nutrients</strong></h3>

<p>He makes sure to include at least a cup of vegetables in his meals, which provides fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. The Rock doesn&#39;t seem to consume much fruit and instead focuses on eating vegetables as his primary source of antioxidants (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6828919/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rock sticks to a strict diet for 6 days a week. He makes sure that all the micro, as well as macronutrients for building the body, are met&nbsp; (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6680710/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>). He considers his rest day as a time for cheat meals which adds flexibility and prevents feelings of deprivation. Apart from cheat days, he limits his consumption of highly processed foods that are high in sugar and refined carbs. However, he doesn&#39;t follow a specific restrictive diet that eliminates entire food groups. Let&rsquo;s look at a sample meal plan to get a better understanding.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Rock&rsquo;s Meal Plan</strong><strong> - One Day Sample (6 days a week)</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Meal 1</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Steak (8 to 10 ounces)</li>
	<li>Eggs (1 whole egg and 3 whites)</li>
	<li>2 cups oatmeal</li>
	<li>Fruit juice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Meal 2</strong></p>

	<li>1 tablespoon fish oil</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The Rock&rsquo;s Cheat Day</strong><strong> (1 day a week)</strong></h2>

<p>When it comes to The Rock&rsquo;s cheat meals, they often involve cheese, fries, and desserts. He&#39;s known to have a sweet tooth and loves indulging in cakes and cookies. Surprisingly, even dieticians support his indulgence mindset because he burns an insane amount of calories. However, for the average person, a cheat day like this could undo a week&#39;s worth of hard work and healthy eating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consuming The Rock&#39;s diet with minimal physical activity would probably result in weight gain for an average person. Instead, it&#39;s preferable to adapt his diet to suit your needs while adhering to some of its basic principles like including high protein, and minimal processed foods.</p>

<h2><strong>The Rock&#39;s Diet</strong><strong> - Daily Workout Routine</strong></h2>

<p>The Rock&#39;s workout routine is not an easy journey. In fact, it&#39;s one of the most demanding fitness routines out there. The intensity of The Rock&#39;s training varies depending on the role he&#39;s preparing for.</p>

<p>He hits the gym 6 days a week and focuses on a different muscle group each day. He typically starts his day with 30-50 minutes of cardio, followed by a protein-packed breakfast to fuel up. Then he moves to his strength training which helps him to build muscle mass (<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.759677/full" style="text-decoration:none"><u>10</u></a>).

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Rock&#39;s diet and workout routine is intense. It may not be suitable if you are beginning your fitness journey. His workouts are more tailored for individuals with experience in resistance training. Likewise, If you&#39;re a beginner, it&#39;s recommended to lower the intensity by reducing sets, reps, and weight. Furthermore, for most people, it&#39;s not necessary to consume as many calories as he does. Instead, focus on following a similar healthy eating style according to your needs. Also, work with qualified professionals. Having a balanced approach to diet and exercise that suits you is always the way to go.</p>

Quite literally&mdash;while you get to satiate with a hearty carb-rich meal, you are also maintaining your weight and blood sugar levels, curbing high blood pressure, and keeping your heart healthy. In addition to this, whole unprocessed carbs like oats, quinoa, red rice, millet, and whole pulses are rich in minerals like magnesium and potassium, antioxidants, and phytochemicals like dietary fiber, and low in sodium, which is cardio-protective in nature (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5996878/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>4</u></a>).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Low-fat foods, which are rich in unsaturated fats like PUFA and MUFA, help lower levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, also known as &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165066/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>),(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5175500/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>),(<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26249220/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>6</u></a>),(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5577766/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>17</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Dr. Allen Conrad further says, &ldquo;Studies have shown that by adding an extra 10 g of fiber to your diet each day, you can reduce the chance of coronary heart disease by 17%. Therefore, we recommend adding extra fiber to your daily diet for good heart health. Different forms of fiber like bran, oats, lentils and flaxseeds are very popular options for adding extra fiber to your nutrition program.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong>8. Nutrient Dense</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">A well-planned high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, particularly one focused on whole plant foods, ensures a high intake of essential nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients abound in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. These nutrients strengthen the immune system, support healthy cellular function, and have antioxidant properties that lower the risk of chronic diseases.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify"><strong>The Truth About High Carb And Low Fat Diet for Weight Loss</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Losing weight on a high-carb diet seems so illogical at first. It defies conventional knowledge. Here are a few details that might help you grasp the novel idea of a high-carb low-fat diet for weight loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While some low-carb followers argue that carbs are responsible for weight gain and that cutting back on them leads to fat loss, scientific evidence suggests that the relationship is more nuanced. Numerous variables affect the effects of carbohydrates on weight gain, so cutting them out completely may not be the best way to lose weight successfully and sustainably (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165066/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>14</u></a>),(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5657137/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>15</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Nutrition Science Initiative (NuSI) found that a high-carb diet did not make participants gain weight in a controlled study of 600 In fact, they still lost body fat on the high-carb diet, about as much as they would have on a low-carb diet. The overweight or obese men in the study were given a high-carb diet for four weeks, and then a low-carb ketogenic diet for an additional four weeks. The calorie content of both diets was the same. Despite the expected increase in insulin levels on the high-carb diet, participants did not gain fat. The subsequent switch to a low-carb diet did not result in any additional fat loss.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Surprisingly, the study discovered that the low-carb diet increased participants&#39; metabolic rate by approximately 40 calories per day, which was the real reason for weight loss. However, this high metabolic rate fades over time and is not sustainable (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28765272/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>18</u></a>).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It is important to note that the study was relatively brief (one-year duration), and the long-term effects may differ. Individual responses to different dietary approaches can vary, so when making food choices, it is important to consider overall calorie intake and nutrient balance and adhere to them.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Carbs And Fats to Be Avoided</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">The entire focus of the HCLF vegan diet depends on choosing a larger portion of complex, healthy carbs and a small number of healthy fats in your regular diet. There are a few foods that are best avoided when following this regimen for best results.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Animal Products&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Fatty cuts of meat, processed meats (like sausages and bacon), and full-cream dairy products (like whole milk, cheese, and butter) are best avoided.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Nuts&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Certain nuts, like almonds and peanuts, have a high-fat content and should be taken in moderation.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Added Sugar</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Foods and beverages with high sugar content, like soda, candies, sugary cereals, and sweetened desserts, are loaded with processed carbs that are detrimental to health.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Sauces And Dressings</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Creamy salad dressings, mayonnaise, and high-fat sauces (such as gravy and cream-based sauces) should be replaced with lighter alternatives to reduce fat intake while on a high-carb low-fat diet.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Fried Snacks And Sweetmeats</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Due to their high-calorie content and potential to cause weight gain, deep-fried foods like potato chips, french fries, and fried chicken, and sweet savories like cookies, cakes, and pastries are typically eliminated from diets.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It is best to work closely with your trainer and your dietician to know what diet suits you the most (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869506/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>19</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Carbs are the ultimate seducers that charm their way onto your plate and then leave you feeling guilty and bloated, yet here we are discussing the not-so-typical high-carb low-fat diet. Like in every walk of life, technology, and science have busted innumerable myths about healthy and unhealthy foods. The propaganda about all carbs being bad has been nullified now; in fact, some of the healthiest foods on the planet are rich in carbohydrates.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">A high-carb diet should be approached with moderation and balance. Consuming excessive sugars in the name of high carbs will be a foolish move. It can lead to insulin resistance and a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes. Choosing healthy sources of fat, like polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, is essential when consuming a high-carb, low-fat diet. Reduce the overall fat intake, step up the good carbs, and see your body transform!</p>

She also shared that she likes &ldquo;eating organic&rdquo; and doesn&rsquo;t allow any indulgences.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast: </strong>Megan shared that she never misses her breakfast. Egg whites, almonds, and oatmeal are her breakfast picks. Quite a good choice as egg protein enhances muscle mass and strength while also preventing physical frailty (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/15/2309" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>1</u></a>). As for almonds, they are rich in fiber, vitamin E, and protein too (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.2659" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>). And, with oatmeal as breakfast, you can never go wrong as it offers higher diet quality and nutrients like protein, fiber, and vitamin A (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0271531715002286" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>3</u></a>).</p>

<p><strong>Lunch: </strong>For lunch, she prefers salmon with rice. Salmon is not only a good source of protein and energy but also quite rich in many vitamins and minerals that make it an excellent choice for lunchtime (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-020-02396-w" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>4</u></a>).</p>

<p><strong>Dinner: </strong>Megan eats chicken breast and quinoa for dinner. Chicken breast has been proven to have higher fat content and lower protein value (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4081/ijas.2014.3138" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>). To balance it out, quinoa which has been recognized as an excellent functional food is rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.4158" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>6</u></a>).</p>

<p><strong>Snack: </strong>For her snack time, Megan likes to have a protein shake and some fruits.</p>

<p>Megan Fox&rsquo;s diet strategy can also be followed by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Avoiding preservatives and artificial colors: Both preservatives and artificial colors are proven to disrupt metabolic activity (<a href="https://drc.bmj.com/content/9/1/e002336.abstract" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>).</li>
	<li>Avoiding processed foods, dairy, and refined sugar: This is also backed by scientific evidence as processed foods and refined sugar are proven to contribute to obesity and significant fat accumulation (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/household-availability-of-ultraprocessed-foods-and-obesity-in-nineteen-european-countries/D63EF7095E8EFE72BD825AFC2F331149" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>), (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/12/5955" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>).</li>
	<li>Limiting the intake of hydrogenated oils: Again, a good choice as hydrogenated oils have proven to cause weight gain and other adverse effects on your body (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561414002428" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>).</li>
	<li>Eating in small portions: Megan eats 5 meals per day rather than binge eating. And, quite clearly, binge eating has been recognized as an eating disorder (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/0801699" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>).</li>
	<li>Following the Keto program: Keto diet has been proven to have a special fat-burning effect as well as reduce the total calorie intake (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915019315898" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>12</u></a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="66055456d0475"><strong>Megan Fox&rsquo;s Daily Workout Routine</strong></h2>

<p>Megan Fox workouts twice or thrice a week. She shared that she does heavy-weight training but also takes short periods of rest. She usually follows a 5 step approach for her workouts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>5-minute warm-up</li>
	<li>Lower body exercise</li>
	<li>Upper body toning</li>
	<li>Sculpting abs</li>
	<li>5-minute cool down</li>
</ul>

<p>Megan Fox&rsquo;s workout routine also involves circuit training that has been proven to improve muscular function (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140135908930423" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>13</u></a>).&nbsp; She also prioritizes pilates, a mind-body exercise that has proven to focus on strength, core stability, flexibility, muscle control, posture, and breathing (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229912000350" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>14</u></a>). However, her workouts are a really diverse variety and also include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spin classes</li>
	<li>Cycling</li>
	<li>Knee push-ups</li>
	<li>Jump squats</li>
	<li>Alternating knee crunches</li>
	<li>Box jumps</li>
	<li>Jump ropes</li>
	<li>Jumping lunges</li>
	<li>Burpees</li>
	<li>Air squats</li>
	<li>V-ups</li>
	<li>Alternating one-legged squats</li>
	<li>8-minute Tabata</li>
	<li>Jogging</li>
	<li>Backward running</li>
	<li>Side shuffles</li>
	<li>Stair jumps</li>
	<li>Sit-ups</li>
</ul>
