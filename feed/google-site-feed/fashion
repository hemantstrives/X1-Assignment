Continuing its celebrated collaboration with internationally acclaimed couturier Rahul Mishra, Tanishq returned to the world&rsquo;s most prestigious fashion platform, unveiling an exceptional high-jewellery presentation centred exclusively on its evocative Desert diamonds collection. Choosing a diamond born of the desert, is choosing something truly unique - a fragment of the earth&rsquo;s history that captures the hues of the land where they are found.<br />
<br />
Building on its continued presence at Paris Couture Week since 2023, <strong>Tanishq&rsquo;s exclusive collection of Desert diamonds</strong>, placed the spotlight firmly on the origin of natural diamonds. Formed in the depths of the earth over millennia, Desert diamonds carry the spirit of the land - connecting each stone back to wild desert landscapes. A spectrum of natural colours, with diamonds ranging from warm whites and honey tones through to whiskey and sunset browns form a palette that&rsquo;s both rare and unmistakable. Prized for their individuality, subtle tonal variations, and depth of character, these stones are considered connoisseur diamonds&mdash;markers of rarity, quiet power, and refined self-expression.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rahul Mishra&rsquo;s Spring 2026 collection, Alchemy</strong>, showcased at Paris Couture Week, <strong>draws inspiration from the cosmic and elemental origins of life</strong>, interpreting the continuity of matter and the transience of existence. It begins at the ether (akasha), the cosmic vastness, the eternal silence; which is not nothingness, but intelligible potential. The impression of air (vayu), its lightness, movement and enormous strength, traced into fabric through instinct and memory. Fire (agni) is the transformational force, like a contemplation. Shapeless by nature, but gives form to anything it touches. Water, (apas) obedient to gravity yet constantly in motion, a mirror to the moon and the world around it, yet humbly adapting to each vessel it inhabits. And Earth, the eternity&rsquo;s ledger of memories. Shaped from the interactions between the other forms, it is a vessel retaining their traces and textures, the force of resilience and tenderness. Rooted in the interplay of air, fire, water, earth, and space, the collection reflects how these classical elements interact and transform&mdash;mirroring the patient formation of diamonds over billions of years. Through texture, scale, and movement, Mishra&rsquo;s couture translates these unseen forces into a poetic narrative, where design echoes nature&rsquo;s rhythms, elemental harmony, and timeless cycles of transformation. This philosophy celebrates creation as a process shaped by time, balance, and quiet resilience&mdash;values intrinsic to both couture and natural diamonds.<br />
<br />
The jewellery showcased in Paris highlighted how <strong>Tanishq&rsquo;s Desert diamonds</strong> bring these natural elements to life, perfectly mirroring the vision of Rahul Mishra. Each rare, naturally coloured diamond was crafted into bold, sculptural silhouettes that celebrate both strength and subtlety, reflecting the desert&rsquo;s timeless landscapes and the slow, meticulous artistry of its formation. Following their <strong>successful launch in the USA</strong>, <strong>Tanishq now introduces these exceptionally rare diamonds to India</strong>, offering connoisseurs and jewellery enthusiasts an opportunity to experience natural diamonds of extraordinary provenance, individuality, and elegance. With scale, form, and thoughtful settings designed to let each stone&rsquo;s brilliance shine, these creations are conceived as wearable art, elevating high jewellery on one of the world&rsquo;s most prestigious fashion platforms.<br />
<br />
Every creation showcased in Paris was the result of extensive design ideation, hundreds of artisanal man-hours, intricate settings, and uncompromising attention to detail&mdash;a testament to Indian artistry that stands confidently among the world&rsquo;s finest. With its fourth appearance at Paris Couture Week, Tanishq continues to strengthen its position as a globally aspirational luxury jewellery brand, engaging with the world&rsquo;s leading maisons on an international stage. The Desert diamonds collection provides a new perspective - a sense of freshness and innovation in natural diamonds and was crafted in collaboration with De Beers Group, the world&rsquo;s leading diamond company.<br />
<br />
<strong>Speaking on Tanishq&rsquo;s continued presence at Paris Couture Week, Pelki Tshering, Chief Marketing Officer, Tanishq, said,&nbsp;</strong><em>&ldquo;Paris Couture Week is where design speaks without borders. For Tanishq, returning for the fourth time reflects our belief that Indian jewellery can engage the world through a shared language of design, rarity, and expression.

Our collaboration with Rahul Mishra allows us to translate this vision onto one of fashion&rsquo;s most influential stages, reinforcing our commitment to creating distinctive natural diamond jewellery that resonates with a new generation of global connoisseurs.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Speaking on the collaboration and the association with Paris Couture Week, Garima Maheshwari, Head of Design, Tanishq, said,&nbsp;</strong><em>&ldquo;Paris Couture Week represents the pinnacle of global luxury and creative expression. Our third presentation with Rahul Mishra marks a deeper creative dialogue between couture and high jewellery, where fashion and craftsmanship move together seamlessly. With Desert Diamonds, we showcased rare natural diamonds shaped by ancient desert landscapes, interpreted through bold, sculptural forms that echoed Rahul Mishra&rsquo;s nature-inspired silhouettes. The collection&rsquo;s natural hues&mdash;ranging from luminous whites to warm champagnes and deep ochres&mdash;were highlighted through intricate settings and meticulous detailing. Each creation was conceived as wearable art, reinforcing our shared commitment to authenticity, rarity, and presenting Indian high jewellery with confidence on a global couture stage.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Speaking on the launch of Dessert Diamonds in India, Shweta Harit, Global Senior Vice President, De Beers, said,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em></strong><em>De Beers has now been a long-standing partner of Tanishq, and together we share a vision of bringing the world&rsquo;s finest natural diamonds to discerning audiences in India.

With Desert diamonds, the ancient sands of time meet today&rsquo;s desire for authentic beauty. Having already launched these exceptional diamonds in the USA, Tanishq is now bringing Desert diamonds to India, unveiling them on the global stage at Paris Couture Week and reinforcing our shared commitment to authenticity and craftsmanship.&rdquo;</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Rahul Mishra, Founder and Creative Director,&nbsp;said,&nbsp;</strong><em>&ldquo;This collaboration with Tanishq is a meeting of philosophies shaped by time, nature, and human hands, and I am honoured to join hands with the legacy and trust created by them. Desert diamonds, formed over billions of years, resonate deeply with my couture collection Alchemy, which explores the elemental forces that bind creation and transformation. Presenting this dialogue at Paris Haute Couture Week allows us to honour rarity, not just in materials, but in thought, process, and craftsmanship. Together, we are telling a story where Indian artistry evolves naturally onto a global stage, rooted in heritage yet expressed through contemporary design.&rdquo;</em><br />

Behind the diva&rsquo;s effortlessly elegant looks is celebrity make-up artist, Shradha Luthra. In an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, Nupur&rsquo;s MUA revealed some big makeup tips for brides-to-be ahead of their weddings. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Nupur Sanon&rsquo;s bridal MUA Shradha Luthra reveals tips for brides-to-be</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/nupur-sanon-stebin-bin-make-first-appearance-as-husband-and-wife-after-udaipur-wedding-kriti-sanon-joins-them-video-1399843">Nupur Sanon</a> took our breath away with her stylish yet elegant look from her wedding to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/nupur-sanon-and-stebin-ben-relationship-timeline-how-did-they-meet-age-difference-and-white-wedding-in-udaipur-1399813">Stebin Ben</a>. While their wedding finery were top notch, the bride&rsquo;s makeup by Shradha Luthra amped up her gorgeous features.</p>

<p>What makeup trends are dominating this wedding season, and which ones are fading out?</p>

<p>This season is all about skin that looks like skin&mdash;luminous, healthy, and effortless. Brides are gravitating towards soft sculpting, flushed cheeks, brushed brows, and understated eyes with depth rather than drama. What&rsquo;s fading out are overly matte bases, harsh contouring, and heavy, cakey finishes. The focus has shifted to timeless beauty rather than trends that feel dated quickly.</p>

<p>What skincare routine would you recommend for brides-to-be starting 2&ndash;3 months before their wedding?</p>

<p>Drink lots of water - that&rsquo;s the most important step. Hydration from within truly shows on the skin. This phase is not about experimenting or trying anything new. Stick to what your skin already responds well to, keep it simple, and focus on consistency rather than trends.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your advice on choosing the right foundation shade and finish for Indian skin tones?</p>

<p>Indian skin tones are incredibly diverse and often have beautiful undertones. Always match foundation to the neck and chest, not just the face. I prefer skin-like, radiant finishes that enhance natural warmth rather than flatten it. The goal is for the foundation to disappear into the skin, not announce itself.</p>

<p>How do you balance makeup with heavy bridal outfits and jewellery?</p>

<p>Balance is everything. If the outfit and jewellery are heavy, the makeup should elevate, not compete. I focus on glowing skin, well-defined but soft eyes, and harmonious tones that tie the entire look together. Bridal beauty should feel cohesive and refined, not overpowering.</p>

<p>You recently did makeup for Nupur Sanon on her wedding&mdash;what was the inspiration behind her bridal look?</p>

<p>The inspiration was Nupur herself. We wanted her to look like the most elevated version of who she is: fresh, radiant, and timeless. The idea was effortless elegance with glowing skin, soft eyes, and a look that would age beautifully in photographs years from now.</p>

<p>Were there any special requests from Nupur that made her bridal look unique?</p>

<p>What truly made Nupur&rsquo;s bridal look unique was that she had two very different ceremonies. A Christian wedding and a Hindu wedding, yet her intention for both remained the same: she wanted to look like herself. One of the key inspirations for me was the beautiful hue of her lehenga, which I translated subtly onto her face to create harmony between the outfit and the makeup. There weren&rsquo;t any specific requests as such. Just complete trust. Her approach was about feeling like the best version of herself, and I think that perfectly reflects the bride of today. That trust allowed us to create something timeless, personal, and deeply aligned with my aesthetic.</p>

Innerwear that moulds to your body with flawless ease, delivering a second-skin sensation without compromise.</p>

<p>The collection features five versatile bra styles.

<p>Designed for a seamless look with no visible stitch lines, this innerwear collection delivers unmatched comfort, moves with your body and stays strong wear after wear. It also provides a lightweight feel that&rsquo;s impossibly thin yet endlessly supportive.</p>

<p>With price points ranging between Rs 1209 &ndash;1729, this collection is designed for women who believe that feeling extraordinary should be an everyday experience. Each piece becomes more than just innerwear; it&rsquo;s a ritual of self-care, quiet celebration, and love for oneself.</p>

<p>Additionally, what takes care of bra fit concerns is the brand&rsquo;s &ldquo;Self-Size Check,&rdquo; initiative that&rsquo;s live at selected Exclusive Stores. This on-store bra fitting service helps women find their perfect bra by measuring themselves using a few simple steps.</p>

<p>Aryan Khan&rsquo;s sister, Suhana Khan, stole the show in a striking mustard-yellow Versace evening gown with a bold and glamorous appeal. Her floor-length gown had an asymmetric draped neckline and a thigh-high slit, which not only added drama but a lot of oomph.</p>

<p>The gown featured a single-shoulder draped neckline with ruching across the entire left side, even on the sleeves. The other side has a thin strap, which is adorned with metallic detailing, adding a touch of edginess. Suhana completed her look with golden stilettos and left her hair open while styling it in soft curls. The dress cost her a bomb. It was around Rs 2,95,000. &nbsp;</p>

For Anaita, characters come first. &ldquo;I approach actors as characters first, then actors, shaping their look from the inside out,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what she said about trends and Hrithik&rsquo;s role</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a stylist who creates a look thinking, &lsquo;Oh, this will become a trend and everyone will start wearing it.&rsquo; But has that happened? Absolutely,&rdquo; Anaita said. She noted that the&nbsp;song Aavan Jaavan, with Hrithik and Kiara, has &ldquo;really struck a chord&rdquo; and introduced new style combinations and colors people want to try.</p>

<p><strong>Will War 2 influence summer fashion?</strong></p>

<p>Anaita believes the relaxed, travel-oriented styling could ripple into summer wardrobes. She praised Hrithik&rsquo;s style sense: &ldquo;Hrithik is always on board, but he&rsquo;s also incredibly smart about style; he understands proportions instinctively.&rdquo; She also highlighted practical prep: paying attention to movement and choreography so clothes read well on camera.</p>

<p>Anaita closed on a personal note: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had so much fun with it, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to see the appreciation our work is getting.&rdquo; For fans tracking Anaita Shroff Adajania, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/hrithik-roshans-speech-at-war-2-pre-release-event-goes-viral-showers-praises-on-ntr-i-have-learnt-from-you-1395396">Hrithik Roshan</a> and War 2 fashion, the song&rsquo;s looks may offer clear cues for the season ahead.</p>

<p>Speaking about how models are exploited during fashion&nbsp;weeks, she added, &quot;People are getting 15-20k per day for walking 3-4 shows, being there for 12 hours, doing hair and makeup, and paying for their own travel and stay in the city.&quot;</p>

<h3><strong>Roshni urges models to ask for &#39;better budget&#39;</strong></h3>

<p>&quot;The rates for a fashion week, especially for a pool model, should be around 40k minimum per day and the stay and travel should be included&mdash;if you are someone with experience and have walked a lot, please don&rsquo;t feel insecure and ask for a better budget if you think you deserve it,&quot; an excerpt from her post reads.</p>

<p>&quot;When you walk as a model, you are basically putting in efforts of being in measurements that is very very difficult to maintain with the right kind of food and the right kind of wellness routine (sic),&quot; she added.</p>

<p>Roshni further urged other models to pitch themselves at the right &quot;rate&quot; without being exploited.</p>

<p>Netizens praised the model&nbsp;in the comment section for bringing out the issue in public. Now, it is to be seen if such concerns&nbsp;will be heard to make the fashion industry a better workplace.</p>

Her untouched world felt like a time capsule, suspended in lace and decay. I drew from that mood&mdash;layered tulle, crumbling silks, and beads that feel like they&rsquo;ve lived a life before. The silhouettes nod to Regency shapes- empire lines, corseted waists, but softened and deconstructed, like heirlooms passed down and altered with time.</p>

<p><strong>Q. With the popularity of Regency fashion through shows like Bridgerton, are we going to witness some similarities in your collection?</strong></p>

<p>Bridgerton brought Regency fashion back into the cultural conversation, but Aurelia speaks a more intimate language. While you may see certain cues, structured bodices, puffed sleeves, or high waistlines, the treatment is quieter, less theatrical. For me, it&#39;s not about recreating the period, but about creating something that feels like it could have been part of it... or perhaps whispered through it.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How expressionist do you think your collection Aurelia, would be from other fashion labels, who are ready to experiment and tweak the classic fashion picks?</strong></p>

<p>Aurelia doesn&rsquo;t just tweak the classics - it haunts them. It&rsquo;s deeply emotional, almost cinematic in how it approaches storytelling through fabric. Each piece carries layers&ndash; of craftsmanship, reference, and intention. It&rsquo;s less about trends and more about feeling. Where others might modernize a silhouette, we let it unravel a bit. There&rsquo;s imperfection, rawness, and a softness that comes from restraint.</p>

<p><strong>Q. You redesigned Samantha Ruth Prabhu&#39;s wedding outfit. Share with us your vision and her vision and how you carried forward the process, as there were emotions attached to it.</strong></p>

<p>That piece was more than a garment&mdash;it was a memory stitched into something new. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/exclusive-samantha-ruth-prabhu-and-raj-nidimoru-are-moving-in-together-scouting-for-properties-1387793">Samantha</a> wanted to reclaim something deeply personal, and I felt honored to be part of that process.

<p>The fashion critics took to their official channel and claimed that the embellished mini-dress was sourced from a brand called The Source Bombay. They even stated that they contacted the brand, which confirmed that the designer had indeed sourced the outfit from them. The critics added that while the caption might have referred specifically to the cape, presenting it as if the entire outfit was self-made came off as misleading.</p>

The bright green hue complemented her skin tone impeccably.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Sharvari dialed up the drama with glamorous make-up, Jacqueline chose to keep it minimal and demure for the red carpet. Whose style resonates with you more?</p>
