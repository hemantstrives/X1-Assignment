Premiered in 2009, it has consistently remained a favorite among viewers, captivating hearts with its compelling storytelling, rich cultural themes, and memorable characters. Set against the backdrop of Udaipur, Rajasthan, the show earlier revolved around Akshara (played by Hina Khan) and Naitik&#39;s (played by Karan Mehra) lives. Their on-screen chemistry, the show&#39;s sudden twists and turns, generation leaps and the introduction of new actors made the daily soap more and more interesting.</p>

<p>After <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news-gossip/hina-khan-looks-enchanting-she-dons-pretty-green-ensemble-her-outing-pics-1164759">Hina Khan </a></strong>and Karan Mehra, Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai revolved around Akshara and Naitik&#39;s daughter Naira&#39;s (played by Shivangi Joshi) life. Eloping from her house to falling in love with Kartik (played by Mohsin Khan), this track was also immensely loved by the viewers who welcomed this new pair with open arms. Their on-screen romance, relatable storyline, and fresh plot twists only contributed to the show&#39;s success. After introducing a 12-year-generation leap, the show revolved around Naira and Kartik&#39;s daughter Akshara&#39;s life. The show then featured <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/yeh-rishta-kya-kehlata-hai-actress-pranali-rathods-fees-per-episode-will-leave-you-amazed-find-out-1226215">Pranali Rathod </a></strong>and Harshad Chopda in lead roles and currently, it revolves around them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in the past 14 years, there have been several actors who left the Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai midway or their journey in the show ended due to a change in the storyline. But these actors and their characters etched their mark on the hearts of the viewers.

He couldn&#39;t help but chuckle at his silliness as he found himself enamored with a simple balloon. It was one of those rare moments of pure joy that came from the simplest of things. He had a wide grin on his face, completely lost in the whimsy of the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rakhi, intrigued by Karan&#39;s unusual display of happiness, approaches him. As she walked over, he was taken aback by her sudden appearance. She asks him about the balloon and tells him that also likes balloons. She asks him if she can keep the balloon but Karan denies saying that it is his balloon. Rakhi says that no one has given him the balloon but he found it so technically it doesn&#39;t belong to him. Karan says that it is his balloon only and he loves the balloon so much and wants to keep it. Rakhi burst into laughter, teasing him about his childlike attachment to the balloon. Karan also laughs and admits that he is a bit childish.</p>

<p>Their playful banter continued, with Rakhi gently poking fun at Karan for his affection toward the balloon. She couldn&#39;t resist hugging him and telling him how much she loved him. Karan, touched by her affection, says that he loves her too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shambhu was growing increasingly frustrated as he repeatedly called Nidhi. He was blackmailing Nidhi and was demanding the money he believed she owed him. Nidhi promptly disconnects the call, causing his anger to escalate. Nidhi blocked Shambhu&rsquo;s number and thought about a new plan. However, Shambhu was not one to give up easily. He decided to take matters into his own hands and headed straight to the Luthra house to confront Nidhi in person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shrishti requested Preeta not to scold her today. Preeta didn&rsquo;t say anything but offered Prasad to Shrishti from the puja she had attended earlier. Srishti apologizes to Preeta.</p>

<p>Preeta then asks Srishti if she has any plans for the day or if she is free would visit the Luthra house with her. Shrishti, however, quickly fabricated an excuse, claiming to have some important work that required Preeta&#39;s assistance.</p>

<p>Their conversation was interrupted as Gurpreet brought them tea. Shanaya joined them, and a playful tussle for the teacup ensued between Shanaya and Mohit.</p>

<p>Preeta sensed Shrishti&#39;s hesitance about visiting the Luthra house, puzzling her. Resolving to go alone, she watched as Rajveer prepared for work, only for Shanaya to boldly flirt with him. In the presence of Preeta and Srishti, Shanaya&#39;s behavior left them both astonished. Srishti inquired about Shanaya, with Mohit clarifying that there was no romantic involvement between Rajveer and Shanaya.</p>

<p>Preeta asks Rajveer if he loves someone else and has a relationship, but Rajveer simply denies it. Gurpreet takes Shanaya aside and scolds her for flirting with Rajveer like this. She asks her to sway away from him. Gurpreet tells her that Rajveer loves someone else and tells her everything about Rajveer and Palki&rsquo;s love story. Shanaya says there is nothing like that and even when she confronted Palki about this she refused. Gurpreet says that Palki never shares her feelings with anyone. Shanaya disapproves of this and tells Gurpreet that she is dating Rajveer and leaves there. Gurpreet asks Palki about Rajveer and Shanaya&rsquo;s relationship and she regretfully accepts it. Gurpreet felt bad for Palki as she could see love in her eyes.</p>

<p>Gurpreet cannot believe it. She knows that Rajveer loves Palki and she thinks that they both are made for each other. Shanaya, however, plays her little games and sticks to Rajveer. Srishti says that Rajveer cannot take both Shanaya and Palki on his bike, upon which Palki says that she is happy to travel alone. Preeta says that she will go out after some time so Palki can come with her. Rajveer informs everyone that his bike is in service so he will take a cab and can take both Paki and Shanay with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karan was looking for Rishabh. He explained to Rakhi that he needed Rishabh&#39;s help in selecting an outfit for an upcoming inauguration event. Nidhi offered to choose his clothes for him. Karan couldn&#39;t help but express his disapproval of Nidhi&#39;s taste. Rakhi playfully teased Karan about his fashion choices.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rajveer, Palki, and Shanaya come to Luthra&rsquo;s house. Girish brought his wife, Girja, along with him. Rakhi introduced Girja to the family and humorously warned her that if she ever saw a new woman in the house, she should know that she was Karan&#39;s wife. Rakhi kindly requested that Girja refrain from bothering Nidhi during her stay.</p>

<p>Shaurya enlists Nidhi&#39;s assistance in choosing the perfect outfit for the celebration, aiming to make a striking impression. Nidhi curiously asks why he brought Shayana along for shopping. Shaurya explains that Shanaya is more of a wannabe, but his thoughts are consumed by Rajveer and his sinister agenda. Suddenly, Shaurya discovers that Shanaya, Palki, and Rajveer have arrived at the location, prompting him to hurry and greet them.</p>

<p>Preeta arrived at the Luthra house. However, as she entered, she noticed that everyone in the living room had suddenly vanished. Perplexed, she began looking for Nidhi, determined to confront her about the attack in the hospital.</p>

<p>Girja, spotting Preeta, immediately assumes she&#39;s Karan&#39;s wife and requests her help in selecting clothes for him. However, Preeta clarifies she&#39;s not married, leaving Girja to speculate they might have had a quarrel. Meanwhile, Preeta continues her search for Nidhi&#39;s room, and Karan senses her proximity.</p>

Romil knocked on the door, anxiously waiting for his friend to open the door. Anupamaa&#39;s gaze fixated on him. Her eyes are filled with curiosity and concern, she is still praying for her assumption about Romil to be wrong. Romil, getting restless and unable to delay any longer, retrieved a set of spare keys hidden beneath a potted plant and let himself in. &nbsp;The moment he stepped inside, shock coursed through him like an electric current. His eyes fell upon something that sent shivers down his spine.</p>

<p>Anupamaa got close to the door and started looking inside. Peering into the house from the doorway she noticed Pakhi&#39;s handbag on a table. Panic seized her, and she called out for her daughter, her voice trembling with fear. She cried Sweety&rsquo;s name and ran inside the house. She took the handbag and started crying. She turned to Romil, her voice trembling, and demanded to know the whereabouts of her daughter.</p>

<p>Romil was taken aback by Anupamaa&#39;s sudden appearance and her distress. Anxiously, Anupamaa rummaged through Pakhi&#39;s purse, looking for her phone but she couldn&rsquo;t find it. Romil started crying and slapping himself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Vanraj was leaving the home but Leela stopped and asked him where he was going. Vanraj said that he couldn&#39;t wait any longer and was setting out to search for Pakhi himself. He said that he would not rest until he found Pakhi. Samar and Toshu stop Vanraj and tell him that they will go out and look for Pakhi. Toshu tells Samar that he knows some people who can help them find Pakhi, however, they are very dangerous. Determined to find Pakhi, Samar agreed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Anupamaa scrutinized her surroundings to look for any sign of Pakhi. She asked Romil again and demanded that he should speak up. Anupamaa said that Romil saw them crying, looking for their daughter but he still chose to remain silent. She recounted how they had filed a police complaint, leading to Adhik&#39;s arrest, but Romil had chosen to withhold everything from them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anupamaa asked Romil to tell her everything but Romil started shivering. Anupamaa grabbed Romil by the collar and forcefully led him out of the house.</p>

<p>Back at the Shah house, Leela expresses her concerns about Pakhi&#39;s safety and prays to Kanha Ji. Hasmukh urged her to remain optimistic, but Leela couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that the world was a dangerous place, and everyone harbored such fears. Dimpy supports Leela and says that Pakhi has undeniable strength and resilience and she wouldn&rsquo;t let anything bad happen to her. Kavya added that Pakhi possessed both Vanraj&#39;s anger and Anupamaa&#39;s fortitude, which would serve her well in difficult situations</p>

<p>While Toshu was driving, a girl came in front of their car whose attire resembled Pakhi&#39;s. Excitement surged through them, and they rushed to approach her. However, their hopes were quickly dashed when they realized that she was not Pakhi but a stranger recording a video for social media. Toshu scolded her for her recklessness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Anupamaa confronted Romil. She dragged him by his collar and Romil started crying and begs for mercy. She accused Romil of remaining silent despite witnessing their anguish. She reminded him that she had extended her trust by welcoming him into their home, but he had betrayed that trust by kidnapping her daughter. As Romil tearfully begged for a chance to explain, Anupamaa&#39;s frustration reached its breaking point. She refused to accept his apologies and insisted on knowing the whereabouts of her daughter.</p>

<p>In the midst of this turmoil, Romil confessed that he kidnapped Pakhi. He recounted overhearing Pakhi&#39;s conversation with Adhik, learning that she was planning to visit Shah House for the Rakhi celebration. Romil asks his friend to call Pakhi and tell her that he is Adhik&rsquo;s friend, requesting her to help him in planning a surprise for Adhik. He convinced her to leave the house without informing anyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Romil further explained that he only planned to keep Pakhi for one night and then leave her in the morning, however, she escaped. Romil said that he never planned to hurt anyone, it was just a prank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anupamaa&#39;s anger flared. She asked him why he did all this. Romil said that since the day he kept his foot in the house Adhik and Pakhi were making his life a living hell. Even Adhik framed him for stealing the money and Pakhi supported him. He said that he was just looking to get them back by doing this prank, it was merely a tit-for-tat situation. Anupamaa slapped Romil.</p>

<p>Toshu and Samar reached a gang member. He told them that Pakhi hadn&rsquo;t been kidnapped, but he was worried that this might be a job or human trafficking. Samar was devastated by this revelation, and Toshu struggled to hold back his emotions, fearing the worst.</p>

The actress was a part of the show for more than a decade and her acting prowess was applauded by the viewers. However, after taking an abrupt exit from the sitcom, Neha has been away from the screens. Though she has maintained an active social media presence, but fans miss her seeing performing and are eagerly waiting for her to return. Well, there&#39;s good news for Neha Mehta&#39;s fans as she is all set to return to acting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Neha Mehta returns to acting:</strong></h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/neha-mehta">Neha Mehta</a>,&nbsp;</strong>who started her acting journey with Gujarati theatre, is back on stage after 12 years and this time around with a Hindi play. In her upcoming play, she will portray Vaidehi in Sanjay Jha&rsquo;s Dil Abhi Bhara Nahi. While talking about returning to theatre, Neha told India Forums, &quot;I feel blessed to be offered an author-backed role in the play just like my TV shows Dollar Bahu, Chando She Shamdo, Pannlal Patel, and Chand Ko Kaho Chhup Jaye. This has made my journey all the more worth it.&quot;</p>

<p>The Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah&#39;s former actress continued, &quot;I could have taken up another TV show, but I decided to return to Gujarat and reconnect with my roots. My parents asked me whether I wanted to continue doing what I was doing and I knew I wanted to learn, evolve, and explore new aspects of life. I have come to realise that whenever I have run after money, good fortune has always stopped me by some means for my complete growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When asked if she plans to return to TV, Neha explained, &ldquo;After working on good projects, I wouldn&rsquo;t like to ask for work or bow down to someone&rsquo;s conditions. I wish to change that about me as it is said that until you don&rsquo;t ask, you don&rsquo;t get. Before I get there, I will keep polishing myself.

The actor jokes around contestants and is often trapped by contestant&#39;s fan request.</p>

<p>In a recent episode, two remarkable female contestants, Neeru Pandey and Chhavi, dedicated to championing the rights of villagers and the development of rural areas, were featured. However, it was an audio question during the episode that left the iconic Sholay actor feeling embarrassed.</p>

<p>The audio question was from the iconic movie Laawaris and the song was &#39;Mere Angne Mein,&#39; which is one of the most popular cult songs of the 70&#39;s Bollywood.</p>

<h2><strong>Amitabh Bachchan drops a backstory to his iconic song</strong></h2>

He requested to stop the audio. He revealed about its making and how the director had added the song to the film.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Iss gaane ke peeche bohot saara ithihaas hain (There is a lot of history behind this song). This is a folk song and is usually played in the villages since my childhood, I have heard that Babuji used to sing this during the Holi, and my director Prakash Mehraji one day came and told me that he would like to take this song. I was like what do you mean by that, Prakashji said that he wants it in his new film. So I was like I have very bad voice notes so I denied it. Prakashji said no no you will sing as you sing in Holi. With a lot of difficulty, I sang it&hellip; No no, I won&rsquo;t sing this song here please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The audience demanded him to sing the song but the actor was too shy and requested that he would not be singing.</p>

<h2><strong>Amitabh Bachchan&#39;s upcoming projects</strong></h2>

<p>The veteran actor&nbsp;will be seen in Project K aka&nbsp;Kalki 2898 with Prabhas and Deepika Padukone.</p>

<p>Pooja is currently seen in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/war-movies-on-netflix-1235182">Netflix</a>&#39;s Guns and Gulaabs shared her beautiful experience on the sets. Upon asking how was her transition from daily soaps to OTT, she said,&nbsp;&quot;I have spent considerable time in the TV industry to realize that as an actor, your job is to do complete justice to your part and leave the rest to the Almighty. OTT doesn&rsquo;t have a TRP mechanism as such, since the entire series comes out in one go, the success or failure is cast in stone, while with TV, the ratings come every week, and the makers get an opportunity to alter the track on the go to suit the taste of the audience.&quot;</p>

<p>She also said how TV&nbsp;and OTT changed the perception of storytelling and some hard-hitting themes can be easily delivered on OTT. Talking about her experience working alongside Dulqueer Salman she said that the actor is a complete gentleman and is a hard-working actor.</p>

<p>She mentioned that preparing for her character Madhu in the OTT series involved excitement, especially due to the 90s costumes and dialogues, making it an easy process for the actress.</p>

<h2><strong>Pooja Gor&#39;s upcoming projects</strong></h2>

<p>During her interview, Pooja also said that she will soon be venturing into a series helmed by Abhinav Sinha&#39;s Flight into&nbsp;Fear and is going to make her debut in a Gujarati movie alongside&nbsp;Siddharth Randeria. &quot;I owe a big part of my success to TV.

From being a well-known television star to featuring in some successful films, the actress has had an incredible journey in the showbiz world and has gained immense success. Over the years, she went on to be a part of several films, web shows, music videos and showcased her acting prowess. Apart from her talent, she was also praised for her style sense and good looks.

<h2><strong>Gauahar Khan reveals she was advised to not do&nbsp;Ranbir Kapoor starrer Rocket Singh:</strong></h2>

<p>Gauahar Khan opened up about being judged as an actor. The Bigg Boss fame shared how actors are judged if they are not the lead opposite another actor. She said, &quot;I left this norm after the first film itself. I was told that if I am not opposite <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/ranbir-kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor </a></strong>in Rocket Singh (Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year), then I shouldn&#39;t do it, a lot of people like my friends and family told me. Because that was the perception, if you&#39;re not opposite someone, you&#39;re not the star of the film. And the way Rocket Singh turned out for me, I don&#39;t have to prove anything. Because when I had read, I thought this is the only girl impactful to the screenplay because there is so much happening with this group. I have left this norm long ago.&quot;</p>

<p>Gauahar Khan has been part of the industry for a long time and appeared in several films such as Ishaqzaade, Begum Jaan, and many more.

The Khatron Ke Khiladi 12 fame star has gained a massive fan following on his social media platforms. From creating interesting content to showcasing his dancing skills on Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 10, Faisu has donned several hats and impressed fans consistently. Now, he has achieved a new milestone by releasing his chat show which was first graced by Jannat Zubair and then Shiv Thakare. In an interview with Faisu, Shiv spilled beans about his early life, dating life, and professional commitments that will keep the audience intrigued.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Shiv Thakare reacts to dating rumors with Daisy Shah:</strong></h2>

<p>Amidst the conversation, Faisal Shaikh aka Mr. Faisu teased Shiv Thakare with <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/daisy-shah">Daisy Shah&#39;s </a></strong>name and said, &quot;Shiv Thakare ki har subah Daisy hoti hai.&quot; Reacting to this, Shiv added, &quot;Nahi yaar, na subah hoti hai, na raat hoti hai na dupher hoti hai&quot; He further elaborated, &quot;I have a strong bond with Dino (Dino James).&quot; Giving an example of a movie, Shiv stated, &quot;But nowadays people don&#39;t like Brother movie, people like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai more (Faisu and Shiv laugh). You release Brother and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai but people will like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai more.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

There were three people but only our video (Shiv and Daisy) was captured. They played the video in slow motion and added a song and a heart (laughs). If I was an audience, then even I would have thought that there was something brewing. But I thought it is fine, it is not even audience&#39;s fault, movies anyway keep running.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/shiv-thakare">Shiv Thakare </a></strong>added how he doesn&#39;t like encashing via maintaining fake friendships. He said, &quot;I have a rule. I don&#39;t like encashing through friendships. Some people said it&#39;s okay to showcase fake friendships, I told them that I don&#39;t want to have fake friends. If I want to maintain a relationship, I will keep it private, I don&#39;t want to encash it by showing it in front of the people.&quot;</p>

<p>For the uninformed, rumors of Shiv Thakare and Daisy Shah began when they were shooting for Rohit Shetty-led show <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/khatron-ke-khiladi-13-fame-archana-gautam-grooves-to-retro-jam-jawani-janeman-watch-1242251">Khatron Ke Khiladi 13</a></strong> in Cape Town, South Africa.

The vendor suggests that Preeta buy a balloon and release it into the air, believing that one of them will find its way to her true love. Preeta, empathetic to the vendor&#39;s struggles, decides to purchase the balloons.</p>

<p>She makes a heartfelt wish to reach the balloon to the destined person. Srishti, questions Preeta about her cryptic remarks, to which Preeta says that she was merely speaking to the vendor and wanted to help her out. She explains that the vendor&#39;s words touched her, and she released the balloons with a heartfelt wish for them to find their way to where they truly belonged. Srishti gets worried hearing this and asks Preeta if she remembers anything. Preeta denies.</p>

<p>As the balloons soar into the sky, Preeta expresses her desire for at least one of them to reach its intended destination. Some of the heart-shaped balloons inadvertently find their way into Karan&#39;s car. Seeing the balloons, Karan and Rishabh share a light-hearted laugh.</p>

<p>Srishti sees Karan and can&rsquo;t believe that Preeta&rsquo;s heart-shaped balloon actually reached Karan. Panicked by the thought of Karan and Preeta coming into contact, Srishti rushes to intercept Preeta. She hides her face and approaches Karan, taking the balloons from him before he can see them. Karan, bemused by Srishti&#39;s behavior, informs her that there are two more balloons in the backseat of his car.</p>

<p>With the signal turning green, Karan drives away, leaving Srishti in a state of relief and satisfaction that she managed to prevent the potentially awkward encounter between Karan and Preeta.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shanaya sees Rajveer on the balcony and walks towards him. She tells him that he is very handsome. Shanaya goes as far as to claim that Rajveer is her boyfriend and expresses her relief that Palki and Rajveer are not romantically involved. Shanaya&#39;s blatant disregard for Palki&#39;s feelings fuels Palki&#39;s jealousy and discomfort.</p>

<p>Rajveer looks at Palki and both waves. Rajveer is relieved to see that Palki doesn&#39;t appear to be angry with him. Meanwhile, Sandy approaches Shaurya and tells him that they should go out for a party. However, Shaurya is thinking about Shanaya. Shaurya wants to use Shanaya to hurt Rajveer. He believes that by making Shanaya betray Rajveer&#39;s trust, he can inflict emotional pain on Rajveer.</p>

<p>Karan and Rishabh return home, and Sandy appears to be somewhat apprehensive around Rishabh. In a stern yet affectionate conversation with Shaurya, Karan emphasizes the importance of their father-son relationship. He assures Shaurya that he loves him a lot and vows to protect him from life&#39;s challenges and adversities. Karan advises Shaurya not to hurt Kavya, and to treat her with love and respect, like a queen.</p>

<p>Rishabh intervenes in their conversation and asks Karan not to take the matter further and argue. He urges everyone to keep calm as Janmashtmi is approaching. Karan acknowledges his brother&#39;s point, although he struggles with his concern for Shaurya&#39;s behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preeta and Srishti return to their home. Preeta shares her thoughts and feelings with Srishti. She said that she felt a strange feeling when she was releasing the heart-shaped balloons into the sky. She tells Srishti that she gets vivid images from her past. Preeta requests Srishti to tell her about her past, upon which Srishti says that all the relatives, friends, and family died so they don&rsquo;t have anyone. Preeta cannot shake the feeling that she is being targeted by an enemy with a deep-seated hatred, but she is determined to uncover the truth.</p>

Faisu mentioned that he wishes he could have been on Bigg Boss 16 with Shiv. In response, Shiv explained that Bigg Boss can be challenging when it comes to making friends because some people pretend to be fake, which makes it difficult to trust them.</p>

He encouraged Faisu, saying he&#39;d have a lot of fun, and people would love him if he ever joined Bigg Boss. Shiv shared that based on Mr. Faisu&#39;s journey, he would easily survive in the Bigg Boss house.</p>

Romil, who had initially appeared confident and composed, now begins to worry as he witnesses Adhik&#39;s return. He starts thinking about why the police released Adhik so soon and whether this is a warning sign for him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Adhik seems perplexed by Romil&#39;s reaction, pondering why Romil is so concerned upon seeing him. Meanwhile, Barkha expresses her gratitude to Anupamaa for trusting Adhik, to which Anupamaa responds that she has stopped doubting him only for this matter but she didn&rsquo;t trust him.</p>

<p>Anuj suggests that everyone should rest for a while and then search for Pakhi. Anupamaa, however, adamantly states that she will not rest until her daughter is found. Anuj, showing his concern, questions her effectiveness in finding Pakhi by merely standing in one place. Ankush agrees with Anuj. Anupamaa denies it, seeing this Ankush suggests Anuj to go to the police station. Romil is preoccupied with thoughts about what Adhik might have revealed to the police.</p>

<p>Anuj informs everyone that police will be coming to Kapadia Mention to investigate further. They want to check Pakhi&rsquo;s room and will be checking everyone&rsquo;s phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hearing this, Romnil gets more worried and his hands start shaking uncontrollably. Romil leaves from there, but Anupamaa sees this. He retreats to his room, trying to conceal his growing fear and concern.</p>

<p>The next day, Anupamaa surprises Anuj with a heartfelt birthday wish, presenting him with a rose and a touching poem. Anuj is moved by her thoughtful gesture, thanking her for remembering his birthday even during such trying times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anupamaa expresses her belief that moments of happiness should not be missed, even in the midst of sorrow. She openly declares her love for both her daughter and her husband, apologizing for her limited ability to celebrate the occasion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anuj, deeply touched, assures her that her gesture is more than enough and expresses his gratitude for her remembrance. He recounts how they met and celebrated his birthday for the first time in Shah House, reminiscing about the special moment. Anuj expresses his love for her and looks forward to celebrating once Pakhi returns. Anupamaa and Anuj pray to Kanha Ji for good news in this time of sorrow on the auspicious day of Janmashtami.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Vanraj offers prayers to God, seeking protection for his children, especially Pakhi. Simultaneously, Anupamaa does Krishna Janmasthmi aarti at her home praying for her daughter&#39;s safe return and for the festival to become a true celebration once more. The entire family joins aarti and they express their heartfelt wishes for Pakhi&#39;s return. Romil, however, leaves in the middle of the aarti.</p>

<p>Anupamaa notices Romil&#39;s absence and inquires about his whereabouts. Romil was in his room talking to one of his friends and asking them not to message or call him.<br />
Adhik approaches him and gives prasad. Adhik warns Romil that his involvement in Pakhi&#39;s kidnapping will soon become apparent to everyone, and he threatens dire consequences. Romil, his hand trembling, can only watch as Adhik walks away, leaving him in a state of fear and turmoil.</p>

<p>Romil tries to sneak out of the house. He notices Anupamaa in the kitchen and hides from her. However, Anupamaa sees his reflection in the window&#39;s mirror and keeps a close eye on him while he sneaks out. Anupamaa follows Romil and outside. Anupamaa, trailing Romil in an auto, struggles with her doubts. She reflects on Romil&#39;s lie about Pakhi leaving with Adhik and the trembling hands she observed earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Romil, unaware of Anupamaa&#39;s pursuit, is in a different auto on his way to a clandestine meeting with his friend. Romil arrives at his friend&#39;s house and Anupamaa continues to follow him, determined to uncover the truth behind Romil&#39;s actions.</p>

She is remembered widely for the iconic song <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/what-conditions-did-raveena-tandon-have-before-shooting-tip-tip-barsa-pani-with-akshay-kumar-actress-reveals-1223704">Tip Tip Barsa Paani</a> from one of the cult classic movies of the 90s,&nbsp;Mohra. She posed a challenge to the contestants of the show and danced to 90&#39;s iconic songs. Raveena spilled a lot of beans on the show about actors and actresses and also a fact about her song in the movie.</p>

<p>The actress revealed that during her days, many actors and actresses were running from one set to another doing two to three shifts. During her sequel in Mohra, the actress shared that song took two days to shoot and she caught a fever because of the rain.</p>

<h2><strong>Raveena suffered from fever and took tetanus shots</strong></h2>

<p>During her appearance on India&#39;s Best Dancer show, Raveena was questioned about her iconic Tip Tip Barsa Paani sequence, a memorable moment that was recently remixed in the Akshay Kumar starrer Suryavanshi.

In fact, the intensive shoot even caused her to develop a high fever, reaching a temperature of 102 degrees.</p>

<p>She said:&nbsp;&quot;I had to take tetanus injections, and two days later, I fell ill due to the exposure to rain. The glamour you see on screen conceals the untold stories behind the scenes. During rehearsals, injuries are commonplace, yet we all endure them. But the show must go on, whether on screen or stage; one&#39;s expressions and smile should never waver, regardless of the pain endured. These are the struggles that all artists and choreographers endure behind the scenes.&quot;</p>

Anupamaa stays at home with Barkha and Ankush. Meanwhile, Barkha, approaches Anupamaa, acknowledging that Anupamaa may not trust Adhik, but she insists that he is not capable of harming his own wife and doing something so drastic, even though he may have some shortcomings in his behavior. She pleads with Anupamaa to withdraw her complaint and promises that if Adhik is found guilty, she will break all ties with him. Anupamaa stays still and does not say anything.</p>

<p>Ankush says that he has known Adhik since childhood, and also vouches for Adhik&#39;s character in front of Anupamaa. Despite these pleas, Anupamaa is determined to find her daughter and she refuses to take back her complaint. Anupamaa asks Ankush to call Anuj, but he doesn&#39;t answer the call. Anupamaa starts worrying about Pakhi even more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, Barkha and Ankush decide to bring Anupamaa to the Shah house, realizing that she needs the support of her family in this difficult time. Anupamaa is emotionally distraught when she arrives at the Shah house, where she is comforted by Leela. She hugs Leela and breaks down in her arms, leaving everyone shocked. Leela tries to comfort Anupamaa, but everyone starts worrying seeing her crying like this.</p>

<p>Ankush explains to the Shah family that it was becoming increasingly challenging to handle Anupamaa. Everyone asks about Anuj&rsquo;s whereabouts when Ankush informs them that the Police have asked Anuj to visit the hospital as they have found a girl matching the Pakhi descriptions. Listening to this she vehemently asserts that the body discovered is not Pakhi, rejecting the notion.</p>

<p>Anuj finally arrives at the Shah house, confirming that the body found is not that of Pakhi. Anupamaa sighs in relief, however, the relief is short-lived as the inspector comes there. He informs them they have questioned Adhik and that Adhik confessed to raising his hand on his wife and admitted to involvement in fraudulent activities at Anuj&#39;s office but Adhik does not know anything about his wife&#39;s whereabouts. He has nothing to do with Pakhi&rsquo;s kidnapping.</p>

<p>Barkha, who had been defending Adhik&#39;s innocence, expresses her frustration and says that she was telling everyone about it but no one listened to her. Adhik arrives at the Shah house, confronting the family. Vanraj, Samar, and Toshu remain skeptical and accuse Adhik of manipulating the situation. Adhik pleads with Anupamaa to consider the possibility that he may have been a neglectful husband but asserts that he is not the kidnapper.</p>

<p>Romil, on the other hand, receives a phone call and learns that the situation is becoming complicated due to police involvement. His friend warns him about the risks involved if they get caught, hinting at a hidden truth.</p>

<p>Amidst the turmoil, Adhik urges the family to explore the possibility of another person being responsible for Pakhi&#39;s kidnapping. Barkha, Ankush, and Anuj also lend their support to this idea, highlighting the need for a broader perspective.</p>

<p>Adhik remembers everything he did to Pakhi and regrets his decisions. He blames himself and tries to punish himself by hitting his hand on the wall. Anupamaa arrives there and stops him. While still resentful of Adhik&#39;s actions towards her daughter, she agrees to consider other possibilities. She brings Adhik in front of everyone and asks everyone to listen to him once.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Romil is worried that if the police can find out the truth he will be in a lot of trouble. The family vows to find Pakhi at any cost and prays to Kanha Ji to keep his graceful eyes and handful of blessings on the Pakhi.</p>

She reveals that she didn&#39;t see Nidhi at the hospital that day and, even when she finally met her, she saw no scratches on her face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Srishti is worried that Preeta might not understand the seriousness of the matter and thinks that if Preeta visits the Luthra house, it will rekindle old wounds and fears. Srishti is keen to protect Preeta from the evil eyes of Nidhi.</p>

<p>Srishti tells Preeta that Gurpreet has made an appointment for Preeta at the doctor. Preeta tells her that she does not want to go to the doctor but wants to go to Luthra&#39;s and confront Nidhi for her actions. Srishti tells Preeta that if she goes to the doctor, she will take her to the Luthra house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kavya confides in Rajveer about the profound connection they seem to share. She muses that such deep bonds aren&#39;t easily formed and suggests that it might be a result of their past lives. Rajveer, however, says that he believes that their connection stems from their present life rather than any past life.</p>

<p>Later, at a clinic, Srishti devises a plan to prevent Preeta from visiting the Luthra house, fearing that it might lead to complications and emotional turmoil. Just as Srishti was thinking about this, Preeta interrupted Srishti and told her that she only came to the hospital because she had promised her that she would accompany her to the Luthra&rsquo;s. Preeta reiterates her intention to head to the Luthra house and confront Nidhi, citing the scratches on Nidhi&#39;s face as evidence of her claims.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nidhi plans to meet Shambhu to execute her plan to kill Preeta. She sneaks out of the house and goes to the marketplace where she is supposed to meet him to take her evil plan further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the hospital, Preeta and Srishti go to the nearby market which is the market Nidhi has headed to meet Shambhu. Preeta and Srishti are talking about Nidhi, just when Nidhi appears and sees them. She hides from them, meanwhile, Shambhu is drunk and tries to call Nidhi. Shambhu in his drunken state started shouting and saying something about Preeta, which revealed a shocking piece of information to the sisters. Shambhu said that Nidhi hired him to kill Preeta. The revelation leaves Preeta and Srishti in disbelief, unable to fathom Nidhi&#39;s sinister intentions.</p>

<p>Preeta becomes even more determined to confront Nidhi and uncover the reason behind her intense animosity. Despite Srishti&#39;s concerns, Preeta remains resolute in her quest for answers and is prepared to face her past head-on.</p>

Police arrive at the scene. Anuj talks with the DCP and reassures Anupamaa that no carelessness will be tolerated in Pakhi&#39;s case. Anupamaa can&#39;t help but worry about Pakhi&rsquo;s whereabouts and asks if someone kidnapped her daughter. Anuj asks Anupamaa not to think negatively and reminds her that Kanha ji is with them, assuring her that no harm will come to Pakhi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Adhik confronts Romil, demanding to know Pakhi&#39;s whereabouts. Adhik tries to get into a physical brawl with Romil, however, he accuses Adhik of being a criminal, not a victim, and warns him that no one will believe his claims. Adhik threatens to involve the police, but Romil counters by saying he will expose Adhik&#39;s abusive behavior, and then the police will take Adhik instead of him. Their argument escalates until Vanraj intervenes and grabs Adhik by his collar.</p>

<p>Vanraj comes to the Kapadia Mention with Toshu and Samar and demands answers about his daughter&#39;s disappearance. Barkha arrives on the scene and defends her brother, claiming that Adhik is innocent. Vanraj tells Adhik that if anything happens to Pakhi he will not spare him. Barkha tries to reason with him, stating that Adhik has nothing to do with this. She says that even Adhik is worried about Pakhi. Samar and Toshu believe it&#39;s a planned conspiracy.</p>

<p>Adhik swears on God and says that Pakhi might have left because of Anupamaa&#39;s interference in their married life. He says that Pakhi had warned Anupamaa numerous times that she should not interfere in her married life. The situation intensifies as the Inspector arrives, announcing Adhik&#39;s arrest as a suspect in Pakhi&#39;s disappearance. Barkha pleads for Adhik&#39;s innocence and asks who has filed a complaint against him. Anupamaa and Anuj arrive at the scene and say that Anupamaa has filed the complaint. She tells Adhik she tried every means to get the truth out of him but failed. Anupamaa refuses to withdraw the complaint, determined to find her daughter. Barkha asks Anupamaa to take the complaint back. Police intervene in between and ask Adhik to come to the police station with them. In the midst of the tension, Anupamaa suddenly faints, and Anuj rushes to her side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Leela asks Kinjal why Vanraj, Samar, and Toshu went to Anupamaa&#39;s house. Kinjal tells Leela that Samar has messaged her and told her that they will be home soon. Vanraj recalls Adhik&#39;s words about Pakhi&#39;s warning to Anupamaa, and Anupamaa regains consciousness, calling out for her daughter.</p>

<p>Anupamaa asks Anuj if Sweety is back, and he assures her she&#39;s on her way. Anupamaa, still worried about Pakhi, questions why her daughter left. Vanraj accuses Anupamaa and tells her that Pakhi left because of her interference. Anuj urges them to focus on finding Pakhi, and Anupamaa agrees but not before defending her actions.</p>

<p>Anupamaa admits she made a mistake by not taking action against Adhik earlier. She regrets not acting sooner and says that they often give their husbands and sons a chance, only to punish them later. She believes the torturous husband should be punished. Vanraj suggests that Pakhi may have left because of Anupamaa&#39;s constant interference.</p>

<p>Anupamaa challenges Vanraj&#39;s assumption, saying that teaching her daughter to fight for her self-respect is not interference. She questions whether mothers should silently suffer and suffocate. Vanraj clarifies that mothers can also make mistakes, and Anupamaa admits her mistake was not acting sooner against Adhik&#39;s abuse.</p>

<p>Anupamaa regrets not taking action sooner, knowing that her daughter suffered in silence. She says her daughter&#39;s patience may have reached its limit. Vanraj adds that it&#39;s Pakhi&#39;s life, and she shouldn&rsquo;t have interfered in between, especially when Pakhi asks her not to.</p>

<p>Anupamaa criticizes Vanraj for never handling the situation and always running away when Pakhi needs help. She said that he never tried to understand the situation and instead blamed her. Anupamaa defends herself, saying she was trying to help her daughter, but Vanraj never bothered to find out why Adhik accused her.</p>

<p>Vanraj says that even though he got angry because of what Adhik did, he never interfered in between Pakhi and Adhik as Pakhi wanted to give her husband a second chance. Anupamaa questioned Vanraj why he didn&#39;t invite Adhik for Raksha Bandhan when he knew Pakhi wouldn&#39;t come without him.</p>

Srishti reveals that Luthra&rsquo;s are behind everything and that Preeta has even forgotten that Rudraksh is her own son. She firmly believes that the Luthra family is responsible for Preeta&#39;s current state, asserting that they have caused her sister immense pain. Srishti goes on to explain that Preeta used to suffer from severe attacks triggered by the sound of drums. Overwhelmed by sorrow, she expresses her helplessness in the face of Preeta&#39;s condition. Just as the emotional exchange continues, Palki arrives there and informs Gurpreet that Shailendra is waiting for her outside.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rajveer calls Mohit and tells him what had happened at the Luthra&rsquo;s. He told Mohit that Kavya had been bitten by a snake. He reassures Mohit that he managed to extract the poison from Kavya&#39;s body, inadvertently exposing himself to it in the process. However, both Kavya and him are now out of danger. Mohit expresses his concern and asks Rajveer when he will return. Rajveer explains that he plans to be home by the evening because Kavya intends to tie a rakhi to him as well. Srishti overhears this conversation and goes inside to process the news.</p>

<p>Gurpreet tells Palki that she will come later. Palki sympathetically acknowledges that Srishti must be feeling upset about the situation.</p>

<p>Shaurya later comes down and joins the Luthra family, and he explains his reaction to Kavya&#39;s decision to tie rakhi on Rajveer&#39;s hand. He reveals that it hurt him because Kavya used to tie rakhi only on his hand. However, Nidhi told him and made him understand that his relationship with Kavya wouldn&#39;t change simply because of this gesture. Shaurya recalls Nidhi&#39;s advice to deceive the Luthra family and remove Rajveer from their lives.</p>

<p>As Kavya, Rajveer, and Shaurya sit down, Karan hugs Rajveer, expressing his remorse for making him feel wrong. Karan believes that he might have unintentionally done something to upset Rajveer and apologizes sincerely. Rajveer forgives Karan and warmly embraces him, signaling the mending of their strained relationship.</p>

<p>Kavya then took out the Rakhi box and showed it to Rajveer. Rajveer was happy seeing that the rakhi box had two Rakhis. Shaurya extends his hand, and Kavya proceeds to tie a rakhi to him. She also hands Kavya his card and asks her to buy whatever she desires as a Rakhi gift. Rajveer, feeling embarrassed said that he hadn&rsquo;t got any gift for Kavya as he thought that she would only tie Rakhi to Shaurya. But Kavya reassures him that his act of saving her life is the most significant gift she could receive. She proceeds to tie a Rakhi to Rajveer&#39;s hand. Rajveer then takes Kavya&rsquo;s blessings followed by a heartfelt hug.</p>

<p>Srishti is curious about how Preeta came to know about Kavya&#39;s snakebite incident and why she mentioned Rudraksh&#39;s name. Gurpreet explains that this is because Preeta is Rudraksh and Kavya&#39;s mother and a mother has a sixth sense when it comes to her children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Luthra ladies discuss their plans for celebrating Krishna Janmashtami, with Rakhi suggesting inviting Palki and Shanaya to join in the festivities.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Preeta tells Srishti that she remembers her attacker and reveals that her attacker is Nidhi. Preeta expresses her desire to confront Nidhi and understand why she attempted to kill her. She mentions that there may be scratches on Nidhi&#39;s face as evidence. Preeta decides to go to Luthra&#39;s house. She urges Srishti to accompany her to the Luthra house.</p>

Pakhi, expressing her reluctance, says that she will only come if her demand is fulfilled. Anupamaa, in her usual straightforward manner, tells Pakhi that she should only join the festivities if she genuinely wishes to do so. She emphasizes that Pakhi isn&#39;t&nbsp;doing anyone a favor by tying Rakhi to her brothers. Anupamaa goes on to point out that, for Pakhi, her family and the festival seem&nbsp;unimportant compared to her husband, implying that Pakhi should prioritize her family. Anupamaa says that if Pakhi does not want to come, she will go to the Shah&rsquo;s house herself with Anuj and Choti Anu.</p>

<p>Pakhi&#39;s decision to abstain from the celebration leaves her upset. She remembers her moments with her brothers and the bond that they&#39;ve shared and shed tears as well. In contrast, Anupamaa, along with Anuj and Choti Anu, proceeds over to the Shah house to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with the rest of the family.</p>

She reminds Kavya that their actions have been wrong and emphasizes that forgiveness if it comes, would be a testament to the family&#39;s greatness.

<p>On the other hand, Pakhi gets upset and starts listening to her brother&#39;s voice notes. Adhik asks her to go and celebrate Rakhi with her family. She says that she does not want to go. Adhik tells her that she should not keep him before her family. Pakhi agrees and informs Samar that she coming to the Shah&rsquo;s house for the Rakhi celebration. Samar excitedly informs the family that Pakhi is on her way. As Pakhi was about to leave from Kapadia Mention she received a call and she said that she would reach there. However, as time passes without her arrival, concern grows. Anuj suggests returning home to check on Pakhi&#39;s whereabouts. Vanraj advises them to call once they reach home.</p>

Romil says that he heard Adhik and Pakhi fighting before leaving upon which Adhik said that they were not fighting but Adhik was asking Pakhi to go to the Shah&rsquo;s house to tie Rakhi to her brothers.

The actresses who were best friends on the controversial reality show have been in the news after Archana unfollowed Priyanka on social media. Earlier, Archana refused to talk about her fight with Priyanka and had just mentioned being hurt by the latter&#39;s action. On the other hand, Priyanka called Archana&#39;s behavior childish and immature. Now, Archana has finally shared what happened between the two and why she is hurt.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Here&#39;s why Archana&#39;s friendship with Priyanka went kaput:</strong></h2>

<p>While talking to Siddharth Kannan on Jio Cinema Live chat, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/archana-gautam">Archana Gautam </a></strong>revealed the reason behind unfollowing Priyanka and cutting&nbsp;ties with her. When asked about unfollowing Priyanka, Archana shared, &quot;One-sided friendships never work. Even Salman sir had mentioned that if there is no respect in the bond then one shouldn&#39;t continue it. So I felt there is no use of maintaining the friendship as I am giving my 100% and I am not getting 100% from her. Inside the Bigg Boss house, Priyanka and I had fights but everything used to get resolved. In Bigg Boss, I was interested in politics. Now that I have come out of the Bigg Boss house my focus from politics has shifted to acting after listening to everyone&#39;s opinion. I want to do TV shows, web series and music videos. So it feels that Priyanka is feeling that competition due to which she has changed.&quot;</p>

<p>Archana also opened up about what happened at (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/priyanka-chahar-choudhary">Priyanka Chahar Choudhary</a></strong>) Priyanka&#39;s birthday bash and mentioned how she made efforts on the latter&#39;s special day. Firstly, Archana said, &quot;On her birthday I filled my whole Instagram handle with her pictures. She called me at midnight 1 am I went to her house with gifts to party because she called me and I give my 100% in friendship. She then called me in Karjat for her birthday celebration and I denied going along with her friends. I thought I might be a disturbance among her friends. She still insisted me to come and so I went. I drove for 5 hours to Karjat and also picked Rajiv (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/rajiv-adatia">Rajiv Adatia</a></strong>), his brother, and his friend in my car. When I reached there, for formality she said hi and then when I went in the pool, she got out, she didn&#39;t let me take a video for her birthday and she ran away. She did it consciously that if I uploaded a story, she would have to repost it.&quot;</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/khatron-ke-khiladi-13-promo-aishwarya-sharma-calls-abdu-rozik-very-chalak-latters-reply-will-crack-you-up-1240900">Khatron Ke Khiladi 13</a></strong>&nbsp;contestant explained how Priyanka didn&#39;t even bother wishing her on her birthday and later didn&#39;t turn up for her party despite inviting her personally. She said, &quot;On my birthday, she didn&#39;t even post a story and to show people that she is good, she used her fake account and posted by birthday story on that and then reposted that story on her story. She didn&#39;t even tag me. She could have reshared my solo photo and wished me. I just want a little love and I don&#39;t need fame. I am more famous than her and I have done more work like Khatron Ke Khiladi and Entertainment Ki Raat-Housefull and in future too I will work.&quot;</p>

<p>Archana continued, &quot;She didn&#39;t share a story I still didn&#39;t feel bad about it. When I called, she didn&#39;t answer. When she called back, she wished me and I told her that I was throwing a party. She asked me who was coming I told her and she said that she would come for the party in the evening. She didn&#39;t even turn up, I had added her name to my media invite.&quot;</p>

<p>Archana elaborated how her friend Soundarya Sharma wished her and when she invited her to the party, Soundarya informed her that she wouldn&#39;t be able to come as she is out of India. Archana called out Priyanka for maintaining fake friendships in <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/mc-stan-to-shalin-bhanot-find-out-what-bigg-boss-16-finalists-are-doing-right-now-1212433">Bigg Boss 16 </a></strong>house.&nbsp;</p>

He catapulted to stardom as the first runner-up of <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-ott-fame-abhishek-malhan-is-starstruck-as-he-meets-the-legend-hint-his-name-starts-with-yo-1240849">Bigg Boss OTT Season 2</a></strong>. Throughout the show, his unwavering commitment and consistent progress were apparent right from the outset. Abhishek&#39;s journey on Bigg Boss OTT 2 garnered significant attention due to his candid opinions and unique perspectives. In Dimple Malhan&rsquo;s recent vlog, Abhishek gives a hint that he is contemplating buying a supercar.</p>

<h2><strong>Fukra Insaan hints at buying a supercar:</strong></h2>

<p>In a recent vlog, prominent YouTuber <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/abhishek-malhan">Abhishek Malhan</a></strong> visited a car showroom with his friend. He showed two impressive supercars, the Mustang, and the Porsche Panamera. Unfortunately, the car Abhishek desired was unavailable at that moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He decided to take a test drive in a Porsche Panamera. Before going for the test drive, Abhishek hinted at his preferred car, playfully engaging his fans by saying, &ldquo;Meko jo gaadi chahiye wo abhi inke pass nahi hai but available krenge wo gaadi. Guess karo konsi gaadi hai. Ek hai alag si, &lsquo;A&rsquo; se naam chalu ho sakta hai uska. (The car I want is not currently with them, but they will make it available. Guess which car it is. It&#39;s unique, and its name might start with the letter &#39;A&#39;.)&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>Watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AjfVmLCUd0">here</a>.</strong></h3>

<p>During his test drive of the Porsche Panamera, Malhan expressed his thoughts about the car, saying, &ldquo;It is a nice car bhai. Though mujhe iske features jada pata nahi hai. Bhai iska panel itna pyara bana rakha hai. Matlab jo gaadi m lene aaya tha, matlab jo mai soch raha tha ki meko yeh leni chahiye wo bhaut hi pyaari hai, par isko chlane k baad I can consider this. (It is a nice car. Although I don&#39;t know much about its features. The panel is beautifully designed. I came here with the intention of buying a different car, the one I was thinking of is really a nice car. But After driving it, I can consider this.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>After coming back home, Abhishek excitedly informed his father about a new car he had seen for the family. However, he kept the specific car model a secret, leaving his fans and viewers curious about which supercar might soon join the Malhan family.</p>

<p>For the unversed, Abhishek Malhan secured the position of the first runner-up on the Salman Khan-hosted Bigg Boss OTT 2, with <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/elvish-yadav">Elvish Yadav</a></strong> emerging as the winner. Malhan is all set to release his upcoming album Judaiyaan with Jiya Shankar on&nbsp;September 8.&nbsp;<br />

So I think, I have experienced this intimidation from my people. Not my relatives or friends but sometimes with people you&#39;re working with, like co-actors. Because they just know a part of me, not like fans, who have seen me since childhood. They grew up with me, so they know my journey. Sometimes the people who meet me, see just this certain side of me, which is a certain somebody with certain followers certain fame, or whatever. So they&#39;ll judge you by that, they don&#39;t know my journey. So you have to see what&#39;s behind it, you have to know me as a person, and then you get to judge me so that I see sometimes people get intimidated by me. I am like, &#39;Don&#39;t get intimidated by me, sit with me, talk to me, and get to know my story, maybe you&#39;ll be my friend or something.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/siddharth-nigam">Siddharth Nigam</a></strong> said, &quot;I have stopped taking stress about all this. Now whenever I enter anywhere, I enter with the thought that I am the best and I don&#39;t care about the rest. Sometimes people don&#39;t know you. I don&#39;t you and whatever you&#39;ll do maybe I&#39;ll judge you with that. But if I know your story that from where you have come, how much you have hustled, how much hard work you have done, how much have you studied so if you know that journey, you&#39;ll respect that person. Even all the popular content creators from social media, I respect them too because God gives an opportunity to a person and you just have to use that opportunity if you are capable of using that opportunity then you&#39;re the best and you&#39;re doing good with yourself so I&#39;ll respect everybody and I love everybody who is doing good and who are very respectful, who understand work and value people.&quot;</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/kisi-ka-bhai-kisi-ki-jaan">Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan</a></strong> actor continued, &quot;So, people who do these things, I like them. People who gain a fan following and become a star overnight, start behaving differently and then they don&#39;t treat other people nicely, and they don&#39;t treat their seniors nicely, there I feel bad. I maintain my distance from such people because I have lived in a hostel and I have always seen and learned respect. If somebody is like two months older than me, I have to call him sir or brother. It doesn&#39;t happen in the industry but sometimes I call people with such names and then they&#39;ll be like don&#39;t call me this call me by my name. So I think respect is very important.&quot;</p>

The quiz-based reality show recently witnessed history as contestant <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/kaun-banega-crorepati-15-seasons-first-crorepati-jaskaran-fails-to-crack-7-crore-question-can-you-guess-1241374">Jaskaran Singh</a></strong>, who hails from Punjab, emerged as the first crorepati of the season. Jaskaran, who is currently preparing for his first attempt at the civil service exams, recently won Rs. 1 crore on Kaun Banega Crorepati 15. Recently, in an exclusive telephonic&nbsp;conversation with Pinkvilla, Kaun Banega Crorepati 15&#39;s first crorepati Jaskaran Singh shared&nbsp;his experience of emerging as the first crorepati.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Excerpts from the interview:</em></strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Were you at any point nervous in front of host Mr. Amitabh Bachchan?</strong></h3>

<p>I think the way Bachchan sir treats contestants and talks to them, be it me or anyone else, I don&#39;t think he must be making anyone feel anyone nervous. Questions are different, but sitting before Bachchan sir didn&#39;t make me feel nervous at all&nbsp;and that is his greatness.</p>

<h3><strong>Did Amitabh Bachchan give you any piece of advice backstage? Did you have the chance to converse with him?</strong></h3>

<p>After the game finished, I went backstage to click a picture with <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/amitabh-bachchan">Mr. Amitabh Bachchan</a></strong>, and there we spoke, and sir told me, &#39;I played well, and I should keep doing well.&#39;</p>

<h3><strong>You come from a very humble background, what is it that you want to do with the winning amount?</strong></h3>

<p>As I said on TV, my main priority is my family and my house. So obviously, the amount that I won on Kaun Banega Crorepati 15, I will utilize for my family and house.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Did you speak to your parents and what did they say after you won this huge sum of prize money?</strong></h3>

<p>My family got very emotional when Amitabh Bachchan sir himself announced that I had won Rs. 1 crore. My family was very emotional and they were extremely happy. They were even video-calling Bachchan sir and it was a huge moment for all of us.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>How would you describe your journey from a boy who traveled 4 hours to go to college to now becoming a renowned name nationally?</strong></h3>

<p>For me, reaching KBC&#39;s hot seat has been a long journey. From imagining winning this huge amount and meeting Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and sitting in front of him, I am now living this moment and this life. So, it has been a life-changing experience.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>If you had to share the credits of your achievement with someone, who would they be?</strong></h3>

She tells him that she senses a reflection of Nidhi&#39;s behavior in him. Kareena blames&nbsp;Shaurya&#39;s upbringing for his self-centred nature and implores&nbsp;him to reflect on the concepts of right and wrong. She chastises&nbsp;Nidhi for contributing to Shaurya&#39;s negative traits and suggests that Nidhi should thank Rajveer for saving Kavya&#39;s life. Kritika also joins&nbsp;in the admonition of Nidhi&#39;s actions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the doctor delivers&nbsp;the heartening news that Rajveer and Kavya are out of danger. He commends&nbsp;Rajveer for his swift action in saving Kavya&#39;s life and advises Karan to call the snake charmer as soon as they can to locate the snake as it is a very dangerous and poisonous snake. Rishabh takes the anti-venom from the doctor as a precautionary measure and expresses gratitude to the doctor.</p>

<p>Rajveer and Kavya regain&nbsp;consciousness. Kavya tries to get up from the bed as she wants to complete the Rakhi ritual and wants to tie Rakhi to her brothers. Rakhi asks Kavya to rest for a bit longer as she is concerned for her well-being, but Bani supports Kavya&#39;s decision. Rajveer expresses&nbsp;his intention to return home, stating that his family is awaiting&nbsp;his return.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kavya, however, stops&nbsp;him and asks him if he would not allow her to tie a Rakhi on him, reasoning that he had already fulfilled his promise to protect her. This unexpected bond between Kavya and Rajveer leaves Shaurya bewildered, who appears discontented with the situation.</p>

<p>Kavya explains that she and Rajveer had&nbsp;chosen this unique relationship, one that seemed to transcend traditional boundaries. This moment of understanding and connection between Kavya and Rajveer is met with Shaurya&#39;s disapproval. Shaurya says that if Kavya ties Rakhi to Rajveer he will not celebrate Rakhi. Karan, already incensed with Shaurya, admonishes&nbsp;him for his behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajveer tells Kavya that she only has one Rakhi so he will go and buy one more. Kavya stops him and tells him that she has two brothers so she has two Rakhi. Listening to this, Shaurya&#39;s hasty exit from the hall. Karan asks Kavya to tie Rakhi only to Rajveer. Rajveer says that Shaurya does not have any respect for any relationship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Srishti and Gurpreet are watching Preeta while she is drinking water. Preeta realises this and confronts them. Srishti says that they were just looking, but deep inside she is relieved that Preeta does not remember anything. Preeta tells them that she is not feeling well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, Rajveer asks Karan why he asks Kavya to tie rakhi only to him as Shaurya is her real brother. Karan says that Rajveer has fulfilled all his duties of protecting Kavya and thus he deserves it. Rajveer says that he values relationships the most, Karan says that he values human beings the most and Rishabh says that family matters to him the most. Mahesh praises Rishabh&#39;s wisdom, and the family playfully teases Karan for his arrogance.</p>

<p>However, tensions escalate&nbsp;as Shaurya grapples&nbsp;with Kavya&#39;s apparent admiration for Rajveer. He confronts&nbsp;Nidhi about her previous statements regarding Rajveer potentially being affected by the poison, which unintentionally elevated&nbsp;Rajveer&#39;s status in the family. Nidhi explains&nbsp;her strategy of making an enemy into a friend by manipulating emotions. She advises Shaurya to adopt a more calculated approach to avoid losing his place in the family to Rajveer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Srishti tells Gurpreet that Preeta may remember her past. Gurpreet is happy to hear this but Srishti says that it&#39;s not good news. She decides to tell Gurpreet the truth. Gurpreet is shocked to learn that Karan is Preeta&rsquo;s husband. Srishti tells her about Preeta&rsquo;s accident and expresses her concern.&nbsp;</p>

Anuj receives Hansmukh&#39;s invitation to celebrate Rakhi. However, Hansmukh specifies&nbsp;that only Anuj, Anupamaa, Pakhi, Choti Anu, and Romil were welcome, but not Adhik. Anuj senses&nbsp;that something significant might unfold the next day. Anupamaa is wondering if Pakhi would go to the Shah&rsquo;s house without Adhik.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Leela asks Dimpy to remove the line she has drawn in the kitchen as it is Rakshabandha today. Dimpy, feeling excluded due to her brother&#39;s (Adhik) banishment from the house, expresses her frustration and tells Leela that she will not remove this line. Kinjal and Kavya enter the kitchen and Leela asks Kavya not to touch anything as she does not want her to be a part of anything. Kavya, overhearing their conversation, laments about&nbsp;her fall from grace as the bahu (daughter-in-law) of the house just a day prior. Kinjal, determined to take the high road, refrains&nbsp;from using harsh words like Leela and reminds Kavya that she hasn&#39;t forgiven Toshu, so Leela&#39;s forgiveness shouldn&#39;t be expected either. Kinjal encourages&nbsp;Kavya to make prasad if she wishes to, vowing to handle Leela. Kavya worries that Leela would be angry, to which Kinjal retorts&nbsp;that if Toshu could participate in the puja, Kavya could too.</p>

<p>Anuj, all dressed up for the festivities, is met with Anupamaa&#39;s gaze. Anuj teases&nbsp;her for not realizing the impact of her actions as her presence alone has&nbsp;already quickened his heartbeat. He then adorns&nbsp;her with a necklace and a gajra, causing Anupamaa to blush. Their tender moment is interrupted by Choti Anu&#39;s arrival. Anupamaa lovingly holds her in her lap and inquires&nbsp;about her sadness. Choti Anu reveals&nbsp;her dilemma: Adhik is her Jiju (brother-in-law), but Romil feels like a brother, and she wishes to tie him a Rakhi. However, she fears that Romil might get angry. They all pray&nbsp;for a harmonious celebration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Samar busily wraps gifts for Pakhi and Choti Anu, but Dimpy scolds him for what she perceives as wasteful spending. Toshu intervenes, explaining that the gifts are from both of them. Dimpy, unconvinced, accuses Toshu of claiming credit for Samar&#39;s gifts. Vanraj intervenes, emphasizing the sanctity of sibling bonds and reminding them of the importance of unity.</p>

<p>Barkha lovingly ties Rakhi to Adhik, disregarding what others might say, affirming their bond as brother and sister. Pakhi beams&nbsp;with joy as she witnesses the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choti Anu notices&nbsp;Barkha tying Rakhi without them and feels&nbsp;left out. Anupamaa assures her that it is okay, as she would tie Rakhi to her brother first. Adhik and Barkha share&nbsp;an affectionate hug, and she blesses&nbsp;him. Adhik, regretfully says that he has no gift to give her as he has no money and no job. Barkha insists&nbsp;that she doesn&#39;t need anything. However, Pakhi surprises&nbsp;Barkha with a necklace as a Rakhi gift from her and Adhik&rsquo;s end, leaving both Adhik and Barkha stunned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adhik says that he cannot&nbsp;take the gift as it was gifted to Pakhi from Anupamaa and Anuj as a wedding present. Barkha also plays&nbsp;along but eventually accepts the gift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The brawl between the family escalates, and Pakhi defends&nbsp;her husband, affirming his changed nature. Romil enters&nbsp;the hall, and Choti Anu musters&nbsp;the courage to ask if she could tie him a Rakhi. Initially hesitant, Romil agrees&nbsp;upon Ankush&#39;s suggestion, prompting a warm embrace as Choti Anu ties the Rakhi. Anupamaa eloquently explained the significance of Rakhi, emphasizing the bond of protection brothers offer their sisters and the guidance sisters provide their brothers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choti Anu asks&nbsp;Romil for a Rakhi gift who regretfully confesses that he has nothing to offer at the moment. She hugs&nbsp;him and says that he could just hug her and playfully requests for an ice cream later. Romil feels loved and deeply moved by this gesture. Anupamaa asks Pakhi to tie Rakhi to Romil as she treats him like the younger brother. She initially denies saying that she would not do anything that her husband doesn&#39;t like. Anupamaa suggests&nbsp;that they all should head to Shah&#39;s house for the festival. Anupamaa asks Pakhi to come along. Pakhi agrees, leaving Adhik in shock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Pakhi places&nbsp;a shocking condition before Anupamaa. She asks Anupamaa to give Adhik one more chance. She places a condition that she will only go to Shah&#39;s house if Anupamaa takes Adhik back on the project. Anupamaa questions&nbsp;Pakhi&#39;s maturity and emphasizes&nbsp;the value of her work, highlighting that it is not as trivial as giving someone chocolate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pakhi, indignant, argues&nbsp;that her condition is reasonable. She says that if Anupamaa is not ready to accept her condition she will not go to Shah&#39;s house to tie Rakhi to her brother and compares it to clapping with both hands, insisting that Anupamaa agree to her terms.</p>

The two have been usually spotted at many parties having great fun together. However, Archana unfollowing Choudhary on her Instagram proved that all is not well between the two. Priyanka recently broke her silence about her fight with Gautam, saying that she found his behavior to be extremely immature and childish.</p>

<h2><strong>Priyanka Chahar Choudhary opens up on her fight with Archana Gautam</strong></h2>

<p>In a recent interview with the Times of India, Priyanka Chahar Choudhary was asked about her friendship with Archana Gautam going kaput and she responded by calling the latter&rsquo;s antics childish and idiotic. The Bigg Boss 16 2nd-runner-up spoke up, &ldquo;Woh na ek bacchi hai aur ab main na inn Bachkaani harkaton pe kya hi bolun (She is a kid and what should I even say on this immature and childish behavior). It is actually fine and no comments.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For the unversed, recently Gautam had thrown a grand birthday bash where she had invited all of her close friends. There were some who couldn&rsquo;t make it to the celebrations but extended wishes, messages and even gifted the birthday girl on her special day. However, the Udaariyaan fame actress was not only missing from the birthday party but also did not bother to inform the reason to not attending the party which hurt Gautam a lot. Thus she decided to cut off all ties with the Udaariyan fame actress and even unfollowed her on Instagram. Even the<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/show-chhodke-chale-jao-khatron-ke-khiladi-13s-host-rohit-shetty-gets-angry-at-archana-gautam-watch-1240343"> Khatron Ke Khiladi season 13</a> contestants&rsquo; close friends went on to reveal how the former has always appreciated Choudhary&rsquo;s work and achievements. The Silbatta Queen even drove late at night to attend Choudhary&rsquo;s birthday party which was actually a last moment plan when these two girls were seen having fun together.</p>

<p>During their stint in Bigg Boss Season 16, the two girls ended up becoming close friends, especially the way Gautam had supported Priyanka in the captaincy tasks. The two were at loggerheads at many times due to a clash of opinions but they always recognised each other as true friends. Post Bigg Boss 16, they even partied together at every occasion related to the show.&nbsp;</p>

They told me that when they saw my personality on Bigg Boss, they thought I could be quite dominating, like someone who can control others. They said a lot of things.

(And when I posted a poll on Twitter, people started asking if I had received an offer for Lock Upp. So, let me clarify, I haven&#39;t received an offer to host Lock Upp. I&#39;ve been offered a different show, which is set to premiere its first season in India. It&#39;s a completely unique concept, and I can&#39;t disclose details, but if the commercials align and it feels like the right move, I might just say yes. Because right now, I&#39;m inclined towards it, and I will do it.)&rdquo;</p>

Adhik takes a moment to confront Romil, warning him that he narrowly avoided jail this time, but there&#39;s no guarantee he won&#39;t end up there soon. Romil is deeply hurt by the false accusation and feels denigrated. Pakhi also leaves the hall in distress. Romil, feeling dejected, sits on the sofa, reflecting on Ankush&#39;s advice to accept and apologize if he made a mistake. He insists he&#39;s innocent and never stole anything.</p>

<p>Anupamaa enters the hall and sees Romil sitting there all alone. Feeling bad for him, she goes and consoles Romil, offering comfort and support. She places a warm bag on his cheeks, soothing the pain from Ankush&#39;s slap. Anupamaa tells him that she knows the truth and that he hasn&rsquo;t stolen any money. Romil is surprised and asks how she knew the truth. Anupamaa explains that a mother is the ultimate lie detector and can determine the truth, big or small. She recounts her experience raising her three children, knowing who broke a glass and lied about it or who ate Sweety&#39;s ice cream when they were young. Romil is moved by her trust in him. He never felt this much love before as no one showed trust in him.</p>

<p>Anupamaa is in the kitchen and recalls Adhik&#39;s attempt to prevent her from involving the police for the sake of the family&#39;s reputation. Adhik enters the kitchen and Anupamaa questions Adhik&#39;s motives. She points out that he knew there was no one at home when he took the money, to which Adhik argues he was informed by Barkha. She informed him that she already knew that he was the one who tried to frame Romil for stealing money. Anupamaa counters that Barkha didn&#39;t mention the money was found in the cabinet. She accuses Adhik of feigning to be clever and warns that his deception cannot escape a mother&#39;s keen eye. Pakhi interjects, berating Anupamaa for meddling in her married life and defending her husband. She threatens to take drastic actions if Anupamaa doesn&#39;t stop interfering. Anupamaa asks her to shut up but Pakhi leaves the kitchen.</p>

<p>Adhik and Anupamaa are left alone in the kitchen again. He expressed his concern to Anupamaa over Pakhi&#39;s anger. Anupamaa asserts her authority as Sweety&#39;s mother and vows to protect Pakhi from any harm. She warns Adhik that she&#39;s fully aware of his actions and isn&#39;t blind like Pakhi. The game has just begun, and Anupamaa is ready to turn the tables.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, preparations for Raksha Bandhan are underway in the Shah family. Leela urges Kinjal to wake up early, and Toshu asks whether Pakhi will be coming. Leela tells him that Pakhi will come once Leela calls her. Dimpy comes and asks if Adhik will also come as she will tie Rakhi to him. Vanraj intervenes, implying that Dimpy should have scolded Adhik for his actions. Vanraj asks Dimpy to go to the Kapadia Mention if she wants to tie Rakhi to Adhik.</p>

<p>Anupamaa quietly steps into the room to find Anuj, who has dozed off while sitting in a chair. She begins tidying up the scattered files on the table, and Anuj stirs awake from his impromptu nap. As they both settle in, their conversation shifts towards Romil&#39;s predicament. Anuj contemplates the situation and proposes a potential solution, suggesting that they relocate Romil to a hostel given Pakhi&#39;s unwillingness to heed Adhik&#39;s actions. Anupamaa, however, unveils a startling revelation &ndash; she firmly believes in Romil&#39;s innocence and asserts that Adhik had framed him by planting the money in his room. Anuj is left utterly astonished by this unexpected twist in the story.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/happy-birthday-jasmin-bhasin-girl-next-door-to-stunning-diva-check-out-naagin-actress-transformation-1227628">Naagin 4</a></strong> continued, &quot;So I never understood that concept and at that time I was very tense. It made me depressed for the first time in my life. But then I realised that these people don&#39;t have any identity for sending me rape threats and calling me words that I never heard in my entire life. Nameless people who do not even have b*lls or strong spine come and show their identity and say, &#39;Oh I have commented, I don&#39;t like you.&#39; If they have guts, they should openly say it.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking about her personal life, Jasmine Bhasin fell in love with actor <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/aly-goni">Aly Goni</a></strong>&nbsp;during her stint in Bigg Boss 14. Ever since&nbsp;the two made their relationship public, fans have been going gaga about the couple. The couple&#39;s fans adorably call them as &#39;Jasly&#39; and the duo never shies away from expressing their love for each other.&nbsp;</p>

Rishabh arrives and finds that the women, including Rakhi, Bani, and Kareena, are already present. He asks them about everyone else and playfully teases them by saying that men can never come on time. Rajveer also arrives and greets everyone. Rishabh urges that he is like a family member and should be considered as part of the Luthra family. Rishabh says that Rajveer will take the Luthra family ahead. Listening to this, Bani starts laughing while Rajveer is confused to hear something like this. Rakhi on the other hand asks Rishabh to consider before speaking.</p>

<p>When Shaurya arrives, he dismisses the idea of anyone other than blood relatives being considered Luthra heirs. Rajveer humbly states that he has no desire to become a Luthra, but Rishabh defends him, reasoning that Rajveer is indeed part of their family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karan arrives and tells Shaurya that Rajveer is right and no one would like to change their surname to become something they are not. Shaurya asks him not to defend Rajveer every time. This difference of opinion leads to a tense moment between Shaurya and Karan. Karan tells him that he has no intention of arguing with Shaurya on the day of this auspicious festival. Shaurya left from there.</p>

<p>Kritika comes home and meets everyone. Rajveer greets her by touching her feet. Karan asks Rajveer to come with him and help him with some work, but Kritika insists that Karan should stay and do any other work after she ties him the sacred thread. She playfully demands a gift from him before allowing him to continue with his work.</p>

<p>Karan asks Rajveer to bring the files to the study as he does not want to disappoint Kritika. Meanwhile, Nidhi is planning a cunning way to kill Preeta. She has hired a snake charmer and asks him to be discreet about his presence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajveer sees Kavya preparing a Rakhi plate, and he feels an emotional thinking that expresses his desire to experience the feeling of Raksha Bandhan. He thinks that Kavya might also tie Rakhi to him but he sees Kavya is keeping only one Rakhi for Shaurya, which disappoints Rajveer as he had hoped she would tie one for him as well. However, he appreciates her gesture of considering him as her brother and does not express any complaints.</p>

<p>The episode takes a mysterious turn when Nidhi instructs the snake charmer to bring a dangerous snake. As the snake charmer is talking to Nidhi, he tells her that the snake he has brought is very dangerous and poisonous, and if the snake bites someone that person will surely die. She seems pleased with the sinister idea. However, the snake escaped from the box. Nidhi jumps to bed and asks the snake charmer to find the snake as soon as possible because her entire family is waiting in the hall. She is worried that the snake may bite someone in the family.</p>

<p>Kavya sees Nidhi standing on the bed and asks her about it. Nidhi asks Kavya not to entire her room and that she is very happy and just enjoying the festival by jumping on the bed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the family members continue with their Raksha Bandhan celebrations, Shaurya expresses his dislike for Rajveer to Rakhi, who he believes is being favored by his family. Rakhi attempts to change Shaurya&#39;s perspective and suggests that he should not harbor hatred. However, Shaurya remains firm in his negative opinion of Rajveer.</p>

<p>As the episode concludes, the family gathers for the Rakhi rituals, with Kareena, Mahesh, and others participating in the celebration. Kareen asks Bani to tell them the story of Rakshabandh. She tells the story of Krishan Ji and Dropati and their pure sibling bond. Rajveer is upset to think that Kavya will not tie Rakhi to him and he wants to leave from there; however, Rakhi stops him from leaving.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rishabh gifts a smartwatch to Kritika. Kareena and Mahesh begin the Rakhi rituals. She ties him the Rakhi. Kritika tied Rakhi to Karan and Rishabh. Kavya ties Rakhi to Shaurya. Rajveer again gets emotional seeing this but soon remembers his promise to Kavya.<br />

He indirectly took a jibe at Salman Khan for being biased towards Pooja Bhatt and even accused the makers of portraying him in a negative light in the last week of the Salman Khan-led show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, in the Q&amp;A session, one fan asked Abhishek, &quot;Will you participate in Bigg Boss 17, we want to see you.&quot; Answering this question, Abhishek shared, &quot;Even I want you to see me but not in <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-17-will-udaariyaan-actor-abhishek-kumar-be-part-of-salman-khan-hosted-show-1240494">Bigg Boss 17</a></strong>. I feel Bigg Boss OTT 2 has given me a lot. I like creating YouTube videos for you and making crazy content for you. I want to do a little social work, I want to make songs so I want to do that for now. I want to do hosting, I want to do little acting and a lot of other things so now I am focusing on that.&quot;</p>

<p>He further shared, &quot;Now that I have not won OTT so I have a chance to go in the Bigg Boss season. So in future definitely you will see me there in Bigg Boss 18 or Bigg Boss 19 maybe.&quot;</p>

He expresses his love to her but also tells Kavya that he might never accept the baby. Even though he loved her, he could not forgive her for whatever she had done, and he needed some time to deal with the recent events. He didn&#39;t want to make hasty decisions based on others&#39; opinions. Kavya asked Vanraj if he wanted her to leave the Shah house, to which Vanraj said maybe. Kavya understood his dilemma and agreed to give him the space he needed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the Kapadia Mention, everyone in the family was still reeling from the shock of the missing money, and Romil was under suspicion. Adhik started blaming Romil for stealing the money and urged everyone to search his room. Anupamaa tells Romil that no one is suspecting him but they just want to find the money so everyone should look for it. Romil offered to have his room searched, confident that nothing would be found. Tensions ran high as accusations flew between family members.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kavya, feeling isolated and troubled by her actions, sought solace from Hasmukh. She walked towards him crying and asked him if he could talk to her. Taking the situation under control, Hasmukh asked her to sit and stop crying. He advised her to reflect on her mistakes. He tells her that they cannot forget what she has done, but what is done is done and if she does not want to leave the house she can stay. Listening to all this Leela was furious with Kavya and wanted nothing to do with her. She asked her to never show her face again and to stay in her room or else she would not even wait for Vanraj to rethink his decision. She left, leaving Kavya feeling abandoned and regretful. Kavya turned to Kinjal for support. Kinjal asks her to sit and is reminded that she has brought her troubles upon herself. She tells her that what she did to Vanraj is the exact thing Toshu did to her. Kinjal prompted her to apologize sincerely but not to anticipate forgiveness in return.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the search for the missing money continued, and doubts and suspicions swirled among the family members. Adhik and Romil clashed over the search. Adhik wanted to search Romil&rsquo;s room personally but Romil disagreed leading to a brawl between both. Pakhi intervenes and asks Romil if she can search his room. Romil agreed but went ahead to search Adhik&rsquo;s room. Pakhi finds a money bag hidden in Romil&rsquo;s cupboard. Romil accuses Adhik and his sisters of trying to frame him and even blames Pakhi&#39;s involvement in this. The situation escalated as tempers flared, and Romil made serious allegations against Adhik and Pakhi.</p>

<p>Ankush couldn&#39;t tolerate the accusations and slapped Romil, requiring the truth. Romil vehemently repudiated stealing the money and even suggested going to jail if that&#39;s what it took to prove his innocence. Anupamaa tells everyone that they need not call the police and should end the matter then and there. Barkha opposes and says if Adhik had stolen the money Anupamaa would have sent him to jail. Upon this, Anupamaa said that she would call the police, and then their investigation would lead to the truth. Barkha and Adhik get scared of the truth and Adhik says that they should not punish Romil for this. Anupamaa doubts Adhik and Barkha.&nbsp;</p>

She tells him that it will tarnish his and this family&#39;s entire reputation. Vanraj says that it is the unpredictable nature of the world to accuse and blame everyone and that he also previously cheated without facing a bad reputation.</p>

<p>He recalls Anupamaa&#39;s advice about seeing things clearly when the heart is calm and states that just as little Anu is the daughter of Anupamaa and Anuj, this baby belongs to Kavya and him.</p>

<p>Leela objects, believing that some great personality&#39;s spirit has taken over Vanraj. She warns him and tells him that he will regret it. She asks if he will accept Anirudh&#39;s baby, to which Vanraj reluctantly agrees, reiterating that Kavya is his wife and the baby is his. The family is shocked by his firm decision. Leela cannot believe it and starts crying.</p>

<p>Vanraj walks towards Kavya. She looks emotionally at Vanraj as he reaches out to hold her hand. Anupamaa intervenes just as Kavya is about to accept his hand, raising questions about Vanraj&#39;s true commitment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anupamaa suggests that Vanraj should carefully reconsider his decision and its lifelong implications before proceeding. She says that forgiveness doesn&#39;t come naturally to him and questions whether he will stand by his choice. She tells him that he may forgive and accept the baby today but what if he regrets it in the future?&nbsp;<br />
After hearing all this, Vanraj walks away. Anupamaa tells Kavya that she is not trying to keep evil eyes on her happiness. Anupamaa explains that she wanted him to make a clear, unwavering decision so that he wouldn&#39;t change his mind later. She says how Vanraj&#39;s happiness and decisions shifted with changing circumstances and emotions, emphasizing that a lifelong commitment should be deeply considered. Kavya agrees with Anupamaa&#39;s perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dimpy and Samar walk back into their room. Dimpy says that everyone blames her that she is bad but in actuality, the real culprits and dramas are Vanraj and his wife. She found entertainment in the household&#39;s theatrics. She also said that now that the family has this much drama, she does not need to pay for any OTT subscriptions. Samar tells Dimpy that he is going to teach dance to a rich businessman&rsquo;s son. Dimpy teases him, and they banter before Samar leaves.</p>

<p>The family awaits Vanraj&#39;s decision with anxiety, while Kavya and Anupamaa engage in a tense exchange. Anuj discusses Kavya&#39;s decision to confront Vanraj. Anupamaa tells him sorry and that she wasn&rsquo;t available today. She asked him if Pakhi created any drama regarding Adhik. Anuj tells her everything and they pray for the truth about Adhik to come to light soon. She prays for solutions to the family&#39;s problems, one at a time.</p>

<p>Anuj receives a shocking phone call that leaves him deeply troubled. Ankush arrives at home. Anuj asks him if he has deposited the cash but Ankush apologizes for forgetting to deposit a cash briefcase and important documents in the bank. Anuj is furious and berates him for the oversight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kavya presses Vanraj for his decision. Vanraj tells her that he cannot accept Anirudh&rsquo;s baby.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ankush cannot find the briefcase and asks Barkha if she has seen it. Barkha denies. Ankush faces the family&#39;s anger over the missing money, and tensions rise as accusations are thrown around. Adhik accuses Romil, and the situation becomes heated. Anupamaa tries to diffuse the tension, and Romil denies any wrongdoing.&nbsp;</p>

Jab Weekened Ka Vaar aaya toh jb mujhe sunaya jata tha na toh mai bhaut jaldi demotivate ya yuh boliye depression m toh uss din wo banda aake aadha ek ghanta mujhe bhaut achee se smjhaya. Toh jab smjhaya toh ek emotinal support chahiye hota hai na ki bhai yr hug krle, jo log apne bhai ko bhi krte hai, maa ko bhi krte hai, friend ko bhi karte hai. Toh elvish ko bho humne aise hi hbola tha ki yaar Elvish idhar aao bhaut akela feel kar rahe hai, toh buss aise buss kiye the. Toh ab aise pakadne se usko aise lag gaya ki humko usse pyaar ho gaya. (He was very supportive of me. When Weekend Ka Vaar came, and I was criticized or faced demotivation, or let&#39;s say, felt depressed, that day he came and explained things to me really well for about half an hour. So, sometimes you need emotional support, like a hug or like what we do to our brothers, mothers, or friends. So, I just said to Elvish, Come here, I am feeling quite alone, and we hugged like that. So, just by doing that, he felt like I had fallen in love with him.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went on to say, &ldquo;Then, the next day, something similar happened, and he said to me, &#39;Look, Manisha, I want to make something clear. I have a girlfriend outside, in case you have any feelings for me.&#39; Hearing this, I burst into laughter because I hadn&#39;t done anything to make him feel that way. So when he said that, I thought this guy is quite interesting, and I started having fun and joking around with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the conversation, Manisha also mentioned that she prefers a boy who doesn&#39;t already have or had a girlfriend before. She said, &ldquo;Toh bhai humko bhi fresh ladka chahiye. Jab mera pyaar fresh ho toh humko bhi toh aisa ladka milne chahiye na jo fresh hona chahiye. Hum kbhi bhi kisi or ka ghar tod ke apna ghar basana nahi chahenge. (So, I also want a fresh boy. When my love is fresh, I should also find a fresh boy. I don&#39;t want to break someone else&#39;s home to build my own.)&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>Manisha and Elvish&rsquo;s friendship:</strong></h3>

<p>Just a few hours ago, Shoaib Ibrahim shared a new vlog with his fans on his YouTube channel.

<p>When asked about their idea of love, Niti Taylor mentioned, &quot;I have a very weird idea of love. Is that okay? Please don&#39;t judge me. No one should judge me. I want my man to be obsessed with me.&quot; Parth teased Niti and said, &quot;Obsessed like stalking her wherever she is going.&quot; Niti continued, &quot;Not stalk and all but I want &#39;kucchi-poo&#39; type love I want. I like all that. I like possessive and protective.&quot; Parth continued teasing Niti and said, &quot;No one should be touching her. He must know where she is going. Who is there.&quot; Niti interrupts, &quot;No, not that much Parth (laughs). I want the cuddly love like that is something I want. I like PDA and all.&quot;</p>

<p>Sharing his idea of love, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/parth-samthaan">Parth Samthaan</a></strong> revealed, &quot;I think it&#39;s the most beautiful feeling. Like I said, it&#39;s not once that has happened to me (laughs). But somewhere I felt the initial six months or one year is the most beautiful period. It&#39;s the honeymoon period, that&#39;s what you call it. You have those butterflies in your stomach everywhere, irrespective of your age. You feel that, oh, it&#39;s new, oh, you&#39;re taking that person out on a date. Now what matters in love is that it should sustain over a period of time. Like one year, two years down the line, you should still feel like meeting that person. You should still feel like spending moments with that person and giving them care and attention, also giving that attention which you gave at the start. It shouldn&#39;t happen after two years that you think that person is with you forever, and let&#39;s focus on other things.&quot;</p>

<p>Further, he added, &quot;We guys, I would say, to be honest, we guys do that. I have seen a lot of my friends do it because we feel that this sort of responsibility is there in our life, and now let&#39;s focus on other things. That is something that we need to balance out. And love doesn&#39;t go without sacrifices. We both have to.&quot;</p>

His initial rise to stardom was catalyzed by the immensely popular social media platform, TikTok. However, when the app faced a ban, this influencer seamlessly transitioned his journey to Instagram. Despite this shift, Mr. Faisu&#39;s star power remains undiminished as he continues to amass a massive and dedicated fan following. Recently, Mr. Faisu revisited the place where he first met his rumored girlfriend, Jannat Zubair.</p>

<h2><strong>Mr. Faisu takes Jannat Zubair to their first meeting spot; Can you guess?</strong></h2>

<p>Faisal Shaikh, popularly known as Mr. Faisu, has embarked on a new venture with his chat show, &quot;Long Drive with Mr. Faisu.&quot; To kick off this exciting journey, he invited none other than his rumored girlfriend, actress Jannat Zubair, as his first guest. The vlog was shared on his YouTube channel on September 1st.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the vlog, Faisal posed a nostalgic question to Jannat, inquiring if she recalled the exact location of their first meeting. She humorously replied that even their fans knew the answer to that: it was at the airport. Delving deeper, Faisal asked if she could pinpoint the exact spot at the airport. Jannat recollected that it was by the boarding area, where he appeared worried, possibly because he was running late.</p>

<p>Faisal playfully disagreed, saying. He said, &ldquo;Maine sabse phele tumko airport gate pe dekha tha. Mai soch raha hu ki tumko exact location btaun ki maine tumhe kahan dekha tha. (I first saw you at the airport gate. I&#39;m thinking I&rsquo;ll show you the exact spot where I first laid eyes on you.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further said, &ldquo;Jab humne belt cross kiya tha check-in ke baad tab mujhe Prateek ne btaya tha yeh Jannat Zubair hai, jiska aap reels pe bolte ho ki itne views or likes kyun hai. (It was after we crossed the baggage claim post-check-in when Prateek informed me that you were Jannat Zubair, the one whose reels receive so many views and likes.)&rdquo; The conversation flowed as they reminisced about their journey from acquaintances to close friends.</p>

<p>To kick off the vlog, Faisal initiated a challenge, where he proposed that neither of them should use their mobile phones during their meeting. They decided that if one of them broke this rule, the other person would impose a punishment. Surprisingly, Faisal lost the game within the first 6 minutes of the vlog, leading to some playful teasing from Jannat.</p>

<p>For those who might not be aware, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/jannat-zubair">Jannat Zubair</a></strong> and Mr. Faisu share a deep-rooted friendship that extends beyond their professional collaborations. They have been frequently spotted together on various occasions and have even collaborated on social media.</p>

<p>Their bond goes beyond mere friendship; they are more akin to family friends. Both of them participated together in the 12th season of the stunt-based reality show, Khatron Ke Khiladi, hosted by <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/rohit-shetty">Rohit Shetty.</a></strong></p>

Rakhi, ever curious, asks Girish to sneeze again. However, Girish fails to oblige, and Rakhi turns her attention to Rajveer. Girish asks Rajveer to show them how he sneezed. Rajveer is confused, but he sneezes and tries that it sounds like he&#39;s saying Srishti&rsquo;s name, leaving Karan suspicious of this unusual coincidence. Unbeknownst to them, Srishti manages to sneak away, but Nidhi notices her leaving the Luthra&rsquo;s house like this.</p>

<p>Shanaya believes that making the significant other jealous is the key to capturing a boy&#39;s heart. She confides in Shaurya about Rajveer&#39;s strange reaction when she shows him a dupatta. Shaurya asks him if Rajveer likes her. She attributes it to Rajveer&#39;s obsession with her. When Shaurya presses her about her feelings for Rajveer, she teases him to figure it out for himself before walking away.</p>

<p>Srishti comes back home. Preeta asks Srishti if she was able to identify the attacker. Srishti, hiding her knowledge of Nidhi&#39;s involvement, reassures Preeta and asks her not to stress. She says that she needs more time to investigate. She leaves there, leaving Preeta suspicious about her sister&#39;s secrecy.</p>

<p>Sandy questions Shaurya&#39;s interest in Shanaya, noting that she isn&#39;t his typical type. Shaurya reveals that he&#39;s intrigued by Rajveer&#39;s obsession with Shanaya and hopes to exploit it to emotionally hurt Rajveer. Sandy wonders if Shaurya will date Shanaya, and Shaurya nods in agreement.</p>

<p>Karan notices Rajveer looking at Palki and Shaurya looking at Shanaya. Shanaya suggests that she and Rajveer go home together, but Rajveer insists on dropping both Palki and Shanaya. Shaurya interjects, offering to give them a ride instead. Shanaya agrees, and Karan silently watches.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nidhi confides in Aarohi about her frustration with Preeta&#39;s resilience. She wonders why Srishti and Preeta are avoiding the Luthras and suspects there&#39;s a significant reason behind it. She also says that she saw Srishti hiding from the Luthra&rsquo;s and wondered what was going on. Aarohi helps her calm down and gives an evil idea to Nidhi. She tells her to hire a hitman (Saphera) to eliminate Preeta, illustrating the depths of her animosity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shanaya asks Palki if she is a cook or a doctor. Palki explains her responsibility for taking care of Dadi&#39;s dietary needs. She mentions her extra efforts because of her love for Dadi.</p>

<p>Kavya informs Karan that she wants to go out to buy rakhi for Raksha Bandhan, but Karan advises against going out due to unfavorable weather conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To tease Shaurya even more, Shanaya suggests that Rajveer will drop her and he should drop Palki. Rajveer chimes in, suggesting that Shaurya take Kavya out to buy rakhi, while he will drop Palki and Shanaya.</p>

<p>Later, Rajveer confides in Mohit about the approaching Raksha Bandhan, expressing his desire to have Kavya tie a rakhi on his wrist. Mohit consoles him, reassuring him that fate may eventually favor his wishes.</p>

He asserts his authority in his company&#39;s project, making it clear that she won&#39;t decide who works on it. He urges her to move aside as he&#39;s running late. Pakhi pleads with him not to turn her husband into his enemy, but Anuj doesn&#39;t hold back. Romil calls Adhik a bad, fraudulent, evil, and abusive husband.</p>

<p>Pakhi, baffled, asks Anuj to explain her husband&#39;s actions. Anuj delivers a harsh truth, emphasizing that modernity isn&#39;t about appearances or education but a modern mindset. He draws a comparison between Pakhi and Anupamaa, who may not be as fashion-forward but is more modern in her thinking. Anuj condemns Pakhi for portraying herself as a vulnerable woman after being slapped by her husband, accusing her of embarrassing an entire generation.</p>

<p>Pakhi insists that Ashik will go to the office, but Anuj&#39;s response is ominous. He suggests that he could have Adhik sent to jail if he desired and instructs Pakhi to let Anu decide his fate. Anuj asks her to stop the drama. He warns her that he doesn&#39;t have time for her childish tantrums and demands to know if she&#39;s coming with him.</p>

<p>Anuj asks Pakhi if she is coming with them. Adhik tells Pakhi that he is okay with everything and that everyone may need some time to understand that he has truly changed. Ankush asks Pakhi to come along, she leaves for the office with Anuj and Ankush. Afterward, Adhik came into his real self and started throwing things on the floor claiming that Anuj and no one can behave like this with him. Romil says you are the parasite and pro-level cunning and abusive violent husband. Adhik asks him to stop or he will break his face. Romil says that he is not his wife who will tell him I love you even after hurting him, if Adhik even tries anything Romil will not keep quiet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Adhik plans to frame Romil for stealing money. He discusses his plans with Barkha, indicating his intention to frame Romil for theft. He believes Anuj will promptly eject Romil. Barkha supports Adhik.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kavya drops a bombshell on Vanraj&#39;s family. Tearfully, she admits that her unborn child isn&#39;t Vanraj&#39;s but Anirudh&#39;s. Leela, who had been celebrating Kavya&#39;s pregnancy, is devastated. She expresses shame at her behavior and accuses Kavya of sullying the family&#39;s reputation. She also blames Anupamaa and Vanraj for hiding the truth from her. Tensions escalate, and Leela pushes Anupamaa aside, berating everyone for their involvement in the deception.</p>

<p>Back at the office, Anuj reiterates his commitment to his work, emphasizing the importance of professionalism. He scolds Pakhi for allowing her personal life to affect her work and warns her not to bring her mannerless husband into his sacred workspace.</p>

<p>The family turmoil intensifies as Kavya&#39;s revelation rocks the foundation of their relationship. Kinjal and Toshu engage in a heated argument, a Toshu says that Kavya has gone down so much. Kinjal asks him to stop and suggests he should look into the mirror and see what he has done himself. Vanraj chastises Kavya for burdening his parents with her guilt.</p>

<p>Leela asks Kavya to leave the Shah house, and Anupamaa defends her, arguing that the child should not suffer for Kavya&#39;s mistake. She questions whether their acceptance of Vanraj&#39;s infidelity was any different and pleads for understanding.</p>

His journey on Bigg Boss OTT 2 became a topic of discussion due to his unfiltered opinions and perspectives. Now after his stint in Bigg Boss OTT 2, YouTuber Abhishek Malhan aka Fukraa Insaan is back to creating vlogs. His recent vlogs have been all about Bigg Boss, his friendship with Bigg Boss contestants, his reaction to the fights that happened inside the Bigg Boss OTT 2 house, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Abhishek Malhan indirectly calls out Salman Khan:</strong></h2>

<p>A few hours ago, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/abhishek-malhan">Abhishek Malhan</a></strong> shared a new vlog on his YouTube channel. This vlog was about his and Pooja Bhatt&#39;s fights that happened inside the Bigg Boss OTT 2 house. He was seen reacting to a fight when <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/pooja-bhatt">Pooja Bhatt </a></strong>questioned Abhishek&#39;s upbringing. He then shared, &quot;Now I realise that they spoke about upbringing in the Weekend Ka Vaar that happened after our fight. Even Salman sir (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/salman-khan">Salman Khan</a></strong>)&nbsp;said that upbringing was questioned and he pointed out Falaq Naaz and didn&#39;t point out Pooja Bhatt. You know what I mean? (smiles).&quot;</p>

<p>Abhishek continued, &quot;I remember this situation and Pooja ji questioned my upbringing but on Weekend Ka Vaar only Falaq di was schooled. Pooja ji was not told anything in the entire 8 weeks. She has said so many things. She said &#39;chote log choti soch&#39; (small people, small thinking) and questioned my upbringing.&quot;</p>

<h3><strong>Abhishek Malhan talks about Bigg Boss 17:</strong></h3>

<p>Recently, in the Q&amp;A session, one fan asked Abhishek, &quot;Will you participate in <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-17-celebrity-mentors-will-enter-the-show-to-bring-new-twists-report-1239385#:~:text=Bigg%20Boss%20season%2017%20promises,on%20air%20on%20Colors%20TV.">Bigg Boss 17</a></strong>, we want to see you.&quot; Answering this question, Abhishek shared, &quot;Even I want you to see me but not in Bigg Boss 17. I feel Bigg Boss OTT 2 has given me a lot. I like creating YouTube videos for you and making crazy content for you. I want to do a little social work, I want to make songs so I want to do that for now. I want to do hosting, I want to do little acting and a lot of other things so now I am focusing on that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now that I have not won OTT so I have a chance to go in the Bigg Boss season. So in future definitely you will see me there in Bigg Boss 18 or Bigg Boss 19 maybe,&quot; Abhishek concluded.&nbsp;</p>

Not many know but Avinash was earlier in a relationship with Falaq Naazz&#39;s younger sister Shafaq Naaz. However, while talking to a media portal Avinash denied being in a relationship with Shafaq. Now it seems like this didn&#39;t go well with Shafaq, who has now reacted to Avinash&#39;s claim. In a new interview, Falaq recalled how he and Avinash parted ways earlier and revealed details about their relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Shafaq Naaz talks about her relationship Avinash Sachdev:</strong></h2>

<p>While talking to ETimes TV, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/exclusive-video-shafaq-naaz-opens-up-about-her-marriage-being-called-off-family-was-the-problem-1230974">Shafaq Naaz </a></strong>shared, &quot;It&rsquo;s disappointing and hurtful. Avinash should have respected the dignity of our relationship and not trivialised my feelings by lying. Being in a relationship is not something to feel ashamed of. Probably, he has dated many people, so our relationship may have slipped his mind, but I remember it clearly since it was my first serious relationship and heartbreak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She further revealed how they started dating and how their relationship ended. The <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/happy-birthday-shaheer-sheikh-revisiting-mahabharats-arjuns-top-shows-as-he-turns-39-1214131">Mahabharat </a></strong>actress shared that she and Avinash started dating while shooting for Teri Meri Love Stories 11 years ago. Shafaq revealed that Avinash had recently come out of a lengthy relationship, and they had been a couple for approximately six months. As their relationship progressed, Avinash&#39;s communication gradually decreased without any apparent cause. He said, &quot;I assumed he had reconciled with his ex. He ghosted me. Back then, social media wasn&#39;t as active, making it easier to keep things under wraps. I can laugh about it today, but back then, it affected me.&quot;</p>

<p>Shafaq also mentioned how she reacted to the fact that her sister has become close to her ex-boyfriend <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/interviews/bigg-boss-ott-2-exclusive-avinash-sachdev-opens-up-about-debate-on-actors-vs-youtubers-in-the-house-1234480">Avinash Sachdev</a></strong>. The Chidiya Ghar actress said that she trusts her family and she knows that they won&#39;t do anything that will hurt her. Shafaq stated that she has no problem if her sister Falaq Naaz and Avinash remain friends. &quot;I am not so conservative to expect her not to befriend my ex. I am hurt because Avinash has disrespected the integrity of our relationship,&quot; concluded Shafaq.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before rising to fame, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-16-finale-live-updates-rohit-shetty-to-choose-khatron-ke-khiladi-13s-contestant-know-about-winner-1208932">Bigg Boss 16 </a></strong>fame Shiv Thakare earlier worked in a paan shop, distributed newspapers, milk and so on. When asked to Manisha how she felt seeing Shiv in those difficult times, Shiv says, &quot;Let me clear one thing. She has done all this first and I have followed her. Someone who sat at the paan shop first was my sister. She was in 9th standard and I was in 4th standard so she used to sit first. After her 10th standard was completed, my father thought it wouldn&#39;t be right to make her sit at the shop so then my turn came. Even she has distributed newspapers and even my cousin sister did. In my house, everyone has struggled together so that struggle never felt like a struggle.&quot;</p>

<p>Manisha adds, &quot;It never felt like a difficult job we also had fun doing it. It was never compulsory to do but it was not a burden. And our mother is very strong so because of her we never felt that we have struggled a lot and we are sad. Our entire family has enjoyed that time.&quot;</p>

<p>On the professional front, Shiv Thakare is currently seen in Rohit Shetty-led show <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/khatron-ke-khiladi-13-contestants-list-premiere-date-when-and-where-to-watch-the-rohit-shetty-show-1226657">Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 13.&nbsp;</a></strong></p>

<p>This anecdote is not just from childhood but it still goes on (laughs). My sister has this thing she is extremely ticklish like extremely, extremely ticklish. I don&#39;t know what is it with her and me and I think it only happens with me that I can actually tickle my sister without touching her. And when I say without touching her, I truly mean without touching her. I can just do those gestures from far away like &#39;I am coming to tickle you&#39; and she will laugh her guts out and she will roll on the floor without me even touching her and she will cry, like tears will flow out of her eyes and she will ask me to stop whereas I have not even touched her. So I think I do that a lot. I think I am a bully of a brother when it comes to being an elder brother. I think I really bully my sister a lot into doing so many things for me. I still do it unapologetically because I love her and I love to irritate her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This bond with me and her is just like there is no way in hell will my mom shout at me for doing anything so I will always be the ruckus creator and blame it on her. I still do it like I will enter the house and if I have done something which is going to be stupid enough like forgot to tell dad something or forgot to get something I will immediately be the first person to enter the house and I&#39;ll tell, &#39;Mamma, I have told her so many times. I even gave her the money to bring that thing and I even dropped her near the store but she forgot&#39; whereas I would have been the one who would have actually forgotten and she would get blamed for the whole thing. I am an actor so I would act like so innocent and I think that always works so I love bullying her.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Palki prepared soup for Bani. Karan asks her to give him soup. Rakhi said that the soup was meant for Bani, not him. Palki tells Karan that she will give him some soup too. Karan asks about Nidhi. Rakhi informed him that Nidhi hadn&#39;t come along.&nbsp;</p>

I believe that but also, nothing can define me. I&rsquo;m just an actor. I do understand one thing when we go to the market, people call us by character&rsquo;s name, does that mean I&rsquo;m too exposed as a character, but not as an actor.&nbsp;I want to be part of all the mediums, from doing TV commercials, OTT, TV, films, I do not want to leave any medium.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><strong>Dheeraj Dhoopar on TV vs. Film</strong></h2>

Mein itna sochta nahi hu.<em> (I want to do films, but I don&#39;t think so much)</em> I take it as my job and I&rsquo;m very passionate about my job. But I don&rsquo;t think about mediums. If I&rsquo;m working on TV, I&rsquo;m giving my 100%, I&rsquo;m seriously happy. If I&rsquo;m switching to films, I don&rsquo;t want to do it for the sake of mediums. I want to do something equally good that I&rsquo;m doing on TV. So, I&rsquo;ll always wait for it. If I&rsquo;m doing a film tomorrow, I want to do something great.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the professional front, Dheeraj Dhoopar will be seen in a web show, Tatlubaaz.</p>

<p>For the uninformed, the Bigg Boss 15 fame had accused Adil Durrani of domestic violence, robbery and murder. She had claimed that Durrani had been cheating on her with his Iranian girlfriend and even whipped out a large amount of money from her bank account. Sawant had even called him a criminal who was involved in many illegal activities including drug trafficking and even raped his girlfriend for over six years promising her to get her an entry through Sawant&rsquo;s popularity on the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alongside her, the actress has also accused, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/they-torture-me-rakhi-sawant-files-case-against-rajshree-adil-khan-durrani-and-sherlyn-chopra-report-1238500">Sherlyn Chopra</a> of hacking her Instagram account with over 10 million followers.</p>

<h2><strong>There is no progress on the case yet</strong></h2>

<p>Until now, there has been no update on the case with the controversy getting ugly with time. While Adil has denied all allegations, Sawant remains firm on her stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was only recently that Adil Khan held a press conference in Mumbai and levied allegations against Rakhi. Post that, the actress too came forward and shared her stance on the matter. For the unversed, Adil made a public appearance after he was released from Mysuru jail. He was arrested after Rakhi&rsquo;s complaints against him.</p>

He worships his work and there is no messing around when it comes to his work. He is so hardwired, committed, and motivated to make things big and succeed in doing good work, and it really shows. And next in line, of course, is his family. I always tell all my friends he is an all-in kind of person. He gives it his all when he is working, and when he is home, he gives it his all too. So it&#39;s his family; he is our everything. He is our knight in shining armor, our protector, shield, armor, and anything happens, I just come running to him, and I know he is going to make everything okay, and he does.

Every day there are new news and speculations surrounding the popular yet controversial reality TV show. While megastar <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/salman-khan">Salman Khan </a>will be returning as the host, it is also rumored that unlike the previous seasons the new season will have couples participating in the show. Now, another rumor which is doing the round is that Bigg Boss season 17 will also witness celebrity mentors joining the contestants.</p>

<h2><strong>Bigg Boss season 17 might have celebrity mentors&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>According to a recent report, Bigg Boss season 17 might witness some popular celebrities entering the show to guide the new contestants. These celebrity mentors will enter the show every week to give a better guidance and insight into a contestant&rsquo;s game. These mentors will be no less than a true friend as they will give the most helpful advice to the contestants so that they improve their game, thoughts, and actions and getting a better understanding of the audience&rsquo;s perspective. They will also give them an idea about who is their real friend or enemy inside the house and the necessary strategies during tasks which will push them to go ahead in the difficult game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things will definitely get interesting with these mentors bringing new twists and turns in the game. Whether this new format will help the contestants or backfire on them, only time will tell. For the information, in Bigg Boss season 14 we too had popular and strong ex-contestants <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/new-mom-gauahar-khan-calls-her-birthday-bash-special-due-to-this-reason-find-out-1238734">Gauahar Khan</a>, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/netizens-celebrate-sidharth-shuklas-bigg-boss-13-win-3y-of-historic-winner-sid-trends-on-twitter-1209399">Siddarth Shukla</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news-gossip/hina-khan-looks-enchanting-she-dons-pretty-green-ensemble-her-outing-pics-1164759">Hina Khan</a> entering the house and staying for almost 3 weeks as seniors to the new contestants. That concept was received well by the audience and so the makers decided to bring back something on the similar seasons. One thing is for sure the Salman Khan-led reality show will witness a lot of drama with these new formats and the mentors&#39; relationship with the contestants will change the dynamics of the house every week.</p>

Be it her on-stage performance or her interesting social media posts, Bharti left no stone unturned to entertain the masses. She carved a niche for herself and has received accolades for her talent. Fans shower love on Bharti for her comedy skills and hilarious comeback. However, the comedienne has now reconnected with her long-forgotten passion after 15 years of long break.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Bharti Singh reconnects to her long-forgotten passion:</strong></h2>

<p>At the start of her new vlog, Bharti Singh expressed excitement about reconnecting to her passion after 15 years. She first creates suspense for her fans by sharing how she is extremely happy about making a decision to follow her passion again. Bharti even asked <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bharti-singh-haarsh-limbachiyaa-worry-about-costly-hamper-arrived-for-golla-from-a-preschool-find-out-why-1223890">Haarsh Limbachiyaa</a></strong> to accompany her but he refused saying that he wanted to spend time with their son and puppy. We then see that Bharti reaches the rifle shooting academy and recalls how she used to do rifle shooting 15 years ago. The comedienne shared that when she reached the national level, everyone had their own riffle but she didn&#39;t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bharti mentioned that she then decided that she wanted to own a riffle after earning money but she forgot after getting busy with her work.

Nidhi and Aarohi inquire with Nilesh if Preeta is dead. Apologetically, he admits to failing in his task and explains that he was hindered by Karan&#39;s presence in Preeta&#39;s room. Nilesh reveals that he lied to Karan and managed to send him away to avoid suspicion. Nidhi expresses concern about whether Karan saw Preeta. Nilesh reassures her by telling her that he made up a story to deceive Karan that his sister is admitted to the hospital. Nilesh tells Nidhi that he will kill Preeta tomorrow as he cannot take any more risks today. Nidhi wants him to take care of Preeta today, but he refuses and walks away.</p>

<p>Nidhi, frustrated by Nilesh&#39;s response, contemplates the idea of killing Preeta herself. Her friend Aarohi warns her against taking such a big risk and reminds her of the Luthra family&#39;s presence in the hospital. Nidhi devises a plan to disguise herself as a doctor, hoping to carry out her plan without being recognized. She dons a doctor&#39;s disguise and sets her sights on eliminating Preeta.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Rajveer meets Palki and learns about Bani&#39;s injury. He expresses his concern for Bani and tells Palki about Preeta&#39;s accident. Palki wants to meet Preeta.

She plans to fulfill her mission of eliminating Preeta. Nidhi sees Rajveer and Srishti talking but sneaks into Preeta&#39;s ward unnoticed.</p>

<p>Karan notices Srishti and approaches her. Srishti pretends not to recognize him, and Karan playfully remarks that she&#39;s still the same short-tempered person. Karan asks her to face the truth and not deny it. Karan inquires about the situation, prompting Srishti to burst into tears. He points out that she&#39;s aware he&#39;s Karan, yet she denies it deliberately.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rajveer searches for Nidhi and visits Bani. He questions her about Nidhi&#39;s whereabouts, but Bani tells him that she has no clue about Nidhi. She embraces Rajveer, and Rakhi comments on Bani&#39;s affection for Rajveer, likening it to her love for Karan.</p>

<p>Palki visits Preeta and wishes her a speedy recovery, expressing concern for both Preeta and Rajveer. Nidhi arrives disguised as a doctor and instructs Palki to leave the room. She attempts to inject Preeta, but Preeta wakes up and halts her. Preeta rings the alarm bell, alerting the police. Karan, Palki, Rajveer, and Srishti hear the alarm and rush.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dimpy inquires about Kavya&#39;s condition from Samar, who informs her about the situation. Dimpy urges Samar to take her to the hospital but Samar asks her to stay at home. He advises her to stay calm even if Leela says something to her.&nbsp;</p>

Initially, he did not show me all these traits and then later after a couple of months, when I was in madly love with him. He started to get very possessive in a way like &#39;Why are you wearing this? Isn&#39;t your dress too short?&#39; or &#39;Why were you talking to that guy?&#39; I was like, &#39;I am working, I am on a set, he&#39;s my co-actor. He is literally playing my brother-in-law&#39;.

But no matter what, I am very clear that I am not going to go around asking people ki mujhe kaam do&nbsp;<em>(give me work).</em> When the time comes, they will choose me based on my performances,&quot; concluded the actor.</p>

<h2><strong>Abhishek Malhan talks about Bigg Boss 17:</strong></h2>

<p>During Abhishek Malhan&#39;s stint in Bigg Boss OTT 2, he was loved by the audience for his unfiltered opinions, dedication to win the game, performance in all tasks and perspective towards every house matter. Due to this, his fans wanted him to participate in the TV version of Bigg Boss&#39; upcoming season which is <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-17-did-bigg-boss-ott-2-winner-elvish-yadav-confirm-his-entry-in-the-salman-khan-hosted-show-watch-1238854">Bigg Boss 17</a></strong>.

<p>Further, the Bigg Boss OTT 2 first runner-up <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/abhishek-malhan">Abhishek Malhan </a></strong>continued, &quot;I feel Bigg Boss OTT 2 has given me a lot. I like creating YouTube videos for you and making crazy content for you. I want to do a little social work, I want to make songs so I want to do that for now. I want to do hosting, I want to do little acting and a lot of other things so now I am focusing on that. Now that I have not won OTT so I have a chance to go in the Bigg Boss season. So in future definitely you will see me there in Bigg Boss 18 or Bigg Boss 19 maybe.&quot;</p>

In frustration and anger, he picks up a puzzle block piece from the table and tosses it in front of Romil&rsquo;s overboard, causing Romil to trip and fall to the floor.</p>

<p>The incident triggers Romil, who responds aggressively by attacking Adhik and hurling accusations, calling Adhik a wife-beater. Adhik retorts that he may be a wife-beater but at least he&#39;s not an illegitimate child, a statement aimed to hurt Romil. The physical fight started.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pakhi intervenes to separate them, reminding them of the consequences of their actions. However, Adhik refuses to listen and asks her to stay away. Adhik&#39;s fury leads him to push Pakhi aside, inadvertently causing her to hit her head on the table corner.</p>

<p>Seeing Pakhi like this Romil was shocked and Adhik froze at the sight. Anupamaa&#39;s alarmed scream brings attention to the scene, with other adults rushing to Pakhi&#39;s aid. Anupamaa helps Pakhi to get up and ask for first aid. Romil tells everyone how Adhik initiated the fight. Adhik denies the acquisition and says that he insulted Barkha. Romil explains that Barkha was the one who started taunting him and he just replied to her.</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, Anuj reprimands both Adhik and Romil for their repeated mistakes and sends them to their rooms. Anupamaa questions Pakhi about the incident, suspecting that Adhik pushed her in anger. Pakhi hesitates to accuse Adhik, ultimately denying his deliberate involvement. Anupamaa blames Romil and decides that he cannot stay in their house any longer. Listening to this, Pakhi mistakenly confessed the truth in front of everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anupamaa warns Barkha to keep Adhik in control and advises the same to Ankush.</p>

<p>Romil grumbles about Adhik&#39;s actions and wishes Pakhi would retaliate against him for his wrongdoings. Adhik regrets his actions, contemplating ways to salvage the situation. He relies on Pakhi&#39;s protection, believing she won&#39;t let any harm come his way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Leela encourages Kinjal to visit her mother&#39;s house, but Kinjal is reluctant to burden Kavya with household chores. Kavya reassures Kinjal, but her discomfort grows as she experiences a sudden pain in her stomach.</p>

<p>Dimpy arranges a gathering with her friends and asks Leela not to create any scene in front of her friends. Leela remains distant from the guests due to her tension with Dimpy.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Adhik discusses Pakhi&#39;s complaint to Anupamaa. Adhik loses control again, accusing Pakhi of prioritizing Romil over her own husband. Pakhi starts crying, evoking Adhik&#39;s remorse, who apologizes and seeks forgiveness, blaming his anger on Pakhi&#39;s actions. Adhik lays his head in Pakhi&#39;s lap, murmuring apologies, and Pakhi consoles him, understanding his struggles.</p>

<p>Anuj reminds Anupamaa that they must handle Adhik and Romil cautiously to avoid more serious incidents. Anupamaa shares her plan to perform a puja for her family and Kavya, mentioning that Kavya has been feeling lonely lately due to Vanraj&#39;s absence.</p>

But then, whatever happens, you can&#39;t ask someone to respect you. If the other person doesn&#39;t want to respect you, that&#39;s okay and it is their call. But then the audience decides on the person whom they wish to respect.&quot;&nbsp;Further, he also admitted that he has never been against Prince.&nbsp;&quot;I have told him that you are like a younger brother. Let&#39;s just take off the show and let&#39;s give it a good head. But it did not happen that way. I was being poked throughout the show. However, I was like okay it&#39;s alright, he is a kid. He will be fine later. But it didn&#39;t happen later on. In one of the episodes, we became friends and we were fine. Even right now, I don&#39;t want any misconception that I am against him.

She warns Nidhi not to even consider harming Preeta, asserting that Preeta is not alone and has her family&#39;s support. Nidhi dismisses the notion, claiming she doesn&#39;t have time for such matters. Srishti firmly suggests Nidhi to stay away from Preeta and her family, clarifying that they have no interest in the Luthra family&#39;s affairs and suggesting that Nidhi should focus on her own household.</p>

<p>Karan sees Srishti and calls out to her, but she hurriedly flees, prompting Karan to chase after her. Seeing this, Nidhi and Aarohi get confused as to why Srishti is hiding from Karan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nilesh sneaks into Preeta&#39;s room. He brought a poison bottle with him and took it out of his pocket with the intent of ending Preeta&#39;s life within minutes.</p>

<p>Rajveer arrives at the hospital. He went to the reception and inquired about Preeta&#39;s condition. The receptionist told him that Preeta was in room number 5. He stopped outside the room and suddenly remembered how he refused to leave the city before when Srishti asked him to. He regrets not listening to Srishti&rsquo;s advice. Inside the room, Nilesh hides as Rajveer enters and expresses his concern for Preeta. He asks Preeta to wake up as he cannot see her like this. However, a doctor appears and insists on resting for Preeta. Rajveer apologizes and exits, leaving the doctor to examine Preeta.</p>

<p>Srishti&#39;s appearance brings joy to Karan, who questions her sudden escape and expresses his concern for her and Preeta. Srishti, however, keeps her distance and feigns not recognizing Karan. He&#39;s shocked and thinks that she might not be recognizing him because of his face, he tells her that he&#39;s Karan Luthra. Srishti tells him that she does not trust him and she runs away.</p>

<p>A doctor discusses Dadi&#39;s medical reports with the family, noting that she requires 5 hours of supervision and timely medication. The Luthra family is entrusted with Dadi&#39;s care.</p>

<p>In Preeta&#39;s room, Nilesh accidentally drops an injection but remains focused on his sinister plan. He attempts to end Preeta&#39;s life. Nilesh tries to strangulate Preeta, concealing his actions when he hears a knock. Karan enters the room and is surprised to see Nilesh. Nilesh fabricates a story about his sister being admitted to the hospital, and Karan offers help if needed. After Karan exits, Nidhi and Aarohi are happy to see Nilesh there and they mistake his presence, thinking that he has ended Preeta&rsquo;s life.</p>

She informs them that Pakhi has refused to join the office and has instead asked to give her project to Adhik. Toshu criticizes this decision, stating that the wrong person is being rewarded. Anupamaa asserts that Sweety&#39;s opinion does not matter here, and the final decision rests with Anuj as he is the owner of the company and he will decide who will receive the project. Hasmukh reminds everyone that just as good days pass, so do bad days. Kinjal suggests inviting Pakhi home for the Raksha Bandhan festival. Leela agrees, saying that the festival will infuse happiness into their lives.</p>

<p>Dimpy arrives, sees Anupamaa, and ignores her. Anupamaa greets Dimpy but she replies rudely. Despite the chilly reception, Anupamaa talks to her warmly. Dimpy asks everyone about the lack of power upstairs, and Leela asks her if she has paid for the electricity. DImpy is confused as to why they have to pay the electricity separately.&nbsp; Anupamaa explains that a separate meter was installed for the upper floor when rooms were built for the children. Dimpy reacts angrily, blaming Anupamaa for causing her inconvenience by not informing her about it. Vanraj clarifies that Samar was aware of the situation. Dimpy continues to berate the family and demands they pay the bill as Samar is at work. Anupamaa firmly suggests that since Dimpy has chosen to live separately, she should manage her bills. Dimpy leaves in a huff, and Leela expresses her concern about the children&#39;s suffering. Anupamaa advises her to remain strong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pakhi bakes a cake, and Romil joins her in the kitchen. Romil questions why Pakhi is tolerating her husband&#39;s behavior. Pakhi explains that she doesn&#39;t want to disappoint her family, having eloped against their wishes. Romil compares enduring abuse to addiction and suggests testing Adhik&#39;s behavior. If he fails the test, she should raise her voice against any abuse. Pakhi agrees, and they shake hands, bonding over their conversation.</p>

<p>Samar returns home and tries to turn on the AC, but Dimpy stops him, suggesting they use a fan to save on unnecessary electric charges. This leads to a discussion about the partition. On the other hand, Anupamaa notices Pakhi hugging Adhik&#39;s T-shirt. Anupamaa reflects on a woman&#39;s yearning for various forms of love in her life and approaches Pakhi. Pakhi explains she&#39;s folding Adhik&#39;s clothes. Dimpy&#39;s demeanor changes after the power is restored, and Samar encourages her to reconsider joining the family. Dimpy rebuffs his suggestion, emphasizing her independence and rules for household expenses.</p>

<p>Anupamaa tenderly braids Pakhi&#39;s hair and pampers her and expresses her concern about what she witnessed. Pakhi confides that she forgave Vanraj&#39;s mental abuse but questions the difference between them. Anupamaa emphasizes that not fighting back is cowardice and urges Pakhi to voice her pain. Anupamaa questions if Pakhi fears losing the relationship, love, or Adhik. Pakhi denies this fear. Anupamaa insists that she should never be afraid to voice her feelings, reminding her that her body and soul belong to her alone.</p>

Back then, I was greatly inspired only by Shah Rukh sir. I was highly inspired by his journey, and during that time, I used to watch only Hindi cinema. I grew up in a joint family with my uncles, aunts, grandparents &ndash; everyone lived with me. And every weekend, we used to set up a VHS player and watch two movies, on Saturday and Sunday. So, I&#39;ve watched a lot of Shah Rukh sir&#39;s films, both in theaters and on VHS at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;I have been continuously inspired by his journey. What he does, no one else can. That&#39;s what I feel. The charm he possesses, especially in romance, no one else can replicate that. And I&#39;m very romantic by heart. So, I was greatly influenced by him, by his journey as a boy from Delhi who used to do theater, then came to Mumbai, did TV serials, and became one of the superstars. That journey, in itself, is very inspiring. So, that&#39;s what it was &ndash; if they could do it, then there is hope that something can happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rao also mentioned that Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s journey not only served as an inspiration for him but also instilled hope within him.</p>

<h3><strong>Rajkummar Rao&#39;s upcoming series Guns &amp; Gulaabs</strong></h3>

<p>Talking about his upcoming Netflix series Guns &amp; Gulaabs, Rajkummar said, &ldquo;This is a set from the 90s. It was an amazing era, and this story is based on that period. It&#39;s the tale of a distant place, a city called Gulabganj. There reside some quite eccentric and really peculiar individuals. So, the character I play can do anything at any time. All of this is presented in a comedic manner; it&#39;s a very humorous series.&rdquo;</p>

However, Abhishek recently made a statement about Jiya, saying &#39;Stop hating Jiya.&#39; In response, I observed fans criticizing Abhishek in the comments, saying, &#39;You don&#39;t deserve this. You should go to Naagin, and you don&#39;t deserve Manisha.&#39; So many people said many things to Abhishek. I personally felt that it was the wrong thing to do. If I can be linked and hashtags such as #ElviSha #AbhiSha #ToNisha can trend then why can&#39;t one boy&#39;s hashtag like #AbhiSha and #Abhiya can&#39;t trend? What is the problem?&quot;</p>

<p>Taking <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/abhishek-malhan">Abhishek Malhan&#39;s </a></strong>side, Manisha continued, &quot;There&#39;s no doubt that Abhishek and my bond is amazing, but Jiya is also his friend. If some people like them together, then it&#39;s alright. Let them be. There&#39;s no point in fighting over this. I would suggest to AbhiSha fans that you can shower love on both me and Abhishek, but please don&#39;t say anything negative to AbhiYa fans. If I can be like with 2-3 people, then why can&#39;t Abhishek be liked with two girls? He can form separate bonds with different girls. So, kindly avoid saying anything negative about Abhishek because he is a very good friend of mine, whether inside or outside the Bigg Boss house. I can&#39;t hear anything negative about my friend, even if it&#39;s coming from my own fans. Everyone should come together with love.&quot;</p>

The elimination round featured Daisy, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/khatron-ke-khiladi-13-rohit-shetty-lashes-out-at-shiv-thakare-archana-gautam-sheezan-khan-calls-their-performance-ghatiya-1237153">Archana Gautam</a></strong>, and Nyrraa Banerji competing against each other.

Archana managed to complete the task in 6 minutes and 6 seconds, while Nyra took 6 minutes and 17 seconds. Daisy, unfortunately, took the longest time, requiring 10 minutes to complete the task, resulting in her elimination from the show.</p>

<p>Judge <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/indias-best-dancer-3-why-terence-lewis-is-missing-this-week-deets-inside-1233538">Terence Lewis</a></strong> chimed in saying, &quot;Aniket, if I may say that the solo you performed during your audition left us with nothing to compare with. That performance earned you a direct entry to top 12. And, &nbsp;I must say, today&#39;s solo was pure magic. The purity of the moment was incredibly beautiful. The way your legs moved, the slides, and especially the musicality you displayed in the first solo &ndash; when the lyrics ended, and only the music played, I absolutely loved that section. Aniket, you executed it with finesse, and it was a joy to watch. Aniket, you added a slide in the second section, and you did it playfully. I must say, in Hollywood, there were two amazing dancers, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly; their uniqueness was their comic timing, and they could have fun and play with it at a different level. Aniket, you matched up to the level of these dancing legends.&quot;</p>

<p>Produced by Frames Production, India&#39;s Best Dancer season 3 is judged by Geeta Kapur, Terence Lewis, and Sonali Bendre. The show is hosted by Jay Bhanushali.&nbsp;</p>

Barkha shouts at Romil but Romil dismisses the situation saying that he was talking about a manipulated social media photo. Adhik and Pakhi persist in acting like a loving couple despite Romil&#39;s skepticism.</p>

<p>Anupamaa takes the opportunity to warn Pakhi that Adhik doesn&#39;t truly love her and that he even hit her the previous day. Pakhi reacts defensively, accusing Anupamaa of attempting to ruin her relationship and shouting at her. Anupamaa realizes this was merely her imagination. Anupamaa returns to reality when Pakhi asks her for a thepla. Anuj tells Anupamaa to have breakfast.

Anupamaa urges Pakhi to finish breakfast and accompany her to the office, but Pakhi expresses the desire to take a break. Anupamaa insists she should start working before taking a break, and Pakhi suggests assigning the project to Adhik.</p>

<p>Dimpy mops the floor and interacts with Samar before he leaves for work. Leela gave him breakfast and words of encouragement. Dimpy observes Leela&#39;s gestures closely. Anupamaa reproaches Pakhi, stressing the professionalism required for work and reminding her of her role as a part of the project.</p>

<p>Anuj advises Pakhi to address the issue at the office professionally, emphasizing on her role and responsibilities. Anuj and Ankush leave for the office while Barkha leaves for an appointment with a dermatologist. Adhik tells Pakhi that he is going to the room, and Pakhi storms off, leaving Anupamaa exasperated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Romil&#39;s cigarette packet falls on the ground, leading Anupamaa to admonish him about the dangers of smoking and encourage him to pursue his talent in music. Romil says that it&#39;s cool to smoke and he needs something to get high on but Anupamaa says that if you want to get high use some more powerful drug, i.e., music.

Actor reveals]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-08/1953593246_siddharth-nigam-1.jpg"></img><p><strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/celebrity/siddharth-nigam">Siddharth Nigam&nbsp;</a></strong>needs no introduction! The actor stepped into the entertainment industry at a very young age and went on to gain immense fame and success. Siddharth starred in numerous projects which included fictional and non-fictional shows, music videos and so on. Recently, Siddharth achieved another huge milestone in his career when he starred in Salman Khan and Pooja Hegde starrer blockbuster film Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan. In this film, Siddharth played the role of Love, Salman&#39;s on-screen brother and his role was a brief one.</p>

<h2><strong>Was Siddharth Nigam disappointed with his role in Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan?</strong></h2>

<p>Siddharth Nigam is currently busy promoting his upcoming music video Teri Aadat 2 with <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusive-anushka-sen-talks-korean-connect-plans-to-collaborate-with-lee-min-ho-bts-blackpink-1210810">Anushka Sen</a></strong>. The Teri Aadat 2 stars recently appeared on Siddharth Kannan&#39;s chat show and spoke about their upcoming music video, their friendship, their love life and so on. During the interview, the host questioned Siddharth Nigam whether he was hurt because his screen time in Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan was less. The host also revealed to Siddharth that his brother Abhishek Nigam had expressed his disappointment about Siddharth role in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the host asked Siddharth whether he felt his role in <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/movie/kisi-ka-bhai-kisi-ki-jaan">Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan</a></strong> should have been more, Siddharth shared, &quot;I&#39;ll be honest and there&#39;s no filter in this. I felt very happy at first that I got a chance to work with Salman sir. Because it takes hard work to reach his stature and I got that opportunity directly from him. So it was a big thing for me. Also, I think God decides everything. When my film will come, you will see me more and doing it all. I don&#39;t want to show everything now. When my film comes that time I&#39;ll need everyone&#39;s support and love. That is something I am looking for. So it was very big for me that I got the opportunity to work with him. And for my mother and my brother, I am Shahrukh Khan, I am Salman Khan, I am everything.&quot;</p>

<p>Speaking about Siddharth Nigam&#39;s professional life, he started his journey in the TV industry and starred in numerous shows such as Chakravartin Ashoka Samrat, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 9, Aladdin &ndash; Naam Toh Suna Hoga and more.

Addressing the press conference Rajshree said, &ldquo;In no way does Rakhi Sawant have financially helped me ever, rather, it&#39;s me who assists Rakhi. I&#39;ve provided Rakhi with so much financial support &ndash; petrol for her car, a driver, afternoon meals, dinner, my car, my clothes, and even down to sharing my footwear. If I ever step out of my house with a nice purse, and she notices it. She&rsquo;ll be like, How could you have such a nice purse? Give it to me, Rajshree. And I am like alright, you take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rajshree further said that she sometimes feels like apart from her kidney, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/exclusive-rakhi-sawant-spills-beans-on-adil-durranis-iranian-girlfriend-reveals-why-he-was-in-mysuru-jail-1237652">Rakhi Sawant</a></strong> has acquired everything from her. She added, &ldquo;Rakhi is unwell, so I request the public to send her a get well soon message. She escalates situations to the point of getting them shut down. She has this confidence that she can harm anyone, threaten anyone, ruin anyone&#39;s business, destroy anyone&#39;s character. So, Rakhi madam, it&#39;s not that easy to do all these things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rajshree also said Rakhi is threatening her that she will say false things about her nail art business in front of the media. Rajshree said, &ldquo;She mentioned that nail art studios also engage in prostitution. She said that if I dared speak out in the media, she would go public with these claims against my business. She would go to the media and say that inside my shop, within my nail art studio, all these activities are carried out. So, Rakhi Sawant, I openly challenge you to prove this.&quot;</p>

<h3><strong>Rakhi and Rajshree&rsquo;s friendship</strong></h3>

<p>Rakhi and Rajshree&#39;s bond was akin to the iconic duo Jay and Veeru from the movie Sholay. Rajshree consistently stood by Rakhi&#39;s side, much like a pillar of support, especially during the trying time when Rakhi&#39;s mother sadly passed away.

<p>Fukraa Insaan and Jiya Shankar formed an adorable friendship&nbsp;in their journey in Bigg Boss OTT Season 2. Their endearing partnership even coined a sweet nickname from fans, &#39;Abhiya&#39;. During a Weekend Ka Vaar episode, they showcased their chemistry through a charming dance performance for a task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jiya playfully flirted with Abhishek during the Ticket to Finale task confessing that she finds him appealing due to his &#39;sharif&#39; (gentlemanly) demeanor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jiya Shankar faced elimination from Bigg Boss due to receiving the lowest number of votes, just days before the show&#39;s finale. Abhishek Malhan managed to secure the position of the first runner-up.

Meanwhile, Preeta is in the hospital, getting medical attention. Srishti is asked to fill out a form by a nurse. Srishti goes to the reception and fills out all the necessary forms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On being asked about her sabbatical leave before making a comeback, the 45-year-old actress revealed, &ldquo;I took a seven-year sabbatical because I wanted to be a hands-on mother. I feel guilty for not spending enough time with my son as I have to travel 14 hours every day so a mom feels guilty. When I was offered Anupamaa, I accepted it because it was a fabulous role. It was the first ever show where the female protagonist is in her 40s and I am glad the role connected with the audience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She further spoke about her husband Ashwin K Verma&rsquo;s support in her journey. The actress said, &ldquo;He had taken the back seat so that I could pursue my dreams. My solace is that my son has one parent to look after and it feels proud that a son is more attached to his father. We always speak through video calls and are even supported a lot by the production house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ganguly continued, &ldquo;We have set roles where the man is the breadwinner while a woman is the homemaker but we had a role reversal. I am proud to have a supportive husband like him. He wanted me to achieve my dream and get my due as an actor.&rdquo;</p>

It feels very bad. But I believe body shaming someone is a thing a small-minded person can do. An intellectual or smart person won&#39;t do it but Abhishek is very intelligent and it is very disappointing to see why Abhishek chose such mediums to fight with someone. When there is nothing left to say, they comment on a person&#39;s body or colour or height. This is a very small mind but I think Abhishek&#39;s personality is bigger than this. Even he must have learned something from the journey.&quot;</p>

<h2><strong>Bebika Dhurve talks about body positivity:</strong></h2>

<p>Speaking about body positivity, the <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-ott-2-grand-finale-know-all-about-finalists-cash-prize-when-and-where-to-watch-salman-khans-show-1235065">Bigg Boss OTT 2 </a></strong>fame shared, &quot;Well, I believe that I am really building confidence in a lot of women out there. Who are loving their shape, love their body and want to dress up the way they want to. Even Pooja Ma&#39;am appreciated me saying &#39;I will take you to Brazil because women there really love their bodies.&#39; There&#39;s Copa Cabana beach and she has been telling this time and again in the show that women love their bodies there and they never think what outfit they wear. Even I am putting out a very good example out there. I am getting a lot of DMs where thick chicks like me, thick ladies with thick skin, thick minds and thick hearts, they are messaging me and telling me that we really idolize you, we are inspired by you. I think it&#39;s an achievement for me. All this stupid, lame, body-shaming is getting really petite and minute and negligible in front of the inspiration that I am putting forward. If I am inspiring a lot of women out there to love their bodies the way it is and dress up how they want to irrespective of what the world will say then the inspiration that I am giving is very big compared to this small ridiculous body-shaming.</p>

<p>When asked if she was rejected in the TV industry for her looks, Bebika shared, &quot;There have been many times when I was rejected. On TV I never got leads because I was fat and I got the hero&#39;s sister&#39;s role. Now I don&#39;t know, now I am in the process. But yes many times I was rejected especially on TV so it used to be difficult but it&#39;s okay I always believed in myself. You have seen my confidence in the house, and you have seen my self-belief crores times so I think I will carry that ahead and I get it from my father. This straightforward attitude comes from my father and I am just going to carry it ahead.&nbsp;</p>

He used to make vulgar videos with her, and she submitted those to the police,&quot; revealed Rakhi Sawant.</p>

As I was leaving, I found out that the main highway had been closed. Someone suggested taking a smaller route from there. When I took the smaller route, there was also a landslide there, and a huge boulder came rolling in front of my car. Luckily, it didn&#39;t fall directly onto me or my car, otherwise, it could have been disastrous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actor reminisced about the instance when he attempted to displace a boulder and ended up fracturing his finger instead. Rakesh said, &ldquo;So when I attempted to move that boulder, I tried to lift it with all my strength. The rock moved slightly ahead but then rolled back. When it rolled back, my finger got caught beneath it, and my finger was cut quite severely. It was a really bad cut, and now it has healed, but it was partially hanging. I mean, if the cut had been a bit deeper, it would have been detached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;So, I stood there for a long time, and later a JBC machine arrived. It leveled the road and fixed it, so I could finally leave. But my heart goes out to the people who are still stranded there. I sincerely pray to God that they are safely rescued from there as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

Rakhi held Adil accountable for her miscarriage, labeling him a murderer.

He begs for mercy in front of the whole family. He implores her to save their marriage, highlighting the flawed thinking of some men who believe they can get away with anything, especially if a woman tolerates their wrongdoings. Adhik says that since childhood society tells them that men can do anything with their partner but it is the biggest mistake ever. Adhik pledges to rectify his behavior and promises consequences for future mistakes. </p>

<p>Adhik says that if he ever raises his hand again on her, Anupamaa can send him to jail, Vanraj can beat him to death and Anuj can ask him to leave the house. Various family members respond to his theatrics: Anupama suggests sending him to jail, Vanraj suggests adhering to his wishes, and Anuj offers assistance. Romil finds Adhik's performance exaggerated.</p>

<p>Adhik's display intensifies, with him breaking down and begging Pakhi for another chance. Pakhi, swayed by his act, forgives him, and Anuj comments that such emotional manipulation even occurs with major criminals facing imprisonment. </p>

<p>Anupamaa clarifies that she understands the situation, but Pakhi might not. Vanraj believes Pakhi desires to give Adhik another chance due to her exposure to failed relationships. However, her family remains skeptical, recognizing that Pakhi might believe Adhik's crocodile tears indicate change.</p>

<p>Amidst discussions, Anupama tells Pakhi that she is holding the same hand of Adhik’s that slapped her. Anupama acknowledges that although her family is considering Pakhi's betterment, she will ensure Adhik respects her daughter's feelings and never repeats his mistake. Pakhi reiterates her decision to rebuild the relationship, but Anupama remains firm, warning Adhik against further harm. She warns Adhik of the consequences if he mistreats her again.</p>

<p>Vanraj remembers his past wrongdoings and prays for Pakhi's safety. Samar, Toshu, and Leela express concern over Pakhi's choice to forgive Adhik, despite their attempts to intervene.</p>

<p>Dimpy says that Pakhi is the culprit here and might be playing a victim card. Leela defends her family while warning Dimpy against meddling in their affairs.</p>

<p>Anuj helps Anupamaa to calm down, Anupamaa becomes uneasy and faints.</p>

<p>Anupamaa worries that Pakhi might also be a victim of marital rape. She wants to find out more about it and is worried that Pakhi may never come out as she wants to save her marriage.</p>

However, I have observed lately that intolerance has reached new heights. Every human deserves to be respected irrespective of their preferences and personal backgrounds, that is what is real education, freedom and evolution for me. So that is what Monday motivation- let us love more and judge less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talking about Thapar&rsquo;s Instagram post she had posted a video of her&nbsp; Barbeque session with friends on a Sunday. In the video, her cook is grilling a variety of meats and vegetables. She wrote, &ldquo; A lazy Sunday Barbeque, love a little bit of good food, sunshine and fun on weekends.&rdquo; This did not go well with some people who started trolling for asking someone to cook non-veg and still calling herself a vegetarian.</p>

Adil Khan, who is Rakhi Sawant&#39;s ex-husband, has been making headlines due to his recent appearance in Mumbai. He was previously incarcerated on charges of fraud, theft, and assault, as detailed in an FIR lodged by Rakhi Sawant. Adil Khan held a press conference to share his perspective on the matter. Following the press conference, he spoke with Zoom, where he shed light on his personal experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adil mentioned that he had been disowned by his own family and conveyed his intention to unveil the truth about Rakhi Sawant, indicating that there may be untold aspects to their relationship.</p>

<h2><strong>Adil Khan shares that his parents disowned him after the false allegations:</strong></h2>

<p>During the telephonic interview with Zoom, Adil was asked if he hadn&#39;t told his parents about his marriage before. He said, &ldquo;No, I&#39;ll tell you. One day I was fed up with all the things Rakhi was doing. I thought I would inform the media to give me 2 days, and I would clarify the situation. Remember, that was my last video before getting arrested. So you tell me, why did I feel like Rakhi Sawant felt it was necessary to file a case against me overnight and send me to jail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;As soon as I said this, Rakhi announced the pictures of our wedding, and they went viral.&rdquo; Adil mentioned he had fallen asleep, so he didn&#39;t know all of this was happening. Khan further revealed how he woke up in the morning to hundred calls made by his mom. He shared receiving calls from his dad, his sister, and even his aunt who was in the UK. Durrani expressed how scared he was after calls from his family and mentioned wondering if something wrong might have happened in his family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adil continued, &ldquo;When I called them back, it went to call waiting.&rdquo; He mentioned it was right after that he opened Instagram and was instantly bombarded with notifications about his marriage with Rakhi Sawant. Khan shared, &ldquo;That&#39;s when I opened Instagram, and I was bombarded with notifications - &#39;Rakhi and Adil got married.&#39; And where is Rakhi? She&#39;s already holding a press conference. In that situation, what do you expect me to do? Shocked, I tweeted that I&#39;m not married to Rakhi Sawant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further mentioned, &ldquo;Then suddenly, my mom called and said, &#39;You&#39;re a big fraud. Just two days ago, you were convincing us that something wasn&#39;t right, and now you&#39;re sitting here married? Adil, you&#39;re the only son in the family, and you&#39;ve taken such a big decision about marriage without us knowing? Everyone is calling my family, asking if they knew about the wedding. What could my parents say? My parents disowned me. My sister-in-law blocked me. I was actually in tears. I confronted Rakhi, and she threw my clothes out of the house and told me to leave. Because now she had made the announcement, so she knew something would happen. I said, &#39;Rakhi, please don&#39;t do this.&#39; So she said, &#39;I will humiliate you like a dog, remember that.&#39;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adil further revealed that when he was outside, he spoke to a friend of Rakhi&#39;s named Rajshree, who he shared a close bond with. He mentioned he told Rajshree &ldquo;she has ruined me, she hasn&#39;t spared my family either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, in January, Rakhi disclosed her marital status with Adil and even shared images from their private wedding ceremony.</p>

<h3><strong>Adil Khan Durrani and Rakhi Sawant&rsquo;s love story</strong></h3>

Shortly after which, Rakhi was involved romantically with Adil after her separation from her former husband, Ritesh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In January this year, Rakhi openly shared her marital status and showcased pictures from their private wedding ceremony. Rakhi also said that post-marriage, Sawant embraced Islam and adopted the name Fatima Durrani.&nbsp;</p>

This familiar narrative arc, where initial hostility evolves into profound affection, has been a staple in numerous romantic narratives across various mediums.</p>

<p>Vandana&#39;s dream of becoming a playback singer is nurtured by her father&#39;s training and her dedication. As she auditions for Kunal&#39;s music studio, her hopes seem to align with the opportunity at hand. An audio clip of Vandana&#39;s mesmerizing voice impresses Kunal&#39;s friend, who deems her suitable for their label. However, the clich&eacute; takes root when Kunal, the arbiter of Vandana&#39;s destiny, chooses to disregard her talent. As Vandana starts singing, he insults her and leaves the studio.</p>

<p>While the premise of the show appears to tread the path of well-worn clich&eacute;s, the execution and chemistry between the lead actors could potentially lend a fresh perspective to the storyline. Also, the musical element on the show can also prove to be entertaining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, Baatein Kuch Ankahee Si&nbsp;has embarked on a journey that many have traversed before- a journey from animosity to affection. With its choice of protagonists and their performances, the show has an opportunity to transcend the clich&eacute;d premise and provide viewers with a unique take on a classic theme. Whether it succeeds in doing so remains to be seen as the series unfolds.</p>

Palki says that Kavya is preoccupied with wedding preparations. While Preeta tells Daljeet that she needs chilies, Preeta and Daljeet head over to the kitchen. Karan arrives there. Shailendra is taken aback by Karan&rsquo;s sudden appearance. Shanaya explains that Karan dropped her and Palki. Karan says he is thirsty and requests for some water.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Karan inquires if someone else too stays in the house with them, Shailendra informs Karan that he and Daljeet reside in the house. Palki is about to fetch Daljeet when Karan asks her to stay. Karan wonders aloud whether only Shailendra&#39;s family resides there. Shailendra corrects him, mentioning his wife, Daljeet. Palki tells Karan that she will bring Daljeet. Karan, however, insists she should stay seated, inwardly convinced he heard Preeta&#39;s voice.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Daljeet hands over chilies to Preeta as the lights suddenly go off. Shanaya went to check on the neighboring houses&#39; status. Palki leaves to retrieve Shailendra&#39;s phone, while Shailendra himself goes for a candle. During this blackout, Daljeet and Preeta exchange pleasantries, with Daljeet searching for a candle. Preeta offers to bring one from her house, leaving the room. Preeta collides with Karan. Preeta drops the chilies. Preeta and Karan sit down to pick up the chilies, sharing a subtle moment. Palki returns and joins the two. Afterward, Preeta leaves the premises.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Shambhu contacts Nidhi, disclosing his plan to keep a watch on Preeta and try to kill her the next day. The lights return, causing Daljeet to scream upon seeing Karan. Karan apologizes for the disruption and takes his leave, having confirmed that Preeta isn&#39;t living with Palki&#39;s family. Despite his intention to avoid asking them about Preeta, Daljeet persuades Karan to have tea before leaving, despite his initial refusal. Daljeet confides in Shanaya about her intention to impress Karan and explains her reasoning for inviting him for tea.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Shaurya awakens from a dream about Palki and contemplates his feelings, attributing his thoughts to his concern for Rajveer&#39;s happiness.&nbsp;</p>

She believes it&#39;s acceptable for Adhik to have reacted as they love each other deeply, and she&#39;s determined to stand by him no matter what. Anupama disagrees with Pakhi, drawing a parallel to her own experience where she left Vanraj when he was wrong. Anupama says that Vanraj never raised his hand at her but still did wrong by her, so Adhik must be a devil to raise a hand at her partner like that. Pakhi says that she provoked Adhik and acknowledges her wrongdoing.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Anupama questions why the younger generation tolerates injustice while openly criticizing it on social media. Pakhi implores Anupama to stay out of the situation and let her and Adhik handle it. Barkha supports Pakhi, suggesting that interference isn&#39;t necessary if Pakhi doesn&#39;t wish it. Pakhi agrees with Barkha, saying that they&#39;ll manage the issue on their own, and this should be the end of the discussion.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">However, Anupama persists, arguing that the issue is larger than just Pakhi&#39;s personal situation. She urges Pakhi not to tolerate domestic violence and warns that staying quiet would lead to a lifetime of submissiveness. Anupama says that despite being uneducated, she had fought against the injustice that was meted out to her. She questions Pakhi on being an educated girl and tolerating it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">On the other hand, Kavya shares her sonography report with Kinjal. Kinjal reminsces her first sonography with her baby. Kinjal offers her support, while Dimpy observes them and walks away. Kinjal suggests that Dimpy may also miss her family but is too proud to admit it. Vanraj supports Anupama&#39;s sentiments, encouraging Pakhi to consider her family&#39;s advice. Anuj reinforces the need for mutual respect in a relationship, while Hasmukh and Leela emphasize their concern for Pakhi&#39;s safety over societal expectations. Romil hopes Pakhi comprehends her family&#39;s perspective and holds Adhik accountable.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Kavya inquires about Vanraj and the family, and Kinjal informs her that they are at Anupama&#39;s house. Kavya expresses concern, and Dimpy makes disparaging remarks about Anupama. Kinjal and Kavya warn Dimpy and tell her to mind her language and negativity, and Kinjal says that Anupama always has good intentions for everyone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Finally, the family continues their efforts to persuade Pakhi to take this matter seriously. Barkha advised Adhik to apologize to Pakhi and forget about his ego for some time. Adhik disagrees, Barkha tells him that apologizing is easier than going to jail. Adhik swallows his pride and apologizes to Pakhi in front of everyone. Adhik accepts his mistake and is willing to face the consequences. Leela suggests that if Adhik is truly remorseful, he should serve a term in jail for at least 5-6 months. Anupama supports the idea.</p>

Abhishek said that he thought of saying this but avoided it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Abhishek reveals why Puneet Superstar was evicted:</strong></h3>

<p>Abhishek Malhan shared that<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-ott-2-former-contestant-puneet-superstar-loses-his-instagram-account-fans-react-1232538"> Puneet Superstar </a></strong>caused an issue by purposely not properly cleaning the toilet after using it. Avinash Sachdev came across this situation when he entered the washroom. Abhishek also mentioned that Pooja Bhatt made a statement saying that &quot;I feel unsafe with him.&quot; Nischay then added that Pooja Bhatt was bigger than Bigg Boss and Bigg Boss listened to Pooja Bhatt. Abhishek then commented, &quot;Pooja Ji ne hi to trophy manipulate kar...&quot; (Pooja Bhatt manipulated the trophy...)</p>

<h3><strong>Nischay slams Pooja Bhatt and Falaq Naazz:</strong></h3>

<p>In his roast video, Nischay Malhan strongly criticized <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-ott-2-pooja-bhatt-to-take-an-exit-from-salman-khan-led-show-with-alia-bhatt-report-1232972">Pooja Bhatt</a></strong> for questioning Abhishek&#39;s upbringing. He mentioned that Pooja had been associated with controversies that also involved kissing her father, Mahesh Bhatt, and had made comments about Abhishek&#39;s upbringing. Similarly, Nischay also slammed Falaq Naazz for criticizing Abhishek&#39;s upbringing, especially considering that Falaq&#39;s own brother Sheezan Khan was arrested in connection with Tunisha Sharma&#39;s suicide case.</p>

<p>During this conversation, Abhishek reacted with laughter and shared his confusion about the former contestants all naming <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-ott-2-winner-elvish-yadav-breaks-mc-stans-record-with-5-9-lakh-viewers-on-his-live-1237043">Elvish Yadav </a></strong>as the winner during the grand finale night. He suggested that they might have seen Nischay&#39;s roast video. Abhishek expressed his surprise at everyone choosing Elvish, even though they had good relationships with him. He mentioned that no one had the courage to speak openly in front of him. Abhishek criticized Falaq Naaz for her actions.</p>

<h3><strong>Abhishek reacts to Avinash Sachdev&#39;s action:</strong></h3>

<p>Abhishek Malhan watched a clip from an episode where he had a disagreement with <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/bigg-boss-ott-2-exclusive-video-avinash-sachdev-wants-this-contestant-to-win-can-you-guess-1235631">Avinash Sachdev</a></strong>, and Avinash had shown him the middle finger. Abhishek admitted that he had been unaware of Avinash&#39;s gesture and mentioned that Avinash did not have the courage to address him directly. Instead, Avinash had talked behind his back to Pooja Bhatt. Abhishek then explained how he confronted Avinash directly about the issue but then his &quot;36-year-old&quot; comment was made an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Abhishek compares Bigg Boss to Squid Game:</strong></h3>

<p>Abhishek compared Bigg Boss to <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/interviews/bigg-boss-ott-2-exclusive-avinash-sachdev-opens-up-about-debate-on-actors-vs-youtubers-in-the-house-1234480">Squid Game</a></strong> in real life and shared that the show is not scripted at all. He recalled how for 60 days, they were locked, and even they were not allowed to touch the blinds. Addressing YouTubers who may believe it&#39;s easy, he shared his firsthand experience of staying there for 60 days. He revealed that after about 15 days, he felt like leaving the Bigg Boss house. He explained that being locked in one house and staying awake for 8 hours without a phone is genuinely mentally torturing. Abhishek shared that whoever thinks about joining Bigg Boss should think 200 times. Abhishek stated that the number of followers will increase later but it is not easy as staying in Bigg Boss as the two months will be torturing.&nbsp;</p>

In the past episodes, Savi faced bullying from Ishaan&#39;s (<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/ghum-hai-kisikey-pyaar-meiin-promo-will-ishaan-deny-admission-to-savi-because-of-isha-1233527">Shakti Arora</a></strong>) sister, Durva, and experienced harassment from Durva&#39;s friend. Because of this, she&#39;s determined to get justice and has talked to Ishaan and the Bhosale family about it. Anvi, Ishaan&#39;s other sister, admitted the truth to Ishaan, which made him decide to support Savi in punishing Durva&#39;s friend. It will be interesting to see will Ishaan and Savi&#39;s relationship grow because of this or will get worse.</p>

<p>Starring Jasmin Bhasin and Aly Goni, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/exclusive-video-aly-goni-shares-how-people-didnt-have-faith-in-him-and-opens-up-on-his-struggle-1201168">Saawan Aa Gaya i</a></strong>s sung by Neha Kakkar and Rohanpreet Singh.

Saawan Aa Gaya will release on August 25 on T Series YouTube channel.&nbsp;Prior to Saawan Aa Gaya, Aly Goni, and Jasmin Bhasin collaborated on a song titled<strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/why-did-aly-goni-make-girlfriend-jasmin-bhasin-emotional-on-her-birthday-1227748"> Allah De Bandeya </a></strong>which was released on August 9, 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier while talking about their equation, Aly shared, &quot;Nothing has changed we are the same as we were earlier. There is no unnecessary possessiveness or questions from both side. It is the same and the best. Because I think be it friendship, relationship or any other equation, you have to save it yourself. You must know how it is going, and you must never add unnecessary effort. If you overthink things about your partner then your relationship is standing at the last point. What is she doing? Where is she? Why is she online? if you think this then the relationship will end. I think if a person thinks this then it is better to not be in a relationship. If you don&#39;t trust your partner then don&#39;t be in a relationship,&quot; concluded the actor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that you know what the disease is, let&#39;s understand what you can do to prevent it. To ensure that you romance the rains without getting sick, it&rsquo;s necessary to take some preventive measures.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Get vaccinated:</strong> The annual flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza. It&#39;s recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, especially those at higher risk, such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic health conditions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Practice good hygiene: </strong>Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in public places, touching surfaces, or coming into contact with someone who might be sick. If soap and water aren&#39;t available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.&nbsp;Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, as these are entry points for the virus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Avoid close contact:</strong> Try to stay away from people who are sick, and if you are feeling unwell, stay home to avoid spreading the virus to others. Maintain a safe distance from individuals who are coughing, sneezing, or exhibiting flu-like symptoms.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Cover Your Mouth and Nose:</strong> When you cough or sneeze, use a tissue to cover your mouth and nose, or cough/sneeze into your elbow to prevent the spread of germs. Dispose of used tissues immediately and wash your hands afterward.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Maintain a healthy lifestyle: </strong>A strong immune system can help you fight off infections. Get regular exercise, eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and ensure you&#39;re getting enough sleep. Also, drink plenty of water and avoid excessive consumption of sugary drinks.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Clean and disinfect:</strong> Regularly clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, and electronic devices.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that no preventive measure is foolproof, but by adopting these practices, you can significantly reduce your risk of contracting and spreading the flu virus. If you do become ill, it&#39;s important to seek medical attention and follow your healthcare provider&#39;s advice.</p>

I understand why, because when Tara got high fever on this Thursday night, it was like a nightmare to all of us.Tara went to school on Thursday after a long break from Independence Day week. Most of the time, it isn&rsquo;t serious. Fevers are very common. But this time it got really serious for our Tara.</em></p>

<p><em>We tried giving her medicines after disussing it with the doctors, but even after giving her IBUGESIC PLUS, her fever continued to be 104 and above. It became really stressful for us. We gave her cold dips of water, sponging at night, still she was shivering and the temperature was getting worse. I spoke to her doctor at 1 in the midnight and he said there&rsquo;s nothing to worry as all the kids are catching up with viral these days and they are falling sick. But as a mother, I had to worry, so it was a sleepless night for us. Friday morning, I had to immediately rush to the hospital on a Saturday afternoon and the doctors ran some tests on her and she was infected with INFLUENZA A FLU. It is a very contagious viral infection of the respiratory system. It causes a high fever, body aches, a cough, and other symptoms. Most children are ill with the flu for less than a week. But some children have a more serious illness and may need to be treated in the hospital. So it was best for us to get her admitted.</em></p>

<p><em>Please ensure your child has plenty of bed rest, encourage them to drink lots of fluids. Don&rsquo;t forget to take your flu shots, especially the elders. Avoid sending kids to school even if they have a running nose. This Flu shouldn&rsquo;t be taken lightly and please start taking good care of kids if their immunity is weak. Take care of yourself and the other people in your family. If you haven&rsquo;t already, speak to your doctor about getting the flu vaccine for you and other family members.</em></p>

<p><em>Tara is getting better day by day. As today is the 4th day and she is insisting to go home. And hopefully by evening we will be home. No matter how much I try to be strong but whenever it comes to Tara, I always have a breakdown. I don&rsquo;t wish to see any child in this condition. Rab Rakha.&quot;</em></p>

Rakhi echoes the sentiment, encouraging them to participate alongside Kavya. Despite his initial hesitance to dance in front of everyone, Rajveer is coaxed by their collective enthusiasm and ends up performing with Kavya and Palki.</p>

<p>Rakhi and Dadi praise Rajveer&#39;s performance, leaving him bashful. To avoid the attention, he heads to the kitchen for a glass of water. Palki follows him, noticing he is drinking cold water, but Shrishti told Palki earlier that Rajveer prefers room-temperature water.</p>

<p>Palki scolds Rajveer for drinking cold water and not taking care of himself. She lectures him about health and well-being, but Rajveer becomes captivated by Palki&#39;s beauty and starts staring at her. When Palki catches him gazing, Rajveer blushes, realizing he had been lost in admiration and hadn&#39;t been paying attention to her words. As the interaction continues, Palki asks Rajveer if he will take her somewhere, referencing an earlier conversation they had. As Rajveer didn&#39;t listen to the earlier conversation he was not sure what Palki was telling him but he promised to fulfill her request.</p>

<p>Observing Rajveer&#39;s reaction to the idea of going to a haunted place, Palki is intrigued by his lack of skepticism regarding her belief in ghosts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shaurya and Sandy converse when Shanaya purposely stumbles to gain Shaurya&#39;s attention. He saves her from falling and playfully warns her against such actions.</p>

<p>Shanaya then offers to perform for everyone, garnering praise from Kavya. This leads to Kavya suggesting Palki&#39;s performance, followed by her urging Rajveer to convince Palki.</p>

<p>Amidst the festivities, Shaurya draws Palki onto the dance floor, sparking a dance between them that makes Rajveer visibly envious.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karan is about to descend the stairs when Dadi encourages him to join the dance. Reluctant due to an impending important meeting, Karan is ultimately convinced, imagining himself dancing romantically with Preeta during his performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Afterward, Palki prepares to leave with Shanaya, but Karan offers to drop them home. As Karan&#39;s gesture continues, Rajveer doesn&#39;t invite Karan into his home, prompting Karan to tease him.</p>

<p>Gurpreet expresses her concerns to Srishti about Preeta&#39;s perceived connection to Karan. Gurpreet says that Preeta thinks Srishti knows something. Preeta arrives and mentions that she is going to Palki&rsquo;s place to get some green chilies.</p>

<p>As Karan leaves, he stops when he hears someone laughing and recognizes Preeta&#39;s laugh. He gets excited at the prospect of her being at Palki&#39;s house. His eagerness drives him to park his car nearby and enter Palki&#39;s house.</p>

Romil felt good and congratulated himself for timing Anupama&#39;s presence at the scene. Furious, Anupama glared at Adhik and swiftly took Pakhi away, holding her hand tightly. Romil speculated about Anupama&#39;s reaction to his misconduct and wondered what steps she would take against her son-in-law.</p>

<p>Adhik&#39;s panic escalated as he realized he couldn&#39;t lie now that Anupama had witnessed the incident. He felt trapped and knew he was in trouble. Anupama took Pakhi to her room and hugged her tightly. Pakhi attempted to downplay the situation, asserting that it wasn&#39;t what Anupama thought. Anupama questioned Pakhi&#39;s decision to cover up her husband&#39;s mistake and questioned whether she wanted to endure the same suffering Anupama had endured for 25 years. Pakhi defended Adhik, pleading with Anupama not to reveal the truth to anyone. Anupama called Vanraj over the phone, requesting him, Leela, and Hasmukh come to the scene.</p>

<p>Anuj overheard the conversation and asked Anupama if everything was alright. Anupama told Anuj that she wants to tell everyone something important. As Vanraj informed his parents about the situation, Barkha scolded Adhik for raising his hand against Pakhi. She predicted that Anupama would not let the matter rest and would undoubtedly take action against him. She warned that Anuj would cast him out onto the streets, and Vanraj would react aggressively when it concerned his children. Adhik admits that he had lost control.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Samar returned to his room, and Dimpy blamed him for the strained relationships within the family, saying how Anupama had severed ties with them. Samar left the room.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Vanraj confronted Adhik. Barkha supports Adhik, saying it is common between husband and wife. Anupama asks Barkha not to interfere otherwise she will have it from her. Leela speculated that Adhik might have physically harmed Pakhi on the previous occasion when she misunderstood the situation due to Pakhi&#39;s misbehavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Barkha attempted to manipulate the situation, suggesting that it was acceptable for Pakhi to slap Adhik, but he should refrain from reacting. Leela corrected her and emphasized that Pakhi had only raised her hand but hadn&#39;t actually slapped Adhik.</p>

<p>Anupama held Pakhi&#39;s hand, asking her if she had slapped Adhik. Pakhi denied it and revealed that it was Adhik who had slapped her. Pakhi writhes in pain revealing blue marks on her hand. Anupama and Vanraj were horrified by the evidence of Adhik&#39;s abuse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vanraj asked Adhik how he dared to harm his daughter. Barkha begged for mercy, and Vanraj&#39;s anger escalated to the point where he punched a sofa in frustration. Anuj intervened, advising Vanraj not to soil his hands with the likes of Adhik.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vanraj threatened to call the police, but Pakhi stopped him saying she didn&rsquo;t want to file a complaint. Anupama tries to explain to Pakhi that she should not tolerate domestic violence, but Pakhi denies it, telling Anupama not to interfere in the between.</p>

The show has been in the news ever since it began shooting as well-known personalities participated. Be the jaw-dropping entry sequence of the contestants or the spine-chilling water, height and animal stunts, the episodes of this stunt-based reality show kept the audience hooked throughout. The core concept of Khatron Ke Khiladi revolves around celebrity contestants pushing their limits by performing action-packed stunts that are bound to send shivers down one&#39;s spine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Rohit Shetty loses his calm at Nyrraa Banerji:</strong></h2>

<p>In Khatron Ke Khiladi 13&#39;s recent episode, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/happy-birthday-rohit-shetty-7-lesser-known-facts-about-the-singham-director-you-should-know-1212444">Rohit Shetty</a></strong> loses his calm at Nyrraa Banerji. It happened when Nyrraa Banerji was assigned a water stunt, but she aborted the task before performing it as the water was extremely cold. Following that, Sheezan Khan was set to take on the same challenge. As Sheezan was getting ready for the task, he faced some difficulties while attempting it. Host Rohit Shetty stepped in to boost Sheezan&#39;s spirits and offered guidance on how to tackle the challenge. During this, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/khatron-ke-khiladi-13-pishachini-fame-nyrraa-m-banerji-confirmed-for-rohit-shetty-led-show-1218347">Nyrraa Banerji </a></strong>asked for a hot water bag. This request seemed to irk Rohit Shetty, who then expressed his frustration with a stern, &quot;Nyrraa, ek second yar.&quot; Rohit&#39;s statement left everyone silent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following this, <strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/news/khatron-ke-khiladi-13-sheezan-khan-in-trouble-tunisha-sharmas-mother-sends-legal-notice-to-channel-report-1219819">Sheezan Khan </a></strong>made an effort to complete the stunt, but he managed to remove only one flag due to the cold water. Observing the situation, Rohit Shetty advised Sheezan to halt the stunt. The reason was that, as per the doctor&#39;s advice, staying in the pool for an extended period of time was not recommended.</p>
