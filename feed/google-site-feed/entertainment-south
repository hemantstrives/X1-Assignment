The couple is happy with the term Virosh that fans coined for them, and have named their marriage ceremony as &ldquo;The Wedding of Virosh.&rdquo; As celebrations inch closer, admirers have been revisiting old interviews, photos, and videos that trace their journey from co-stars to life partners. Among the most talked-about resurfaced clips is one featuring Vijay&rsquo;s parents, whose heartfelt words about their future daughter-in-law have struck a chord online.<br />
<br />
<strong>Vijay Deverakonda&#39;s parents on their condition for to-be daughter-in-law</strong><br />
<br />
In 2018, during the success meet of Geetha Govindam, the host asked Vijay&rsquo;s parents, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-peek-into-rashmika-mandannas-future-home-vijay-deverakondas-luxurious-rs-15-crore-mansion-in-hyderabad-1401034">Govardhan Rao and Madhavi</a>, about their expectations for their son&rsquo;s marriage. Madhavi shared that she wished for someone who would genuinely love and care for Vijay and understand the demanding nature of his profession in the film industry. Echoing her sentiments, Govardhan Rao said that he wanted his son to marry the person of his choice, irrespective of caste or religion. He added that he would be happy if Vijay married an Indian, preferably a South Indian. Vijay, present at the event, had lightened the moment by reiterating his belief in love marriage, joking that while the choice would be his, his parents would also need to adore the girl.</p>

<p>Over the years, fans closely followed Vijay and Rashmika&rsquo;s bond, strengthened through films like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/virosh-wedding-vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandannas-sangeet-dance-to-have-a-geetha-govindam-link-find-out-1401042">Geetha Govindam</a> and Dear Comrade. During promotions for The Girlfriend, Rashmika hinted at having a partner who helped her heal from past pain, sparking speculation that she was referring to Vijay. Reports later suggested the couple got engaged privately in Hyderabad last October, long before they made their relationship public.<br />

Even the smallest of updates are grabbing the audience&rsquo;s attention, and the latest buzz seems to be about the upcoming filming schedule of the film. As reported on February 24, the stars of the SS Rajamouli movie have proceeded to Georgia, where they will shoot &lsquo;crucial&rsquo; sequences as per Gulte. A separate report by Deccan Chronicle has claimed that the director will aim for action scenes between the protagonist and antagonist.</p>

<p><strong>Varanasi begins Georgia filming schedule</strong></p>

<p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, superstar Mahesh Babu was spotted flying to Georgia as previously rumored. The actor&rsquo;s team accompanied him at the airport as he headed for the next filming location, Georgia. It has been reported that the filmmaker, alongside DOP PS Vinod, previously scouted and fixed the venues for the shoot a couple of months ago, and will now be taking the actors there for a span of 12 to 14 days.</p>

<p>The makers are seemingly aiming to shoot crucial portions of the film during these two weeks. Buzz has claimed that &lsquo;massive action sequences and pivotal scenes&rsquo; starring Mahesh Babu and Prithviraj Sukumaran will be shot during this time. It is not known whether the lead actress, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-priyanka-chopra-jonas-calls-mahesh-babu-starrer-a-career-defining-film-says-ss-rajamouli-is-the-best-in-india-1400872">Priyanka Chopra</a>, will be joining the crew during this leg of the shoot; however, it seems unlikely with her ongoing promotions for The Bluff and the schedule focusing on the two male leads&rsquo; portions.</p>

<p>Helmed by SS Rajamouli, Mahesh Babu will play Rudhra in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/its-official-mahesh-babu-starrer-varanasi-with-ss-rajamouli-to-hit-big-screens-on-april-7-2027-new-look-out-1400342">Varanasi</a>, with some reports suggesting a dual role as Lord Rama or an inspiration angle. Meanwhile, Kumbha will be Prithviraj Sukumaran&rsquo;s wheelchair-bound character. Priyanka Chopra has been roped in for the role of Mandakini.</p>

<p>Varanasi is expected to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-update-ss-rajamouli-confirms-mahesh-babus-movie-to-wrap-up-shoot-by-june-2026-1400722">wrap filming by June</a>&nbsp;this year and then focus on the post-production work, including enormous VFX editing and more.

After the war, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna with the responsibility of protecting Lord Vishnu&rsquo;s final avatar when the time comes.</p>

<p>Six thousand years later, in 2898 AD, the world has transformed into a harsh dystopia ruled through fear by a self-proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to appease him in hopes of gaining access to his abundant land, known as the Complex, others rise in rebellion against his tyranny.</p>

<p>As hope begins to fade, a new light emerges in the form of an unborn child carried by SUM-80, also known as Sumathi. With Yaskin and his followers determined to extract the child&rsquo;s life force, an epic tale unfolds, setting the stage for the rest of the saga.</p>

<p>The first installment starred <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-on-how-he-wishes-to-do-more-films-for-fans-but-only-2-will-be-arriving-this-year-3-movies-were-to-release-1400932">Prabhas</a> in the lead role and also featured Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, and Kamal Haasan in prominent roles.

After months of speculation around their relationship, secret engagement, and upcoming nuptials, the two finally confirmed that they&rsquo;ll be getting married via a note to their fans. Announcing the &lsquo;Wedding of VIROSH,&rsquo; the couple is gearing up to tie the knot on February 26, 2026. Ahead of the big day, we&rsquo;re taking a look at the details of where it all first began.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong><br />
The duo&rsquo;s first known meeting was for the 2018 film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-rashmika-mandanna-cried-while-filming-geetha-govindam-with-vijay-deverakonda-for-this-reason-1339681">Geetha Govindam</a>. They began shooting for the same back in 2017, shortly after the actress called off her engagement to Rakshit Shetty. In the project, they starred as Vijay Govind and Geetha Kanuganti, who quickly became fan favorites for their chemistry, which led to a commercially successful run at the box office.</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong><br />
The following year, they were cast in another movie together, a rarity owing to the close timelines of both projects. But their on and offscreen sparks could not be ignored, and thus came <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/vijay-deverakonda-rashmika-mandannas-dear-comrade-plans-hindi-remake-siddhant-chaturvedi-pratibha-ranta-eyed-as-leads-1399576">Dear Comrade</a>, which essentially became the foundation of their dating phase. Rumors followed the couple no matter where they went and allowed them to test the waters with their fans, who were loving even the tiniest of their interactions.</p>

<p><strong>2020-2022</strong><br />
Secret dates and vacations became the norm for the couple. Their fans spotted them on multiple occasions, with the same backgrounds in photos and dinner sightings. However, the couple was tight-lipped and not ready to comment on it publicly, side-stepping all rumors and questions alike. They maintained that they were friends only, with Rashmika even saying that she was too early in her career for anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong><br />
During Animal promotions, she was asked to call up Vijay Deverakonda with co-star Ranbir Kapoor by her side. Answering her sudden call, the actor said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up re?,&rdquo; causing an uproar in the fandom for his casual tone. The actress blushed, informed him that they were on loud speaker, and the fans were convinced that the sparks were more than just that.</p>

<p><strong>2024</strong><br />
While never publicly confirming their rumors, the two hinted at being in a relationship. They did not reveal the names of their partners but continued to support each other&rsquo;s projects and drop subtle clues, becoming more open with their relationship.</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong><br />
Reports of the two having gotten engaged at the Kingdom actor&rsquo;s home in Hyderabad surfaced. It was said that an intimate ceremony was held in the presence of their families on October 3, 2025, with Rashmika being spotted with a new sparkler on her ring finger later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an appearance for The Girlfriend, amid ongoing success promotions, Vijay suddenly grabbed the hand of his lady love and dropped a sweet kiss, in his first public display of affection. The internet subsequently lost its mind and cheered for the two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple went on a Rome trip with their friends and featured in each other&rsquo;s social media updates, before which the actress jetted off to Sri Lanka for an apparent bachelorette party. This would be followed by them wrapping up their individual filming schedules, including Cocktail 2 for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rumors of a February wedding emerged with an invitation card revealing that the ceremony will be held in Udaipur with only close friends and family. It will be followed by a grand reception back home in Hyderabad for their colleagues and industry friends on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p>The couple finally announced their wedding to their fans amid heightened security around the venue, and is all set to tie the knot this Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

I didn&rsquo;t think it would ever be possible to rely on someone else. Thankfully, I was vulnerable enough to accept that kind of love and friendship. And I&rsquo;m a much better person because of the relationship I&rsquo;m in. Because of the person Raj (Nidimoru) is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 38-year-old has had a massive change in her personality following the divorce, and so has been noted by her own pals. She shared an anecdote about having met an old friend recently, who shared a voice note with the actress later, saying, &lsquo;This is the first time in a long time that I feel like you&rsquo;re not struggling to breathe.&rsquo; The star agreed, sharing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not performing anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Neethaane En Ponvasantham star dated the son of acting superstar Nagarjuna Akkineni, Naga Chaitanya, from 2010 to 2017. The two got married in Goa on October 6, 2017. However, the duo announced their split on October 2, 2021, after months of speculation. He then got married to actress Sobhita Dhulipala in 2024.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/samantha-ruth-prabhu-says-being-real-made-split-from-naga-chaitanya-public-lot-of-trolling-and-judgment-1397833">Samantha Ruth Prabhu</a>&nbsp;was later linked to the director Raj Nidimoru, with whom she worked on The Family Man Season 2, and is one-half of the filmmaker duo Raj &amp; DK.

Originally slated for a grand theatrical debut on January 9, 2026, the project has reportedly been stalled due to pending certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The delay has disappointed fans who were eagerly looking forward to seeing the superstar on the big screen in what is being described as his last film before a full-fledged career plunge.</p>

<p><strong>CBFC yet to begin review</strong></p>

<p>According to multiple reports, the holdup stems from the revising committee of the CBFC not commencing the review process. Last week it was reported, the newly appointed panel has neither initiated re-censoring proceedings nor communicated any official update to the production house of the film, KVN Productions. Without the required certification or acknowledgment, the makers are unable to finalize a release plan. Apparently, the lack of clarity has added to the further speculation in the industry, leaving the film&rsquo;s fate hanging in the balance.</p>

<p><strong>June 2026 Release to be considered</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new update shared by Valai Pechu suggests that the team is exploring an alternative release window. If pending formalities are completed in time, the H. Vinoth directorial could potentially arrive in theaters in June 2026. The tentative date being considered is Thursday, June 18, strategically kept before Vijay&rsquo;s 52nd birthday and coinciding with the Muharram long weekend.</p>

<p><strong>No official confirmation given</strong></p>

<p>Despite the growing buzz around a June release, the makers of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-thalapathy-vijay-confessed-having-one-sided-crushes-i-used-to-get-attracted-to-1380634">Vijay</a> starrer have not issued any formal statement. According to reports, it is indicated that internal discussions are ongoing, with June emerging as the most viable option should certification hurdles be resolved. Until then, Jana Nayagan release date remains unconfirmed, with fans awaiting definitive news on when Vijay&rsquo;s final cinematic outing will finally see the light of day.</p>

<p><strong>More about Kalki 2898 AD</strong></p>

<p>Kalki 2898 AD begins at the end of the Mahabharata&rsquo;s Kurukshetra War, marking the onset of the Kali Yuga in 3102 BC. After the war, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna with the responsibility of protecting Lord Vishnu&rsquo;s final avatar when the time comes.</p>

<p>Six thousand years later, in 2898 AD, the world has transformed into a harsh dystopia ruled through fear by a self-proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to appease him in hopes of gaining access to his abundant land, known as the Complex, others rise in rebellion against his tyranny.</p>

<p>As hope begins to fade, a new light emerges in the form of an unborn child carried by SUM-80, also known as Sumathi. With Yaskin and his followers determined to extract the child&rsquo;s life force, an epic tale unfolds, setting the stage for the rest of the saga.</p>

<p>The first installment starred Prabhas in the lead role and also featured <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-priyadarshan-says-he-wanted-to-make-hungama-with-amitabh-bachchan-and-not-paresh-rawal-says-making-last-attempt-1397072">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Deepika Padukone, and Kamal Haasan in prominent roles.

As the film&rsquo;s future remains unclear, a recent report has surfaced online indicating a possible sequel.</p>

<p><strong>Is Karthi&rsquo;s Kaithi 2 set to be launched soon?</strong></p>

<p>According to online reports, the makers of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/is-kaithi-2-still-on-cards-karthi-breaks-silence-after-lokesh-kanagaraj-announces-next-movie-aa23-with-allu-arjun-1400006">Kaithi</a>, Dream Warrior Pictures, have reportedly censored a video glimpse titled Dilli. The 30-second promo is expected to mark the announcement of the sequel and was reportedly certified by the board on February 19, 2026.</p>

<p>While there has been no official confirmation, it is worth noting that in Kaithi, Karthi played the character Dilli, who became a fan favorite. The project later evolved into the Lokesh Kanagaraj Cinematic Universe (LCU).</p>

<p>Earlier in January, Karthi was asked whether Kaithi 2 would happen. However, the actor revealed that he was not aware of any developments and said that only Lokesh Kanagaraj could provide a clear answer.</p>

<p><strong>More about Kaithi</strong></p>

<p>Directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/lokesh-kanagaraj-breaks-his-silence-about-quitting-kaithi-2-will-not-leave-without-completing-kaithi-2-vikram-2-rolex-1400209">Lokesh Kanagaraj</a>, Kaithi follows the story of an ex-convict, Dilli, who is forced to help a police officer while a mafia group is hot on their heels.</p>

<p>With Karthi in the lead role, the film features an ensemble cast including Narain, Arjun Das, Harish Uthaman, and George Maryan, among others, in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>The action thriller marked the first installment in the Lokesh Kanagaraj Cinematic Universe, which was later expanded with Vikram, starring Kamal Haasan, and Leo, starring Vijay.</p>

<p>Moreover, the upcoming film Benz, starring Raghava Lawrence and Nivin Pauly, is also set to be part of the LCU.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was speculated that Lokesh Kanagaraj would begin work on Kaithi 2 after wrapping up Coolie. However, the filmmaker recently announced that his next movie will be the Allu Arjun starrer, tentatively titled AA23 (LK07), marking his directorial debut in Telugu cinema.</p>

<p><strong>Karthi&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vaa-vaathiyaar-review-karthi-starrer-offers-a-fresh-idea-that-turns-loud-corny-and-forgettable-1400265">Karthi</a> was last seen in the lead role in Vaa Vaathiyaar. Directed by Nalan Kumarasamy, the film focuses on a police officer who is influenced by his grandfather to adopt elements of the late M. G. Ramachandran&rsquo;s cinematic characters.</p>

<p>As a result, the officer develops an alter ego that fights against wrongdoers while masquerading as an MGR-inspired character. Apart from the Thozha actor, the film also stars Krithi Shetty, Sathyaraj, Shilpa Manjunath, and Rajkiran in key roles.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Karthi will appear in the spy action drama Sardar 2, and he is currently working on Marshal.</p>

In response, the Baahubali actor said that he wishes to do more films for his fans. However, despite working on three projects, only two of them will be released this year due to scheduling constraints.</p>

<p>The actor said, &ldquo;I know what you all want. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to make three movies per year. But due to release schedules, only two are coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Prabhas&rsquo; lineup this year, The Raja Saab was released in theaters during Sankranti, while Fauzi is expected to hit the big screens during Dussehra 2026.

<p>Looking ahead, the actor will appear in Fauzi, a period epic. The film features him as a soldier of the Azad Hind Force and presents an alternative, fictionalized retelling of historical events.</p>

<p>The movie is set to feature internet sensation Imanvi as the female lead, with veteran actors Mithun Chakraborty, Jaya Prada, and Anupam Kher appearing in key roles.</p>

Every day, a new detail of their wedding is being shared on the internet, and now the duo has sought the help of a global team to help them with the management of any possible breaches on their big day. They will also be in touch with local authorities to ensure the smooth progression of the festivities. The two actors wish for utmost protection so as to maintain the intimate nature of their nuptials and have taken additional precautions to ensure so.</p>

<p>A source close to the couple shared, &ldquo;To secure the perimeter of the palace, a specialised agency from abroad has been hired. They will be collaborating with local Rajasthan security to assure absolute privacy of the events.&rdquo; The couple wished for absolute privacy of their wedding, with earlier reports suggesting that NDAs were signed by involved parties, including vendors and guests who were asked to be discreet about the same. A no-phone rule has been implemented at the wedding for all attendees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, it was noted that following the main ceremony on February 26 in Udaipur, which will be an intimate affair, a big reception will be held in Hyderabad on March 4 for friends and industry colleagues. Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna have previously worked together on Geetha Govindam and Dear Comrade, and have kept their relationship under the radar so far.&nbsp;</p>

Ahead of the wedding festivities, the actress&rsquo; former co-star Pramod Shetty has revealed whether she has invited them to her wedding or reception.</p>

<p><strong>Pramod Shetty on whether Rashmika Mandanna invited them to wedding</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the media, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kantara-chapter-1-review-rishab-shettys-final-transformation-as-chamundi-will-leave-you-breathless-rukmini-vasanth-suprises-1397366">Pramod Shetty</a> said, &ldquo;I haven&#39;t received Rashmika&#39;s wedding invitation yet.

<p>As per a report by One India, Pramod added, &ldquo;Rakshit will rise like a phoenix. He gave a statement recently, didn&rsquo;t he? He hasn&rsquo;t gone anywhere. That&rsquo;s how he writes his films. He takes some time, then comes back and calmly makes a movie. He isn&rsquo;t in as much of a hurry as we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those unaware, Pramod Shetty has been a long-time friend and collaborator of Rakshit Shetty. The Kantara: Chapter 1 actor starred alongside Rakshit and Rashmika in the latter&rsquo;s debut film Kirik Party, which was helmed by Rishab Shetty.</p>

<p>Pramod&rsquo;s comments about Rashmika and her wedding have gone viral on the internet, especially due to the shared history between the actress and Rakshit.</p>

According to a report by Gulte, the star director&rsquo;s much-awaited project, Baka, starring South Indian star Prabhas in the lead role, has supposedly been taken off the floors. As per coverage on February 19, the project has been cut off from the protagonist&rsquo;s side, who was seemingly unhappy after the first few days of filming.</p>

<p><strong>Prasanth Varma&rsquo;s Baka &lsquo;may not be happening&rsquo; after Prabhas steps away</strong></p>

According to the reports, the lead star was involved in a test shoot a few months ago. However, following the filming, the movie has seemingly been called off and appears not to be happening at all. Reports say, &lsquo;Prabhas did not feel comfortable after the shoot and is said to have declined the project.&rsquo; The actor has not yet made any comments on the same.</p>

<p>Tentatively titled Baka, the film in which Prabhas was set to take on the role of Bakasur was being backed by the famed Mythri Movie Makers. Neither the creators nor the director has shared an update on the filming or cancelation plans so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, similar fates were met with three other projects being helmed by Prasanth Varma. Firstly, Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s planned Telugu debut with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-and-prasanth-varma-amicably-part-ways-on-rakshas-due-to-creative-differences-1307753">Rakshas</a> (later referenced as Brahma Rakshasa) was canceled over creative differences and scheduling conflicts. Later, Hanu-Man was revealed to have had issues with the producer Niranjan Reddy, who claimed that a much higher expense came into play, unlike the projected Rs 20 crore budget. The film was released in 2024 with Teja Sajja at the forefront and went on to become a hit at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nandamuri Mokshagna&rsquo;s debut film, which was touted to be in the same genre as Hanu-Man, was cancelled on the day of launch and eventually postponed indefinitely. With Baka&rsquo;s possible end, it seems that director Prasanth Varma has more than a few shelved projects on his hands.&nbsp;</p>

The couple is reportedly keen on maintaining a low profile regarding their union and has enforced a strict no-phone policy to prevent pictures from the ceremony from being leaked.</p>

<p>Moreover, the official team responsible for organizing the wedding is required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). Additionally, in a rare move, the celebrity wedding will not include actors or colleagues from the film industry who have not been invited, and only immediate family members and close friends will attend.</p>

<p>Reportedly, two separate pre-wedding rituals will be hosted by Vijay&rsquo;s and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandanna-to-tie-wedding-knot-on-february-26-2026-invitation-card-goes-viral-1400797">Rashmika</a>&rsquo;s families, as both are eager to honor their respective traditions. Additionally, the couple will pen handwritten notes to their friends, requesting that no gifts be given.</p>

<p>Following the wedding, the couple is planning to take a month-long break from acting. A grand reception for friends and colleagues is scheduled to take place on March 4, 2026. Earlier, an invitation card for the duo&rsquo;s wedding reportedly went viral on the internet.</p>

Apart from Yash, the film features Kiara Advani, Nayanthara, Huma Qureshi, Tara Sutaria, and Rukmini Vasanth as co-leads. The cast also includes Akshay Oberoi, Sudev Nair, Amit Tiwari, and several others in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>The film has been shot simultaneously in Kannada and English and will be dubbed and released in six Indian languages, including Hindi, Malayalam, Telugu, and Tamil.</p>

<p>The music and background score have been composed by Ravi Basrur. John Wick action director JJ Perry has choreographed some of the action sequences, while the Anbariv duo has handled select action portions.</p>

<p>For those unaware, a glimpse of Toxic was unveiled last month on Yash&rsquo;s birthday, introducing the Rocking Star&rsquo;s character, Raya. The content showcased in the glimpse contained sensitive elements that created significant buzz online, particularly due to its perceived links to Geetu&rsquo;s earlier statements during a past press conference.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the upcoming period gangster action drama is slated to clash at the box office with the Ranveer Singh starrer Dhurandhar 2.</p>

<p><strong>Yash&rsquo;s upcoming film</strong></p>

<p>Yash was last seen in a lead role in KGF: Chapter 2. Directed by Prashanth Neel, the action film was a massive success in theatres and developed a cult-like following.</p>

<p>Nearly four years after its release, the actor will return to the big screen with Toxic. Additionally, he is set to play King Ravana in the upcoming Ranbir Kapoor-led <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/is-ar-rahman-taking-a-40-day-digital-detox-ahead-of-ramayana-event-heres-what-we-know-1400828">Ramayana</a>, which is slated for a Diwali release this year.</p>

Find out]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/437526047_dhanush-shankar-velpari-webp.webp"></img><p>After the release of films like Indian 2 and Game Changer, director S. Shankar is expected to helm a magnum opus titled Velpari, an adaptation of the novel of the same name.</p>

<p><strong>Is Dhanush being eyed to play a pivotal role in director Shankar&rsquo;s Velpari?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Valai Pechu, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/like-game-of-thrones-or-avatar-shankar-on-his-much-awaited-movie-velpari-rajinikanth-credits-him-for-tamil-cinemas-growth-1393535">Shankar</a> is considering Dhanush for an important role in Velpari. The film is touted to be a massive project mounted on a grand scale.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the director has inquired about the actor&rsquo;s availability, which is said to be the reason he appeared in person for the D55 pooja ceremony. However, the makers have not yet made any official announcement regarding this.</p>

<p>Earlier reports also suggested that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ranveer-singh-to-join-game-changer-director-shankar-in-dream-project-velpari-all-we-know-so-far-1400349">Ranveer Singh</a>&nbsp;and Chiyaan Vikram were being considered for the lead role, though official confirmation is still awaited.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/director-shankar-to-begin-his-magnum-opus-velpari-under-strict-budget-rules-after-game-changers-response-1400288">Velpari</a> is based on the novel Veera Yuga Nayagan Vel Pari by Su Venkatesan. The story narrates how the Chera, Chola, and Pandya empires sought to overthrow the tribal king Vel Paari and the events that followed.</p>

<p><strong>Shankar&rsquo;s previous movie</strong></p>

<p>Shankar last directed the Ram Charan starrer Game Changer. The political action drama revolves around an honest IAS officer who takes on corruption and abuse of power within the political system, locking horns with powerful individuals. During his fight for justice, he also uncovers truths about his past that are connected to present-day events.</p>

<p>Featuring Ram Charan in dual roles, the film also starred Kiara Advani, SJ Suryah, Anjali, Jayaram, and Srikanth in key roles. Game Changer was released in theatres during Sankranti 2025 but received an underwhelming response from both critics and audiences. The film is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Shankar had earlier announced a sequel to Indian 2, titled Indian 3, starring Kamal Haasan. However, there has been no official update regarding its release so far.</p>

<p><strong>Dhanush&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/mrunal-thakur-dismisses-marriage-rumors-with-dhanush-i-think-14th-feb-is-going-to-be-april-fools-day-1400694">Dhanush</a> is next set to appear in the lead role in Kara. Directed by Vignesh Raja, known for Por Thozhil, the thriller will feature Mamitha Baiju as the co-lead, along with Karunas, Suraj Venjaramoodu, and Jayaram in key roles. The film is slated for a summer release this year.</p>

<p>Moreover, Dhanush has also announced that he will appear in the tentatively titled D55. Directed by Rajkumar Periasamy, the project will be bankrolled by the actor himself and will feature Mammootty, Sreeleela, and Sai Pallavi in important roles.</p>

<p>Amid a lot of speculations surrounding the cast of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-plot-does-mahesh-babu-starrer-revolve-around-a-mans-travel-across-space-and-time-to-save-the-world-1398568">Varanasi</a>, a new report by India Today claims that actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kichcha-sudeeps-52nd-birthday-fans-request-better-poster-designer-for-billa-ranga-baasha-mark-first-look-is-lit-1396359">Kichcha Sudeep</a> has been roped in to play an important role. If it comes true, it would be the third collaboration between the star and the filmmaker, following their joint work briefly on Eega and then on Baahubali: The Beginning.

Even ahead of its March 19 premiere, the movie has yet to reveal its plot, with only brief looks into the characters and the story being made privy to the fans of the star. However, a new leak seems to have found its way to his admirers, as recently, a UAE distributor, Phars Film, updated the film&rsquo;s synopsis on its website. It hints that the plot for the project will see the lead actor turn into a ruthless gangster with no regard for others, but only his goal in mind. As previously mentioned, the movie will be set in Goa around the 1940s.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Toxic plot leaks on a UAE seller&rsquo;s platform</strong></p>

<p>Phars Film has revealed the following as the plot for Toxic on its website: &ldquo;Set in Goa between the early 1940s and the 1970s, Toxic is a savage action-thriller saga that plunges into the rot festering beneath paradise. In this coastal land of fading colonial shadows and rising crime syndicates, a man forges his empire through blood, fear, and betrayal.&rdquo;</p>

As smuggling routes become battlegrounds and loyalties unravel into suspicion, paranoia turns into a means of survival. In the end, the only force more powerful than the consequences of his choices is the abyss within him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Geetu Mohandas directorial is called Toxic: A Fairy Tale for Grown-Ups, with Yash at the helm as the lead, alongside Kiara Advani, Nayanthara, Huma Qureshi, Tara Sutaria, and Rukmini Vasanth. Produced by Venkat K Narayana and Yash, the film has been in progress under the KVN Productions and Monster Mind Creations banners.&nbsp;</p>

Directed by Sudha Kongara, the period political drama is set in 1960s Tamil Nadu and follows the story of Chezhaiyan, also known as Che, a young and peace-loving man. He works in the railways, is the sole breadwinner of his family, and takes care of his younger brother, Chinna Durai, a college student and activist.</p>

<p>As civil conflict takes center stage, Chinna actively fights against systemic oppression, even though his brother disagrees with his methods. However, things take a drastic turn when a vicious police officer named Thirunaadan enters the picture. Serving the government, he uses police brutality to curb the protests.</p>

<p>Amid all this, a life-changing event leads Che to undergo a significant transformation, prompting him to stand with the protesters his brother supports. How Che&rsquo;s life evolves over time, his bond with his sibling, and the challenges he faces form the core of the film.</p>

<p>Apart from Sivakarthikeyan, the film also stars Ravi Mohan, Sreeleela, and Atharvaa Murali in pivotal roles. It is currently available for streaming on ZEE5.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Sivakarthikeyan is also set to collaborate with director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/goats-venkat-prabhu-reveals-how-thalapathy-vijay-agreed-to-the-film-based-on-an-idea-i-told-him-first-half-only-1400119">Venkat Prabhu</a> on another project.</p>

Tamil film Soodhu Kavvum is planning its re-release on the upcoming Friday, February 20. It will join Thalapathy Vijay&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/remember-thalapathy-vijay-and-trisha-krishnans-iconic-film-ghilli-heres-where-to-watch-it-online-as-it-marks-21-years-1382966">Ghilli</a> and Ajith Kumar&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/exclusive-ajith-kumar-to-wrap-up-thunivu-on-november-29-film-expected-to-release-on-january-11-1200990">Thunivu</a> at the box office for a major battle between three big South Indian film industry stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 2013 release ended up as a monumental point in Vijay Sethupathi&rsquo;s career, earning him praise and accolades alike. It also became a crucial release in Ashok Selvan and Ramesh Thilak&rsquo;s filmographies. During its time of release, the film gathered an impressive Rs. 12 crore at the box office estimates, prompting a remake in Telugu called Gaddam Gang in 2015 and one in Urdu in 2018 named Chupan Chupai. It also gave rise to a sequel titled Soodhu Kavvum 2 in 2024, but it did not gain as much traction at the cinema.</p>

<p>Santhosh Narayanan composed the music for the film, Dinesh B Krishnan did the cinematography, and Leo John handled the editing, under the banner of Thirukumaran Entertainment with C V Kumar&rsquo;s production.</p>

<p>The Nalan Kumarasamy directorial&rsquo;s re-release was confirmed by makers Sakthi Film Factory with an announcement on its social media, with tickets priced at just Rs. 100. The original stars Sanchita Shetty, Karunakaran, Bobby Simha, Ramesh Thilak and Ashok Selvan, alongside Vijay Sethupathi in the main role, with Yog Japee, Aruldoss, M S Bhaskar and Radha Ravi, joining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mammootty said, &ldquo;Eyesight and hearing are very important aspects of human life. Even while breathing, some people are unable to smell anything.

Hearing is a godly blessing.&rdquo;</p>

Recently, the legendary actor took a subtle dig at films being subjected to censorship while speaking at a college event in Chennai.</p>

<p><strong>Kamal Haasan takes a dig at film censoring</strong></p>

<p>While speaking at Women&rsquo;s Christian College&rsquo;s Festeve &rsquo;26 in Chennai, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/how-does-sivakarthikeyans-virumaandi-look-in-seyon-link-back-to-kamal-haasan-heres-what-we-know-1400821">Kamal Haasan</a> screened his film Lead on Gandhi, which focuses on Mahatma Gandhi. As the chief guest of the event, the actor was watching the documentary along with the students when the screen suddenly froze due to a technical glitch.</p>

<p>Reacting to the situation, the actor quipped, &ldquo;Censor aa, thadangal aa? (Is it a Censor or just a glitch?).&rdquo; The students immediately responded with laughter and cheers. Shortly afterward, the technical issue was resolved, and the screening resumed.</p>

<p>Kamal Haasan&rsquo;s remark comes amid recent reactions from several actors regarding delays in the censor process for Vijay&rsquo;s Jana Nayagan.</p>

<p><strong>Kamal Haasan&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Kamal Haasan was last seen in a lead role in Thug Life, directed by Mani Ratnam. The film tells the story of Rangaraaya Sakthivel Naicker, a gangster whose shootout with a rival results in the death of a man, leaving the latter&rsquo;s son and daughter stranded and separated.</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, Sakthivel and his brother Manickam adopt a young boy named Amaran, with Sakthivel raising him as his own son. Years later, a conflict leads to the mafia kingpin&rsquo;s imprisonment. Upon his return, however, his foster son is treated as the head of the empire instead of him, sparking animosity between them. Their rivalry forms the crux of the narrative.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Kamal Haasan is set to appear in the lead role in a film tentatively titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/kamal-haasan-joins-his-kh237-director-duo-anbariv-sporting-uber-cool-casual-look-see-pic-1382190">KH237</a>. Directed by the action duo Anbarivu and written by Syam Pushkaran, the film will feature music composed by Jakes Bejoy. While official confirmation is still awaited, the movie is expected to go on floors after the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections conclude.</p>

<p>Additionally, Kamal Haasan is expected to reunite on the big screen with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanth-to-be-paid-rs-225-crore-for-film-with-kamal-haasan-heres-what-we-know-1400696">Rajinikanth</a> for an upcoming film, which is reportedly set to be directed by Nelson Dilipkumar.</p>

Now, the woman in question, Kaveri Baruah, has issued an apology on her social media account and revoked her words.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kaveri Baruah revokes remarks against Allu Arjun</strong></p>

<p>Taking to her X (formerly Twitter) account on February 17, 2026, Kaveri Baruah shared a note, taking back her words regarding <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/allu-sirish-and-nayanika-reddys-wedding-festivities-begin-with-pasupu-allu-arjun-skips-amid-aa22xa6-filming-1400708">Allu Arjun</a>&rsquo;s team issuing a 42-point document containing points to consider while being around the megastar.

<p>Previously, during her appearance on the Sweekriti Talks podcast, she said, &ldquo;Before meeting him, we had a note which had 42 dos and don&rsquo;ts. And they have manager ka manager ka manager.

<p>Through their struggles, the story highlights the plight of the marginalized. Suttu finds solace in freedom and chooses to leave. However, Charulatha remains, her future precarious as she is trapped within Pattada&rsquo;s cycle of violence and injustice.</p>

<p>Pennum Porattum stars Raina Radhakrishnan, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/dheeran-twitter-review-11-tweets-for-you-to-read-before-watching-rajesh-madhavans-action-film-1392970">Rajesh Madhavan</a>, Subhash Chandran, Shanooj Alanallur, Satheesh Pulikka, Dinesh Pe Po, Varsha Valsan, Manoj Kumar N, Akshaya Vijayakumar, and many others in key roles.

Directed by H. Vinoth, the film follows the story of Vetri Kondan, a former police officer and convict who adopts a young girl named Viji and is determined to raise her as a strong and independent woman. He even persuades her to join the military despite her fear of violence.</p>

<p>Amid these events, a grave threat looms over India, one that could potentially lead to the annihilation of its people. As Vetri Kondan finds himself caught in these circumstances, a personal vendetta also emerges, forcing him to take matters into his own hands and expose the system responsible for triggering the crisis.</p>

<p>Apart from Vijay, the film also stars Pooja Hegde, Bobby Deol, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/amid-jana-nayagan-delay-mamitha-baiju-breaks-silence-on-trolling-over-her-singing-how-people-receive-it-1400542">Mamitha Baiju</a>, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Prakash Raj, Narain, Priyamani, Sunil, and several others in key roles.</p>

<p>Earlier, the film was scheduled for a Pongal release but failed to secure CBFC certification in time. The dispute led to judicial intervention, which further postponed the release. However, it now appears that the film may finally be gearing up for release.</p>

<p>Initially, there were reports that the movie might be released in theaters by the end of February. However, with Thalapathy Vijay&rsquo;s film Theri expected to re-release this month and the Canadian distributor&rsquo;s recent post, it seems unlikely that the film will hit the big screens anytime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Suriya&rsquo;s father Sivakumar on initial disagreement over son&rsquo;s marriage with Jyotika</strong></p>

<p>Speaking with Galatta, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/suriyas-karna-update-rakeysh-omprakash-mehra-says-screenplay-is-done-confirms-film-will-be-made-in-2-parts-1400373">Suriya</a>&rsquo;s father, Sivakumar, revealed that he initially did not accept his son&rsquo;s relationship with Jyotika.

Then I thought about how, over the course of my career, I acted in around 150 films, and most of them had the concept of love marriages. So I finally agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, Sivakumar revealed that Suriya was a very shy person back in the day, and it was Radikaa Sarathkumar who persuaded him to go ahead and speak with Jyotika, which eventually blossomed into a relationship. The former actor even teased him, saying, &ldquo;He was simply living on his own, and now he is a father of two children.&rdquo;</p>

The latest update is that the couple will be hosting a grand reception in Hyderabad in March after tying the knot by the end of February this year. Apparently, the event will be attended by some big names of the South Indian film industry. Read on for more details.</p>

<h3><strong>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna to host star-studded reception</strong></h3>

<p>All eyes are and have been on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rashmika-mandanna-confirms-wanting-to-marry-vijay-deverakonda-and-looking-for-understanding-partner-1398308">Rashmika Mandanna</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rashmika-mandanna-and-vijay-deverakondas-wedding-update-heres-what-we-know-about-palace-venue-and-february-vows-1399498">Vijay Deverakonda</a>. That&rsquo;s why even the slightest of sneak peeks and inside tip is quickly picked up by eagle-eyed fans. Reports suggest that the couple is busy planning their intimate wedding, which is set to take place at a palace in Udaipur on February 26, 2026.</p>

<p>A couple of days later, they will also be hosting a star-studded wedding reception on March 4, 2026. According to NTV Telugu, the grand reception will be hosted in Hyderabad at a popular convention centre. Moreover, several South biggies and celebs from Bollywood are also expected to mark their presence at the event.</p>

<p>Earlier, Filmfare reported that the couple had visited their wedding location in Udaipur multiple times to oversee the arrangements themselves. While they are keeping their wedding close-knit, some industry besties of the celebs are expected to make an appearance at the event.</p>

<p>A source close to the development informed the publication that only Vijay&rsquo;s close friends, like director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/animal-park-exclusive-rashmika-mandanna-recalls-sandeep-reddy-vanga-telling-her-one-liner-that-blew-her-mind-says-its-going-to-be-madness-all-over-again-1362348">Sandeep Reddy Vanga</a>, and actors and directors who have worked with him, will be invited for the wedding. &ldquo;This is a conscious decision taken by them for privacy,&rdquo; stated the insider.</p>

<p>If rumors are to be believed, the couple got engaged at Vijay&rsquo;s Hyderabad residence in the first week of October, around Dasara. The private ceremony was only attended by their families. Having said that, neither Rashmika nor Vijay has spoken about their alleged wedding. However, the Animal actress told The Hollywood Reporter India, &ldquo;I wouldn&#39;t like to confirm or deny the marriage. I will just say when it&#39;s to be spoken about, we shall.&rdquo;</p>

But for Upasana, motherhood for the second time feels calmer and more conscious. It is also because her husband has been a hands-on father, among other things. Even before delivering her twins, the entrepreneur and philanthropist didn&rsquo;t take maternity leave. Here&#39;s why!</p>

<h3><strong>Upasana Konidela opens up about managing twins</strong></h3>

<p>Amid diapers and burp cloths, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ram-charan-upasana-name-their-twins-shivram-anveera-and-it-has-deep-family-connections-1400702">Upasana Konidela</a> continues to feel calmer. Stepping into motherhood for the second time doesn&rsquo;t feel chaotic, as she&rsquo;s been there, done that. In an interview with Variety India, Upasana revealed that her husband, actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ram-charan-to-start-sukumars-next-from-july-2026-reunite-after-historic-success-of-rangasthalam-1399484">Ram Charan</a>, has been a hands-on father, making things easier for her.</p>

<p>When she became a mom for the first time with daughter <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/ram-charan-and-upasanas-daughter-klin-kaara-konidela-turns-1-a-look-at-her-journey-of-precious-moments-with-family-1318791">Klin Kaara Konidela</a> in 2023, everything for her was beautiful and overwhelming. But this time, she feels more relaxed and grounded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned to let go of a lot, and now I don&rsquo;t panic over the small things anymore,&rdquo; says the entrepreneur, adding that managing twins is magical.</p>

<p>Watching her three kids together brings an extraordinary sense of fulfilment to Upasana. While she feels every moment is a learning experience, the mommy dearest admitted that her husband has been incredibly hands-on, especially with their elder daughter, Kaara. &ldquo;They share such a special bond. For us, making sure each child feels equally loved and secure is what truly makes the difference,&rdquo; expressed the mother.</p>

<p>Pregnancy is subjective. But Upasana didn&rsquo;t feel the need to go on maternity leave before delivering her twins, a boy and a girl. She explained that in her line of work, there isn&rsquo;t really a holiday. Hence, she&rsquo;s wired that way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure whether to feel happy or conflicted about it. My work gives me purpose and happiness, and my children give me pure joy,&rdquo; admitted Upasana.</p>

<p>She feels both her kids and business deserve attention and space to grow. Having said that, she is currently focusing on healing and slowly delivering her next hospital project. For her, life is all about creating a balance, and priorities shift with time. Over the years, she has learned to embrace that rhythm depending on what&rsquo;s needed.</p>

<p>After the birth of their twin babies, the couple hosted their near and dear ones at a naming ceremony. At the intimate event, they named their son Shivram and their second daughter Anveera Devi.</p>

However, after the Ram Charan starrer was postponed to April, the Nani-led film also moved away from its previous date. Coincidentally, this also pulls the film out of a potential clash with Pawan Kalyan&rsquo;s Ustaad Bhagat Singh, which is scheduled to hit the big screens on March 26.</p>

<p><strong>More about The Paradise</strong></p>

Viswanath. The cult classic has received widespread praise over the years. Recently, however, the leading lady recalled an experience from the film&rsquo;s shoot, revealing her insecurity while working with the Thug Life actor.</p>

<p><strong>Radikaa Sarathkumar recalls her memories working with Kamal Haasan</strong></p>

<p>Speaking with Galatta Plus, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/radikaa-sarathkumar-reacts-to-rajinikanths-silence-on-hema-committee-report-1345405">Radikaa Sarathkumar</a> opened up about working with Kamal Haasan and how she felt insecure about her skin complexion at the time. The actress revealed that she was supposed to hug Haasan from behind, but the scene felt awkward while filming, making it appear somewhat off-putting on screen.</p>

<p>Radikaa said, &ldquo;Director Viswanath asked, &lsquo;Do you both not like each other?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;No sir, nothing,&rsquo; and even Kamal was taken aback. However, the director sensed some discomfort between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What followed surprised everyone on set. Suddenly, he looked at Kamal, took a bottle of perfume, and sprayed it all over him. The team assumed it was about fragrance or hygiene. It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the actress added.</p>

<p>Radikaa then revealed that the issue stemmed from her own insecurity about her complexion. She said, &ldquo;I told <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/the-ending-how-kamal-haasan-and-sridevis-performances-in-sadmas-climax-set-the-gold-standard-of-a-tragic-love-story-1400592">Kamal Haasan</a> that you are too fair and my hands are two shades darker than my face. When he hugged me, I felt it looked very bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added that Kamal immediately dismissed her concern and laughed it off, telling her that it should never be an issue. The actress also mentioned that even today, Haasan teases her about the fixation she had back then.</p>

<p>Radikaa Sarathkumar will next appear in the lead role in Thaai Kizhavi. Directed by Sivakumar Murugesan, the comedy film is co-produced by Sivakarthikeyan under the banner of Sivakarthikeyan Productions.</p>

In the past 24 years, he has become a prominent personality, known for his craft and mannerisms. Among the many actors who spoke highly of Prabhas was veteran actress Bhagyashree, who was impressed by the way he conducted himself on the sets of their 2022 movie, Radhe Shyam. Read on to know what she said!</p>

<h3><strong>Bhagyashree lauds Prabhas&rsquo; humble nature</strong></h3>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/inside-prabhas-rs-60-crore-luxurious-house-in-hyderabad-see-pics-1377124">Prabhas</a> worked with senior actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-bhagyashree-talks-about-losing-self-belief-and-battling-depression-i-started-questioning-myself-1272616">Bhagyashree</a> in the movie Radhe Shyam. Since the Maine Pyar Kiya actress was returning to Telugu cinema after a significant amount of time, she was sceptical of Prabhas&rsquo;s behaviour towards her. While talking to TFPC, the actress revealed that her first scene, after a very long time in Telugu cinema, was with Prabhas.</p>

<p>So, when she walked on set, she thought the pan India would maintain&nbsp;distance from her. She was nervous, assuming that the Saaho actor wouldn&rsquo;t want to rehearse if she forgot her line in Telugu. But when Prabhas approached her, she was impressed by the actor&rsquo;s humbleness.</p>

<p>The Bollywood diva recalled in the old video, &ldquo;I walk on to the set, and he says,&nbsp;&lsquo;Ma&#39;am, we&#39;re such big fans of yours. We&#39;ve been watching your movie ever since.&rdquo; Upon hearing this, the actress took a sigh of relief. Calling Prabhas a &ldquo;humble person&rdquo;, Bhagyashree stated that it was very comfortable working with him. &ldquo;He didn&#39;t have any airs on set,&rdquo; she underscored, adding that not just her, but everyone was comfortable with him.</p>

<p>The Omkaram actress further divulged, &ldquo;He&#39;s not like throwing his weight around or behaving high and mighty, nothing like that. He wishes everyone on the set.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Prabhas&rsquo; work front</strong></p>

<p>Prabhas started 2026 with the fantasy horror comedy film, The Raja Saab, co-starring Sanjay Dutt, Nidhhi Agerwal, Malavika Mohanan, Riddhi Kumar, and Zarina Wahab. He is currently working on his upcoming project titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/not-independence-day-prabhas-fauzi-with-hanu-raghavapudi-to-release-on-dussehra-2026-heres-what-we-know-1400305">Fauzi</a>. Director Hanu Raghavapudi&rsquo;s period drama will feature Imanvi as the female lead. They will be joined by actors Mithun Chakraborty, Jaya Prada, and Anupam Kher. According to reports, the makers are aiming to release the film around Dussehra next year. Prabhas also has <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/after-deepika-padukone-did-another-actor-exit-prabhas-and-sandeep-reddy-vangas-spirit-find-out-1400569">Spirit</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-to-begin-shooting-for-kalki-2898-ad-part-2-from-february-2-heres-what-we-know-1400264">Kalki 2898 AD Part 2</a> in the pipeline.</p>

What initially appears to be a case of deadly animal encounters soon unravels into something far more sinister. As the remains surface and panic spreads, folklore and deep-rooted faith begin to shape public perception, blurring the line between superstition and reality.</p>

<p>As Hanmappa digs deeper, the case spirals into a disturbing psychological maze where crime, belief, and fear intersect. Forced to confront not only the mystery behind the killings but also the powerful faith surrounding them, he begins questioning everything he thought he understood about truth and justice.</p>

<p><strong>Cast and crew of Rakshasa</strong></p>

<p>Rakshasa stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/who-is-sriimurali-know-all-about-the-actor-who-played-superhero-in-bagheera-and-is-puneeth-rajkumars-cousin-1359250">Vijay Raghavendra</a> alongside Mayuri, Avinash, Malavika, Appanna, Abhijith, and others in key roles. Directed by Suhan Prasad, the show is co-written by Suhan along with Apoorva and is bankrolled by Tharunsudheer Productions.</p>

<p>During the trailer launch, Vijay Raghavendra said that Rakshasa was not a story that revealed itself easily. He added that what excited him was the silence in the narrative, the pauses, the unanswered questions, and the emotional weight carried by the character.</p>

<p>The actor further explained that Hanmappa was a man torn between duty and belief, and that the trailer offered a glimpse of that conflict without revealing too much.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Raghavendra&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Vijay Raghavendra was last seen in the lead role in the thriller Rippan Swamy. Directed by Kishor Mudubidire, the film also starred Ashwini Chandrashekar, Prakash Thuminad, Vajradheer Jain, Yamuna Srinidhi, and others in key roles.</p>

The film follows the story of Joseph, a bakery owner in Kerala who lives a quiet life with his daughter as a single father.</p>

<p>However, after a scuffle with a gang of local goons, he is forced to protect his daughter and reveal his true identity as DCP Vijay Kumar, a formidable police officer from Chennai who was presumed dead. As his identity is on the verge of being exposed, he must settle scores with an old adversary.</p>

<p>Apart from Vijay, the film also stars Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Amy Jackson, Baby Nainika, Radhika Sarathkumar, Mahendran, Prabhu, and several others in key roles.</p>

<p><strong>Thalapathy Vijay&rsquo;s Jana Nayagan</strong></p>

Vinoth, is touted as the superstar&rsquo;s final cinematic outing. The film follows Vetri Kondan, a former police officer and convict who adopts a young girl, Viji, and raises her to be strong and independent, even encouraging her to join the military despite her fear of violence.</p>

<p>As a grave national threat looms over India, Vetri Kondan becomes entangled in the crisis. With a personal vendetta also surfacing, he is compelled to take matters into his own hands and expose the system behind the unfolding danger.</p>

<p>Initially, the film was slated to release on January 9, 2026, coinciding with Pongal. However, it was delayed due to the failure to secure CBFC certification.</p>

<p>Ennu Ninte Moideen is a romantic drama that celebrates the eternal love of two individuals who could never unite in real life. Within this tale lies the story of a man who loves deeply despite knowing he may never truly have that love returned.</p>

<p>Set between the 1960s and 1970s, the film follows Moideen and Kanchanamala, two people from different backgrounds who fall in love. Although they are deeply devoted to each other, family resistance prevents them from uniting, even as they refuse to let go.</p>

<p>Amid this story, Panakkaparambil Appu is also in love with Kanchanamala and longs to be with her. However, as her heart belongs to Moideen, the film becomes a story of not just one but multiple unfulfilled loves.</p>

Wheelchair-bound and visually restricted in movement, Kumbha presented the actor with an unusual creative challenge.<br />
<br />
<strong>Prithviraj Sukumaran on his role of Kumbha</strong><br />
<br />
In a recent interview with Collider, Prithviraj spoke about his character of Kumbha. He said, &ldquo;As an actor, especially after doing so much work in the industry, you function almost subconsciously, always aware that your body is available as a communication tool. Then you are put in a situation where nothing from the neck down is visible, and you realize that whatever you do physically will not be seen. Everything you have at your disposal is concentrated on your face. What you need to convey must come through your face and eyes,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>Prithviraj further said, &ldquo;None of Kumbha&#39;s emotions is one-dimensional. Everything he does and says carries a great deal of weight from his past, with layers of subtext beneath every line. That complexity is what makes the character so compelling for me, and that is what truly excited me as an actor.&rdquo; The layered writing, he suggested, elevates Kumbha far beyond a conventional antagonist.<br />
<br />
<strong>On working with SS Rajamouli</strong><br />
<br />
The actor also expressed admiration for Rajamouli&rsquo;s meticulous filmmaking approach. &ldquo;I also feel privileged to work with a director who is so clear and laser-focused on how each character should appear on screen. Having such a clutter-free creative surrounding is a blessing for an actor,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Summing up the experience, Prithviraj noted, &ldquo;I am really looking forward to watching the film and seeing more of Kumbha as a character, as it is easily one of the most complex characters I have played. Definitely one of the most complex characters Rajamouli Sir has conceived.&rdquo;<br />

Upon realising that he came without preparation, the actor took a break only to return with a bang. With a National Film Award in his kitty and multiple superhits to his credit, he is touted as one of the big performers in the South Indian film industry. Yes, we are talking about the talented Fahadh Faasil.</p>

<h3><strong>Meet actor Fahadh Faasil</strong></h3>

<p>Born Abdul Hameed Mohammed Fahad Fazil, actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/venkatesh-daggubati-fahadh-faasil-starrer-on-cards-anil-ravipudis-next-film-likely-to-release-on-sankranti-2027-1400455">Fahadh Faasil</a> is the son of popular Indian film director and producer Fazil. At the young age of 20, he decided to step into the acting realm with his father&#39;s romantic film Kaiyethum Doorath (2002). However, the movie didn&rsquo;t succeed in entertaining the audience.</p>

<p>Hence, Fahadh decided to take a seven-year hiatus. During this time, he flew to America to sharpen his skills and complete his education. In 2009, he made a comeback with Kerala Caf&eacute;, a Malayalam-language anthology film starring many biggies. This marked a turning point in his career, making him a household name. From here, there was no stopping.</p>

<p>Then came films like Chaappa Kurishu, Akam, 22 Female Kottayam, Diamond Necklace, Annayum Rasoolum, North 24 Kaatham, and Bangalore Days, all of which made him win multiple accolades. With the mega blockbuster crime-drama film Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum (2017), he took home the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p>

<p>Till now, Fahadh has shared screen with multiple biggies, including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/rajinikanth-x-kamal-haasan-film-to-be-slice-of-life-project-about-friendship-all-we-know-about-its-plot-1400548">Kamal Haasan</a>, Vijay Sethupathi, Allu Arjun, Rajinikanth, Amitabh Bachchan, Nayanthara, Sivakarthikeyan, Vadivelu, and many more. Currently, the audience is looking forward to watching him play a villain in Mammootty and Mohanlal&rsquo;s Patriot. During a recent event, Fahadh revealed that the sequel to his 2024 action-comedy film, Aavesham, is underway. In <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/aavesham-2-update-fahadh-faasil-reveals-sequel-out-in-2027-or-2028-actor-to-play-villain-in-mammoottys-patriot-1400573">Aavesham 2</a>, he is expected to reprise his role as gangster Ranga, wreaking havoc in Bengaluru.</p>

<p>From losing hope after the failure of his debut film to being considered among the finest actors of Indian cinema, Fahadh Faasil&rsquo;s journey in the industry continues to inspire many.</p>

Almost three years after its release, the film&rsquo;s director, Raju Murugan, has finally broken his silence on the movie.</p>

<p><strong>Raju Murugan on Karthi&rsquo;s Japan failure</strong></p>

<p>In a conversation with Sudhir Srinivasan, director Raju Murugan admitted that the film&rsquo;s failure was entirely his responsibility and also revealed that he had initially wanted to make it as a web series.</p>

<p>The director said, &ldquo;Every movie we make starts with great belief. However, during the process, something happens that leaves it undercooked. Something went wrong while cooking in Japan. I must add that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/what-is-tamil-cinemas-identity-karthi-sparks-debate-ahead-of-vaa-vaathiyaar-release-1399016">Karthi</a> sir was always with me while making the film. He was very supportive as an artist and wholeheartedly agreed to experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added, &ldquo;When he came on board, I was the one who had thoughts of adding more elements. Initially, I wanted to make the project an eight-episode web series. The producers read the story and suggested that we make it as a film instead, and that is how it became a film script.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Concluding his statement, the filmmaker reiterated that the film&rsquo;s failure was his fault, saying, &ldquo;I say this repeatedly, Japan is completely Raju Murugan&rsquo;s fault. I don&rsquo;t blame anyone else. I wanted to make something else, but during the process, I couldn&rsquo;t make&nbsp;it the way I intended, and that was my fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/japan-movie-review-karthi-starrer-rides-on-his-shoulder-but-doesnt-offer-much-of-anything-else-1257717">Japan</a> is a heist action comedy starring Karthi in the lead role. The film follows the story of Japan Muni, a thief who steals jewels and uses his fortune. However, as his deeds catch up with him, the man, who is also revealed to be dying from a fatal disease, gets into a cat-and-mouse chase with the police, leading to utter chaos.</p>

<p>Apart from Karthi, the film also stars Anu Emmanuel, Sunil, Vagai Chandrasekhar, KS Ravikumar, Jithan Ramesh, and others in key roles. The movie is currently available for streaming on Netflix.</p>

<p><strong>Karthi&rsquo;s upcoming film</strong></p>

<p>Karthi is next set to hit the big screens with his spy action thriller <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-karthi-and-malavika-mohanan-take-on-a-massive-real-mid-air-fight-scene-in-sardar-2-1400132">Sardar 2</a>.
