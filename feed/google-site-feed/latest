It has been reported that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/who-are-rinku-singhs-parents-all-about-khanchand-singh-and-bina-devi-who-shaped-the-cricketers-life-1398059">Khanchand Singh</a> suffered from stage 4 liver cancer and passed away while undergoing treatment at the Yatharth Hospital in Greater Noida. After a prolonged fight against the disease, the former LPG Cylinder deliveryman breathed his last, prompting his son to fly back from Chennai to his family at this time of difficulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Indian cricketer Rinku Singh&rsquo;s father breathes his last at UP hospital</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/rinku-singhs-ipl-salary-has-gone-from-55-lakh-to-13-crore-know-if-he-is-richer-than-wife-to-be-priya-saroj-1390958">Rinku Singh</a> has returned to be with his family in Aligarh following the passing of his father this morning, as per a Hindustan Times report. The cricketer had previously flown back to Greater Noida to check on Khanchand Singh&rsquo;s health, but decided to return to the Indian camp for their match against Zimbabwe as a part of the ongoing Super 8 series. His condition did not improve much, and he had to be put on ventilator support earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Former Indian cricket player Harbhajan Singh shared his condolences via a post on his X on Friday morning, writing, &ldquo;Pained to learn about the demise of Shri Khanchand Singh Ji, father of Rinku Singh. This must be an especially difficult time for Rinku and his family, even as he remains committed to his responsibilities during the T20 World Cup.<br />
My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones. May Waheguru grant eternal peace to the departed soul and give strength and courage to the bereaved family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Rinku Singh did return to the Indian cricket team for the latest match on Thursday, he was not allowed to be a part of the playing XI, and Sanju Samson replaced him. However, he was pulled in as a substitute fielder after Abhishek Sharma was taken aside for treatment.</p>

<p>Rinku Singh has not been able to perform during the ongoing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/is-marriage-on-the-cards-for-ishan-kishan-and-girlfriend-aditi-hundia-amid-t20-world-cup-heres-what-we-know-1400813">T20 World Cup</a> and has managed to score only 24 runs in 5 innings. It is not known whether he will join the squad for the upcoming match against West Indies on Sunday in Kolkata, and if he will be made to be a part of the playing XI.&nbsp;</p>

The military action drama dropped by 65 percent from the previous week. That said, the movie is now running in its final legs.</p>

Currently standing at Rs. 305.45 crore, the war action drama is all set to face The Kerala Story 2 from the coming weekend. It might see some spike and then march towards its final target at the box office, which is expected to be around Rs. 306 crore to Rs. 308 crore nett.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Border 2 emerged as 2026&#39;s first Clean Hit film. At one point, achieving Super Hit or Blockbuster verdict was in its radar, however, the movie couldn&#39;t see the kind of momentum it needed on weekdays. Nevertheless, Border 2 turned out to be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sunny-deol-opens-up-about-salman-khans-close-bond-with-him-and-dharmendra-i-think-much-before-we-1381450">Sunny Deol</a>&#39;s second highest grossing film and the career-best for the rest of the cast.&nbsp;</p>

That said, the movie is heading towards its theatrical end soon.&nbsp;</p>

The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein&nbsp;is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

The movie added Rs. 50 lakh to the tally on its Day 7, bringing the total cume to Rs. 6.50 crore in its opening week. </p>

<p>The courtroom drama, directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-and-anubhav-sinhas-film-nears-rs-5-cr-in-4-days-1401001">Anubhav Sinha</a>, met with majorly positive reception, it still couldn't post the kind of growth it needed in its first week.

It is a tattoo of Tejasswi&#39;s face, but it is not a permanent one.&rdquo; He further mentioned that it&rsquo;s actually for promoting Tejasswi&#39;s show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is me showing support for her. The event was actually the launch of the show, and the character in the show gets a tattoo of her face. Hence, I put it on. But it&rsquo;s not a real tattoo,&rdquo; he clarified.</p>

She set up dual homes, one in Mumbai and one in the US, for global prospects, which have now paid off. There have always been <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-didnt-want-to-leave-bollywood-says-she-was-pushed-because-of-limitations-in-hindi-films-1400919">questions about her exit</a> and recent decision to return, and in a recent chat with Jay Shetty, the actress has opened up on feeling &lsquo;cornered&rsquo; in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p><strong>Priyanka Chopra recalls feeling the difficulty of survival in Bollywood</strong></p>

<p>Sharing how &lsquo;fleeting&rsquo; the connections can be in the business, she said, &quot;Surviving in the movie industry is tough for everyone; it is not an easy place. It is political, networky, it is about the moment.&quot; She opened up about being at a point where things were not the best, &quot;I did feel like I was in a place where I was cornered...work was limited...in order to survive emotionally... I just needed to move.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, deciding to move was the only option she had, and she felt that shifting to a different country would provide her with solutions. Being in Bollywood only would stagnate her options, which is not what she wanted, and&nbsp;she shared, &quot;I was in this place where I was doing good work, but didn&#39;t see the longevity that I wanted.&quot;</p>

<p>However, working abroad was different as meeting up with foreign musicians felt transformative for the star, making her feel &lsquo;blown away&rsquo;. She added, &ldquo;By being in the studio with will.i.am, Pitbull... It was such a welcome change. It was a breath of fresh air.&quot; And that allowed her to come out of the box of only acting and try something new. She added, &quot;I was feeling like I was drowning, and I was suddenly pulled out, and I could breathe.&quot;</p>

With its global fame, the K-drama spawned a spin-off called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hospital-playlists-jo-jung-suk-jeon-mi-do-jung-kyung-ho-and-more-lend-their-voices-to-resident-playbook-ost-1378926">Resident Playbook</a>, where the original show&rsquo;s cast members had cameos, which was released in 2025. However, the desire for a return of the 99ers gang has long been awaited. Now, actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/connection-starring-ji-sung-and-jeon-mi-do-know-where-to-watch-release-date-time-plot-cast-and-more-1308088">Jeon Mi Do</a>, who plays Chae Song Hwa, has spilled that season 3 may happen sooner than we expected.</p>

<p><strong>Jeon Mi Do shares the Hospital Playlist cast&rsquo;s desire for season 3 and the makers&rsquo; promise</strong></p>

<p>In a chat with Woman Donga, Jeon Mi Do spoke about the undying wish fans as well as the cast members have for a return of the show. She revealed how the conversation is not ending for the actors and the creators as well, who have long been pestered about it, saying, &ldquo;The director (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-hospital-playlist-season-3-happen-anytime-soon-director-shin-won-ho-says-fan-pressure-is-affecting-plans-1382726">Shin Won Ho</a>) and writer (Lee Woo Jung) promised, &#39;We&#39;ll do it within five years.&rsquo; We always talk about it in our group chat. We&#39;re all eagerly awaiting it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding how the one part she&rsquo;s excited about, remains the love line between herself and the character played by Jo Jung Suk, she shared, &ldquo;I&#39;m also very curious to see what kind of doctor Song Hwa will be with [Lee] Ik Jun.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing the fans directly, she expressed hopeful words, &ldquo;I hope that if you just trust me and wait a little longer, there will be good news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lot remains to be explored with the characters in the show, including the love stories of many couples. From all five original cast members finding their partners by the end of season 2 to their juniors getting involved more in their lives, &nbsp;a glimpse was shared during their appearances on Resident Playbook starring Go Yoon Jung, Shin Si Ah, Kang You Seok, Han Ye Ji, and Jung Joon Won.</p>

Appearing on the Jay Shetty Podcast, Priyanka described the period as a &ldquo;personally traumatic time,&rdquo; recalling the emotional strain she and husband <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/nick-jonas-is-beyond-proud-of-wife-priyanka-chopra-for-leading-and-producing-the-bluff-more-in-awe-of-you-1400879">Nick Jonas</a> experienced while their newborn was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The actress revealed that the initial days were filled with uncertainty, fear, and helplessness as they navigated hospital protocols and fragile hope.<br />
<br />
<strong>Priyanka Chopra recalls daughter Malt&#39;s birth</strong><br />
<br />
Sharing a deeply personal memory, Priyanka said, &ldquo;We went with her to the NICU. One of us was allowed at a time, and she cried the first time. It was like a cat (makes a sound like a kitten). That&#39;s all we got. My mom and in-laws flew down, but we were in the hospital. It was such a personally traumatic time. But somehow, because we were in and out of the hospital, I remember it leaked and we got a text saying that her birth is gonna be put out by the papers, that if we don&#39;t, they are going to in three hours. So we were kind of forced into announcing her birth. We wanted to hold onto our own narrative of it; we weren&#39;t ready because we didn&#39;t know what would happen with her or how she would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For nearly three months, the couple paused all professional commitments to remain by Malti&rsquo;s side. Priyanka revealed, &ldquo;Nick would sing to her on his guitar. I used to have this little iPod which played all my mantras, my Mahamrityunjay Mantra, my Gayatri Mantra, my Om Namah Shiv mantra, all of it would play all day inside her crib softly. There were a lot of people praying for her. She was very very desired, very coveted, and treasured. It was so hard, her journey to get to this planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Priyanka and Nick got married in 2018 in Rajasthan in both Hindu and Christian ceremonies. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-calls-nick-jonas-best-decision-i-ever-made-in-romantic-update-shares-unseen-early-relationship-pics-1400530">The couple</a>&nbsp;welcomed Malti in January 2022. Since then, they have largely maintained privacy around her life, occasionally sharing glimpses.</p>

Though the drop isn&#39;t big but it is coming from an already low figure, so that doesn&#39;t make any cut. Estimates suggest that the movie collected Rs. 45 lakh on Day 6, bringing the cume to Rs. 5.60 crore nett at the Indian box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Co-starring&nbsp;Kani Kusruti, Revathy, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, the courtroom drama will face <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-dhurandhar-the-revenge-final-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-1401024">The Kerala Story 2</a> from the coming weekend. Since the movie has recieved a favourable word-of-mouth, it should see a spike on the second weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the major factors why the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-drops-on-day-3-wraps-opening-weekend-at-rs-4-10-crore-1400969">Taapsee Pannu</a> film isn&#39;t gaining the required traction is lack of interest among the audience. The movie had lowkey promotions, which also affected its box office potential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, audience now has a notion of considering such films as OTT movies, as they have now build enough patience to wait for movies&#39; digital release. The stakeholders needs to disrupt this patience and elongate the OTT window to somewhere around 6 months, otherwise the business of such small/mid-sized film is already dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The previous collaboration between Anubhav Sinha and Taapsee Pannu was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Assi Box Office Collections: Taapsee Pannu starrer drops on Day 3, wraps opening weekend at Rs 4.10 crore ','1400969','https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-drops-on-day-3-wraps-opening-weekend-at-rs-4-10-crore-1400969','Thappad','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Thappad</a>, which debuted with Rs. 2.75&nbsp;crore and went on to collect Rs. 13.50&nbsp;crore nett in its opening weekend. Thappad eventually recovered its cost of production and ended its theatrical run around Rs. 30 crore nett, which would be considered as a good outcome for a film like this in today&#39;s scenario.&nbsp;</p>

During these testing times, Salman Khan and his family received support from his friends in the industry. Among them was Aamir Khan, who paid a visit to the senior star. Soon after, during his interaction with the media, Aamir confirmed that Salim Khan&rsquo;s health is improving.</p>

<h3><strong>Aamir Khan gives an update about Salim Khan&rsquo;s health</strong></h3>

<p>Days after <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salim-khan-hospitalization-salman-khans-father-out-of-danger-after-surgery-confirms-former-co-star-daisy-shah-1401057">Salim Khan</a> was rushed to Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai, on February 17, 2026, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salim-khan-hospitalized-aamir-khan-arrives-with-partner-gauri-spratt-at-the-hospital-to-check-on-the-legend-1400900">Aamir Khan</a> went to meet the family and the ailing screenwriter with his partner, Gauri Spratt. But since the veteran writer was in the ICU, Aamir couldn&rsquo;t meet him personally. But he has been constantly in touch with the Khans and taking and update about their father&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>While talking to the media recently, the Dangal actor revealed, &ldquo;Main Salim sahab se milne gaya tha, hum sab dua kar rahe hai ke woh jaldi se achche hojaye. Woh ICU mein the, toh main unse personally nahi mil paaya, lekin main unki family ke saath mein baitha tha (I went to meet Salim Sahib. We are all praying for his speedy recovery. He was in the ICU, so I couldn&#39;t meet him in person, but I sat with his family).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aamir further added that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khan-and-family-displeased-by-health-update-on-salim-khan-they-want-to-avoid-1400909">Salman Khan</a>&rsquo;s sister Alvira Khan Agnihotri informed him, &ldquo;Har roz ke unki health improve ho rahi hai (Every day, his health is improving.)&rdquo; Aamir concluded that they are praying that Salim Khan&nbsp;gets well soon and returns home as soon as possible.</p>

<p><strong>About Salim Khan&rsquo;s hospitalisation</strong></p>

<p>The day he was hospitalized, the doctors saw him in the casualty department, after which he was taken to the ICU. A doctor later informed the media that Salim Khan was having jerks, and his blood pressure was high. Since they wanted to do certain investigations on him, they put him on the ventilator. Later, a Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) procedure was performed by a neurosurgeon on the veteran writer, after which his health was stable,&nbsp;and he was on the road to recovery.</p>

The cop action drama, directed by Abhiraj Minawala, took its 4th week's cume to Rs. 2.05 crore in 6 days. It is expected to wind around Rs. 2.15 crore, taking the running cume to Rs. 47.50 crore by the end of its Week 4. </p>

<p>Backed by Yash Raj Films, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-recalls-national-award-win-alongside-shah-rukh-khan-hum-dono-bachchon-ke-tarah-the-1400313">Rani Mukerji</a> starrer is looking to wind its entire run somewhere around Rs. 50 crore nett at the Indian box office. It will be a good outcome for the film as the theatrical business has gone down drastically in the post-pandemic era, with the rise of OTT in India.</p>

<p>The movie turned out to be the highest grossing film of the franchise, surpassing Mardaani 2. It is also the only successful female-led franchise from Hindi cinema. </p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-film-continues-decent-run-nets-1-75cr-on-2nd-friday-1400535">Mardaani 3</a> has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more updates. </p>

The Jaspal Singh Sandhu directorial debuted with Rs. 50 lakh on Day 1 and went on to collect around Rs. 3.05 crore in its opening week. Furthermore, the movie witnessed a massive drop in the second week, when it minted just Rs. 25 lakh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Since then, it only could add around Rs. 5 lakh more to the tally, bringing its entire cume to Rs. 3.35 crore nett (Rs. 4 crore gross) at the Indian box office. Considering the cast, budget, and scale of the movie, Vadh 2 performed well. However, it should have recorded a much better theatrical run, if the movie had received audience support and better showcasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The original film had collected just Rs. 65 lakh in its entire run. Compared to which, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/vadh-2-box-office-collections-week-2-sanjay-mishra-neena-gupta-film-adds-rs-25-lakh-targets-rs-3-50-cr-finish-1400923">Vadh 2</a> managed to smash 5 times more. However, the sequel ran in cinemas with an activated Buy-One-Get-One offer, which means the actual earnings will be on the lower side.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Co-starring Kumud Mishra, Amitt Singh, Shilpa Shukla, and others, the crime thriller was released alongwith <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/bhabhi-ji-ghar-par-hain-final-box-office-collections-aasif-sheikh-and-rohitashv-gour-starrer-ends-theatrical-run-at-rs-1-50-crore-turns-a-disaster-1400831">Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hain! Fun On The Roll</a> in cinemas. Though the comedy drama had a strong TV IP attached to it, still Vadh 2 performed far better. This is a win of sorts for the film and deserves acknowledgement. However, some sections of the trade seem unwilling to recognise the value in such results.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">One portal even states that &ldquo;the second part shouldn&rsquo;t really be happening.&rdquo; A film with no face value has done more than five times the business of its predecessor, albeit at a low level of business, which clearly indicates some appreciation. Dismissing its existence outright is myopic. Moreover, at a time when the industry routinely struggles with a lack of releases for several weeks in a year, discouraging films that are at least finding some audience is counterproductive. Beyond box office mathematics, filmmaking is fundamentally an art form, and the idea of suppressing films solely because they do not cater to mass audiences is deeply flawed.</p>

<p>Backed by JP Films and T-Series Films, the military action drama is now running in its final legs at the ticket window. It is expected to wrap its entire run around Rs. 306 crore to Rs. 308 crore nett mark, depending on how the movie performs in its 6th week, against <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-dhurandhar-the-revenge-final-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-1401024">The Kerala Story&nbsp;2</a> and Tere Naam&#39;s re-release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sunny Deol starrer performed well on weekends but remained ordinary on the weekdays, which is why, it is ending its entire run far behind Deol&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/decoding-the-economics-of-gadar-2-sunny-deol-starrer-budget-recovery-verdict-and-lifetime-box-office-1244895">Gadar 2</a>.

As per estimates, the movie collected Rs. 1 crore yesterday, bringing the second week&#39;s cume to Rs. 11 crore in 6 days. It is looking to close this week at Rs. 12 crore, which will take its running cume of 14-days closer to Rs. 55 crore nett mark.</p>

<p>Based on the current trends, the romantic action drama is heading to wind its entire theatrical run somewhere around Rs. 60 crore or so. This isn&#39;t a good total for such a big-budgeted movie, thus, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/oromeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-and-tripti-dimri-starrer-collects-rs-1-25-crore-on-2nd-tuesday-cume-hits-rs-52-crore-in-12-days-1401032">O&#39;Romeo</a>&nbsp;is heading towards a disappointing end.</p>

The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

As the duo steps into a committed relationship, there was a time a couple of years ago when their relationship was almost revealed by Ranbir Kapoor.</p>

<p><strong>When Ranbir Kapoor almost spilled the relationship between Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna</strong></p>

<p>In an episode of Unstoppable with NBK, hosted by Nandamuri Balakrishna, the Animal leads, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-ranbir-kapoors-valentines-tease-has-internet-guessing-about-his-one-wish-1400721">Ranbir Kapoor</a> and Rashmika Mandanna, appeared to promote the film along with director Sandeep Reddy Vanga.</p>

<p>During the show, the topic shifted to Arjun Reddy, and NBK asked Rashmika whether she had any connection to the film. In response, the actress did not elaborate on her personal life and instead mentioned that it was the first film she watched after moving to Hyderabad.</p>

<p>However, Ranbir Kapoor added more spice to the conversation, saying, &ldquo;There is a coincidence here. Sandeep met Rashmika for the first time at the Arjun Reddy success party, on Vijay&rsquo;s terrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the studio erupted in cheers, Rashmika responded, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary to give all this information.&rdquo;</p>

As the 90-year-old veteran underwent treatment, several celebrities, friends, and family members visited him at the hospital.</p>

<p>Now, Salman&rsquo;s former co-star Daisy Shah has confirmed that the veteran writer is out of danger and has successfully undergone surgery.</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan&rsquo;s father Salim Khan confirmed to be out of danger</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to Filmygyan, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-no-daisy-shah-no-entry-2-salman-khan-anees-bazmee-yet-decide-cast-987747">Daisy Shah</a> said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t meet Salim sir, but I am constantly in touch with Salman sir and his family. Salim sir is fine now. He is stable. The surgery went well; it was a success, and he is under observation. But he is out of danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The veteran screenwriter is currently stable and under close observation in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>

<p>Over the past few days, several family members and industry friends have visited Salim Khan, extending their support to Salman Khan. As per reports, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khan-and-family-displeased-by-health-update-on-salim-khan-they-want-to-avoid-1400909">Salman Khan</a>&#39;s father was admitted to the hospital&rsquo;s ICU and placed on a ventilator as a precautionary measure.

<p>Reportedly, Dr. Jalil Parkar, who is treating the writer, revealed that Khan had suffered a minor haemorrhage. He stated that there had been minimal brain haemorrhage and that a small procedure had been performed that morning, which was successful.</p>

<p>The doctor further said that Salim was fine and stable but was still on a ventilator. He added that they were hopeful of removing him from the ventilator the next day. Overall, he mentioned that Salim was doing quite well. However, he noted that, considering his age, the recovery time would be longer.</p>

They are set to return to the silver screen with a highly anticipated horror-comedy project that promises to revive their signature cinematic magic.</p>

<p><strong>Behind the Scenes: How the Bhooth Bangla title was finalized by Akshay Kumar</strong></p>

<p>The collaboration was initiated by powerhouse producer Ektaa Kapoor, who personally pitched the script to the duo. Veteran director Priyadarshan immediately saw the story&rsquo;s potential and agreed to come on board after adding a few creative tweaks to the narrative.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-did-arshad-warsi-confirm-akshay-kumars-role-in-golmaal-5-actor-reveals-plans-for-asur-season-3-1400947">Akshay Kumar</a> who made the final call on the film&rsquo;s title, opting to change the original working title to the catchier Bhooth Bangla.</p>

<p>Promising a masterful blend of laugh-out-loud comedy, spine-tingling horror, and gripping thrills, the film is deliberately designed to remind fans of their 2007 cult classic, Bhool Bhulaiyaa. A recently released teaser perfectly captures this energetic vibe, showcasing Akshay Kumar having an absolute blast while navigating the spooky, chaotic antics of a haunted house.</p>

<p><strong>Ektaa Kapoor&#39;s Vision: A &quot;Wild Gujarati Thali&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/heer-ranjha-imtiaz-ali-reunites-with-ektaa-kapoor-for-new-film-expands-laila-majnu-franchise-1400756">Ektaa Kapoor</a>&nbsp;has a specific demographic in mind for this venture: families and children. Drawing personal inspiration from her own child, she wants the film to be an entertaining, shared experience for audiences of all ages. In an informal chat, she enthusiastically described Bhooth Bangla as a &ldquo;wild Gujarati thali&rdquo;&mdash;a rich, vibrant, and varied mix of comedy, horror, and drama that proudly features the &ldquo;OG&rdquo; masters of the genre.</p>

<p>With an ensemble cast that includes Paresh Rawal, Asrani, Rajpal Yadav, Tabu, Mithila Palkar, and Wamiqa Gabbi, Bhooth Bangla is shaping up to be a wild ride. Pritam&rsquo;s music is set to elevate the film&rsquo;s energy.</p>

<p>The first single from the film, titled Ram Ji Aake Bhala Karenge, has already been announced. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bhooth-bangla-akshay-kumar-vidya-balan-send-special-wishes-to-priyadarshan-for-the-film-as-he-turns-69-video-1400330">Bhooth Bangla</a> is officially slated to release in theatres on April 10, 2026.</p>

<br />
In 2018, during the success meet of Geetha Govindam, the host asked Vijay&rsquo;s parents, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-peek-into-rashmika-mandannas-future-home-vijay-deverakondas-luxurious-rs-15-crore-mansion-in-hyderabad-1401034">Govardhan Rao and Madhavi</a>, about their expectations for their son&rsquo;s marriage. Madhavi shared that she wished for someone who would genuinely love and care for Vijay and understand the demanding nature of his profession in the film industry. Echoing her sentiments, Govardhan Rao said that he wanted his son to marry the person of his choice, irrespective of caste or religion. He added that he would be happy if Vijay married an Indian, preferably a South Indian. Vijay, present at the event, had lightened the moment by reiterating his belief in love marriage, joking that while the choice would be his, his parents would also need to adore the girl.</p>

<p>Over the years, fans closely followed Vijay and Rashmika&rsquo;s bond, strengthened through films like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/virosh-wedding-vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandannas-sangeet-dance-to-have-a-geetha-govindam-link-find-out-1401042">Geetha Govindam</a> and Dear Comrade. During promotions for The Girlfriend, Rashmika hinted at having a partner who helped her heal from past pain, sparking speculation that she was referring to Vijay. Reports later suggested the couple got engaged privately in Hyderabad last October, long before they made their relationship public.<br />

According to coverage, the LAPD and the fire department were called to her house in the Hollywood Hills. Responding to the same, the authorities rushed to the site around 6:40 pm PT and found her deceased. Following this, the 75-year-old actor&rsquo;s The Best of Steve Martin and Martin Short comedy show was canceled via notices on the Milwaukee and Minneapolis locations&rsquo; websites.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Short&rsquo;s family confirms daughter Katherine&rsquo;s demise</strong></p>

<p>As per a note shared with TMZ, the family confirmed the passing of the 42-year-old, &quot;It is with profound grief that we confirm the passing of Katherine Hartley Short. The Short family is devastated by this loss, and asks for privacy at this time. Katherine was beloved by all and will be remembered for the light and joy she brought into the world.&quot;</p>

<p>It is known that Katherine was a social worker based in Los Angeles. She is said to have completed her bachelor&#39;s education from NYU and had a master&#39;s degree from USC, in its social work program.

<p>According to reports, a Haldi ceremony is planned for today (February 25, 2026) at an outdoor area of the luxurious hotel.

The couple that finally announced their relationship alongside their wedding plans for this week showcased a glimpse at their intimate affairs with minimal updates on their Instagram handles. A report from India Today has now claimed that the Animal actress will be gifted a family treasure at their sangeet ceremony.</p>

<p><strong>Rashmika Mandanna gets a grand family welcome from Vijay Deverakonda&rsquo;s mom</strong></p>

<p>A source spoke about Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna&#39;s wedding festivities, sharing how the actor&rsquo;s mother, Deverakonda Madhavi, planned on presenting a set of meaningful jewellery to her would-be daughter-in-law. &ldquo;In a heartfelt gesture, Vijay&rsquo;s mother will present Rashmika with traditional heirloom bangles during the sangeet ceremony, symbolising acceptance, love and family legacy,&rdquo; was reportedly said about the couple&rsquo;s celebrations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the couple, the guests, and their families gear up for the ceremony at the ITC Mementos hotel, Udaipur, fans have been cheering on for the pair loudly. The duo was rumored to be in a relationship for many years before finally confirming it earlier on Sunday. They have been sharing tiny sneak peeks of the celebrations on their social media accounts, including a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/virosh-wedding-vijay-deverakonda-and-rashmika-mandanna-indulge-in-fun-cricket-match-before-tying-the-knot-1401022">cricket match</a> moment following <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-rashmika-mandanna-vijay-deverakonda-kickoff-wedding-festivities-with-celebratory-dinner-and-water-volleyball-pics-1401003">water volleyball and a welcome dinner</a> with indulgent Japanese cuisine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna are all set to marry in a private affair on February 26, 2026, in Udaipur, with a limited guestlist. Meanwhile, a separate reception will be held back home for their industry colleagues and friends back home in Hyderabad on March 4.</p>

<p>Following their work in Geetha Govindam back in 2018, the couple reunited for Dear Comrade in 2019, and the dating rumors have followed them since. They were spotted going on a vacation to Rome earlier this year and have announced their official couple name as Virosh.</p>

The drop is very disappointing as the movie should have record a spike ideally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The courtroom drama collected Rs. 50 lakh on its Day 5, bringing its total cume to Rs. 5.15 crore nett at the Indian box office. It is expected to wind its first week around Rs. 6 crore nett or so. The way Assi is performing, it&#39;s nothing but disappointing. Since the movie has received mainly positive word-of-mouth, it still didn&#39;t see any sort of growth at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the movie continues with the same pace, it will only tank at the box office, emerging another failure this year. One of the major reasons why <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-and-anubhav-sinhas-film-nears-rs-5-cr-in-4-days-1401001">Assi </a>isn&#39;t picking up is the lack of awareness around its release, as the promotional strategy was very lukewarm.</p>

<p>Furthermore, audience now has a notion of considering such films as OTT movies, as they have now build enough patience to wait for movies&#39; digital release. The stakeholders needs to disrupt this patience and elongate the OTT window to somewhere around 6 months, otherwise the business of such small/mid-sized film is already dying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how far the latest <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/taapsee-pannu-gets-real-about-the-negative-side-of-pr-you-pay-to-push-yourself-and-to-push-someone-else-down-1399860">Taapsee Pannu</a> film can go at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

It will be a good outcome for the film as the theatrical business has gone down drastically in the post-pandemic era, with the rise of OTT in India.</p>

<p>In fact, big-budget movies starring A-listers are also struggling to find the audience. In such times, if a female-led film managed to recover its cost of production, its a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mardaani 3 has surpassed the lifetime earnings of Mardaani 2 already.

<p>The military action drama collected Rs. 30 lakh on its 5th Tuesday, registering a nominal jump over the previous day. The 5th week's cume has now reached Rs. 2.80 crore nett, which took its 37-day cume to slightly over the Rs. 305 crore nett at the Indian box office. </p>

The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/hrithik-roshan-reviews-actor-hails-shahid-kapoors-performance-in-oromeo-you-do-this-genre-1400904">Shahid Kapoor</a> and Triptii Dimri starrer collected Rs.1.25 crore nett on Tuesday, bringing the second week&#39;s cume to Rs. 10 crore nett in 5 days.</p>

<p>Allied to its Rs. 42 crore of first week, the total cume of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-triptii-dimri-film-makes-it-past-rs-50-cr-net-in-india-1401002">O&#39;Romeo</a> reached Rs. 52 crore nett in its 12 days of theatrical run. It is expected to hit the Rs. 55 crore mark by the end of this week. The movie will face competition from The Kerala Story 2 from the coming weekend and then the next two weeks are clear run. That said, the Shahid Kapoor movie can stick to the cinemas until <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-dhurandhar-the-revenge-final-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-1401024">Dhurandhar 2 and Toxic</a> arrives.</p>

<p>Based on the current trends, the Vishal Bharadwaj directorial is heading to wind its entire theatrical run around Rs. 60 crore nett at the Indian box office, which is not a good total for such a well-budgeted movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not that it changes anything for the film, just that, at one point, even reaching Rs. 50 crore nett felt like an improbable task, but aided by BOGO offers and this open run, it has gotten there and some more. The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna are all set to tie the knot soon and were recently spotted arriving in Udaipur. The duo had apparently hosted a celebratory evening for their friends, with the wedding festivities set to begin shortly.</p>

<p>After years of dating rumors, Vijay and Rashmika made their relationship official through a post on their social media handles. The couple revealed their wedding title, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/wedding-of-virosh-rashmika-mandanna-vijay-deverakonda-to-start-pre-wedding-rituals-with-mehendi-sangeet-haldi-1401004">VIROSH</a>,&rdquo; expressing their love and gratitude to fans and well-wishers.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Vijay and Rashmika have been dating for several years. The couple is now set to tie the knot in an intimate ceremony on February 26, with a reception expected to take place in Hyderabad on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p>Earlier, Vijay and Rashmika also shared a glimpse of their pre-wedding activities, where they were seen enjoying a cricket match.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Rashmika is reportedly set to be part of AA22xA6, starring Allu Arjun and directed by Atlee. The upcoming film is also expected to feature Deepika Padukone as a co-lead, with rumors suggesting that Arjun may play multiple roles.</p>

<p>Apart from Nani, actors Raghav Juyal, Mohan Babu, Tanikella Bharani, Sonali Kulkarni, Sampoornesh Babu, Eeshwari Rao, and others play key roles in the film.</p>

<p>Earlier, the movie was set to clash in theatres with Peddi, as both films were eyeing a March 2026 release. However, after the Ram Charan starrer was postponed to April, the Nani-led film also moved from its previous date.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Entering the Pinkvilla Predicts tracking this week is the highly anticipated Dhurandhar: The Revenge. This also marks the final update for The Kerala Story 2: Goes Beyond.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dhurandhar: The Revenge (19/03/2026)</strong><br />
First Day Box Office Forecast: Rs. 67-77 crore</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Dhurandhar: The Revenge or Dhurandhar 2 is the most anticipated Bollywood film in recent times, probably since Dhoom 3. The original <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/decoding-economics-of-dhurandhar-ranveer-singh-film-generates-300-crore-profits-1400454">Dhurandhar</a>, released in December 2025, was a <em>box office dhurandhar</em>, which had a glorious run and went on to become the biggest Hindi film of all time. It has continued its record-breaking journey beyond theatrically as well, amassing record views for an Indian film on Netflix.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The film has no fresh marketing material out yet, but it doesn&rsquo;t even really matter, as the first part itself was a trailer for it. It could practically release tomorrow and will still open to historic numbers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The record for the highest opening day for a Hindi film is held by Jawan at Rs. 64 crore nett. Releasing on Eid holiday, Dhurandhar 2 would comfortably cross that and will set new benchmarks for the Hindi film industry. Had it been a solo release, it would be expected to clear Rs. 70 crore nett and Rs. 80 crore nett mark, possibly even Rs. 90 crore nett, but that is unfortunately not the case as the film is slated to clash with Yash starrer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-toxic-hindi-trailer-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-final-update-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-1400833">Toxic</a>, which will cause a loss of capacity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If it were a solo release, the forecast for the film would have been around Rs. 80-90 crore, but considering the clash, it is starting at Rs. 67-77 crore. In this range, the scope for upside is more, with the pinpoint forecast closer to the higher end. With more clarity on showcasing, as we get closer to release, the forecast may be increased.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Other Updates</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Kerala Story 2</strong> remains a tricky title to predict for all the factors explained previously. The forecast remains unchanged at Rs. 3-7 crore.&nbsp;</p>

Here's what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/155841812_rajini-cibi-webp.webp"></img><p>Superstar Rajinikanth is currently working on his next release, Jailer 2, directed by Nelson Dilipkumar. Now, it appears that after wrapping up work on the sequel, the actor may begin work on Thalaivar173 in April 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Rajinikanth to begin shooting for Thalaivar173 in April 2026</strong></p>

<p>Speaking at the Thaai Kizhavi pre-release event, director Cibi Chakaravarthi attended the function to support the film and its team. During the event, the filmmaker was asked when he would begin shooting for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/thalaivar-173-cibi-chakaravarthi-comes-onboard-as-director-in-kamal-haasan-rajinikanth-starrer-after-sundar-cs-exit-calls-it-dream-come-true-1399612">Thalaivar173</a>, to which he revealed that the team is planning to take the film on floors in April 2026.</p>

<p>As per online reports, the movie&rsquo;s shoot is likely to continue until September this year, with a prominent Malayalam actor playing the co-lead role. With the film aiming for a Pongal 2027 release, reports suggest that it will be a family entertainer with fun elements.</p>

<p>Earlier, the superstar himself had also revealed plans to begin shooting his next film in April, underlining that it would be a &ldquo;proper entertainer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The upcoming movie is being co-produced by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/khxrk-promo-out-rajinikanth-and-kamal-haasan-reunite-after-47-years-for-nelsons-actioner-filming-starts-soon-1400943">Kamal Haasan</a> under the banner of Raaj Kamal Films International (RKFI). Initially, the team had planned to collaborate with director Sundar C; however, he later opted out of the project due to prior commitments, leading Cibi Chakaravarthi to take over the responsibility.</p>

The drop from Sunday is about 40 percent, which means, the movie is holding decently. The 4th week&#39;s cume now stands at Rs. 1.60 crore in 4 days and it is expected to wind around 2.50 crore or so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backed by Yash Raj Films, the cop action drama has reached Rs. 47 crore in 29 days of its theatrical run. Mardaani 3 is now taking its last few breaths at the box office and is looking to wind its entire theatrical run around Rs. 50 crore nett mark, which will be a good total for a female-led film in the post-COVID times, when the theatrical business has gone down drastically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mardaani 3 is now the biggest grosser of its franchise, surpassing Mardaani 2&#39;s Rs. 46.30 crore of lifetime earnings. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-says-salman-khan-got-heart-of-gold-credits-khan-trio-for-her-bollywood-journey-1400317">Rani Mukerji</a> starrer also emerged as the only successful female-led franchise from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-india-box-office-collections-4th-weekend-rani-mukerjis-cop-drama-emerges-franchises-biggest-grosser-surpasses-mardaani-2-1400982">Mardaani 3</a>&nbsp;has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

<p>The running cume of the Sunny Deol starrer now stands at Rs. 304.85 crore nett. It will cross the Rs. 305 crore mark tomorrow and then will march towards its final target.

Among the many composers and producers who have worked with the group on the album previously, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/arirang-diplo-confirms-work-on-bts-album-is-his-biggest-work-yet-says-it-will-shock-the-world-1400578">Diplo confirmed his contribution</a>, and now, OneRepublic&rsquo;s Ryan Tedder has chimed in about it being a &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; thing in his own career.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>After Diplo, Ryan Tedder calls the BTS album one of his biggest works done</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the crowd during the group&rsquo;s set for the OneRepublic From Asia, With Love 2026 in Seoul concert, he spoke about how he has two jobs, one in his own group and one back in the studio with many artists. Ryan Tedder then said, &ldquo;Most recently, I did a lot of work on the upcoming BTS album,&rdquo; earning loud cheers from them. Asking attendees whether they wanted to hear more, he said, and started off by building hype around his work with the septet, &quot;Working on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-if-theyll-submit-arirang-for-grammy-rm-reacts-to-k-pop-nods-dont-want-to-be-desperately-1400723">BTS</a>&#39; new album is truly amazing... You&#39;ll probably love it.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to share his praise for the group and their work, &quot;I&rsquo;ll say this. It absolutely blew me away how talented they (BTS) were. Honestly, it&#39;s one of the craziest things I&#39;ve ever worked on in my whole career. Ever. It&rsquo;s crazy. I think I know you&#39;re going to love it. So that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say.&rdquo; He then joked, &quot;I think I&#39;ll get in trouble if I say more, so I&#39;ll stop here.&quot;</p>

<p>The man behind contributions to Grammy-winning albums like Adele&#39;s 21 and 25, and Taylor Swift&#39;s 1989, has dipped his toes in the world of K-pop many times before. From BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa&#39;s ROCKSTAR, TWICE&#39;s CRY FOR ME, TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s Back for More and Do It Like That, and he has even worked on BTS&rsquo; Jimin&#39;s Be Mine. With many hits under his own group, the One Republic star managed to raise the stakes for the upcoming album even further.</p>

<p>BTS will release their 5th full-length album ARIRANG on March 20, 2026.</p>

<p>Vijay continued, &ldquo;I want to make sure he remains alive even while working with Mani Ratnam. When I entered the industry, all I wanted was to stand in front of the camera and deliver my dialogue. Even today, I feel so alive when I&rsquo;m in front of the camera.&rdquo;</p>

Their return signals more than nostalgia; it restores the emotional core that has shaped the slasher saga for decades. As Sidney Prescott and Gale Weathers, the duo has anchored the series through shifting timelines, rising body counts, and evolving horror tropes. It is a powerful continuation of one of horror&rsquo;s most iconic female dynamics.<br />
<br />
<strong>Courteney Cox and&nbsp;Neve Campbell reunite for Scream 7</strong><br />
<br />
For Courteney Cox, stepping back into Gale&rsquo;s shoes alongside Campbell felt instinctive. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long, it seems like we grew up together. Gale and Sidney will always have some issues, but working together is the most comfortable thing in the world for us. It&rsquo;s the way it should be,&rdquo; she said. Their off-screen familiarity continues to fuel the layered tension and loyalty that defines their on-screen characters.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/6-hollywood-theatrical-releases-this-week-feb-23-28-2026-from-scream-7-to-epic-elvis-presley-in-concert-1400988?amp">Neve Campbell</a> echoed&nbsp;the sentiment, reflecting on how the characters&rsquo; bond has matured. &ldquo;Their love-hate relationship has always been a lot of fun. We get to see more of that this time as they become even closer. Gale brings so much humor to these films and Courteney adds an important layer of humanity to her,&rdquo; she said. The evolving camaraderie promises emotional depth amid the terror.<br />
<br />

Even the smallest of updates are grabbing the audience&rsquo;s attention, and the latest buzz seems to be about the upcoming filming schedule of the film. As reported on February 24, the stars of the SS Rajamouli movie have proceeded to Georgia, where they will shoot &lsquo;crucial&rsquo; sequences as per Gulte. A separate report by Deccan Chronicle has claimed that the director will aim for action scenes between the protagonist and antagonist.</p>

<p><strong>Varanasi begins Georgia filming schedule</strong></p>

<p>In the early hours of Tuesday morning, superstar Mahesh Babu was spotted flying to Georgia as previously rumored. The actor&rsquo;s team accompanied him at the airport as he headed for the next filming location, Georgia. It has been reported that the filmmaker, alongside DOP PS Vinod, previously scouted and fixed the venues for the shoot a couple of months ago, and will now be taking the actors there for a span of 12 to 14 days.</p>

<p>The makers are seemingly aiming to shoot crucial portions of the film during these two weeks. Buzz has claimed that &lsquo;massive action sequences and pivotal scenes&rsquo; starring Mahesh Babu and Prithviraj Sukumaran will be shot during this time. It is not known whether the lead actress, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-priyanka-chopra-jonas-calls-mahesh-babu-starrer-a-career-defining-film-says-ss-rajamouli-is-the-best-in-india-1400872">Priyanka Chopra</a>, will be joining the crew during this leg of the shoot; however, it seems unlikely with her ongoing promotions for The Bluff and the schedule focusing on the two male leads&rsquo; portions.</p>

<p>Helmed by SS Rajamouli, Mahesh Babu will play Rudhra in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/its-official-mahesh-babu-starrer-varanasi-with-ss-rajamouli-to-hit-big-screens-on-april-7-2027-new-look-out-1400342">Varanasi</a>, with some reports suggesting a dual role as Lord Rama or an inspiration angle. Meanwhile, Kumbha will be Prithviraj Sukumaran&rsquo;s wheelchair-bound character. Priyanka Chopra has been roped in for the role of Mandakini.</p>

<p>Varanasi is expected to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-update-ss-rajamouli-confirms-mahesh-babus-movie-to-wrap-up-shoot-by-june-2026-1400722">wrap filming by June</a>&nbsp;this year and then focus on the post-production work, including enormous VFX editing and more. The film has already announced its April 7, 2027, release date and previously held a big title reveal event at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.</p>

<p>On February 23, 2026, local time, it was confirmed that Robert Carradine passed away via a note from his family to Deadline. The actor was known for his work in projects like The Long Riders, Revenge of the Nerds, and most prominently, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/10-actresses-who-made-powerful-comebacks-after-break-from-drew-barrymore-to-jennifer-lopez-1389848">Lizzie McGuire</a>. His demise has invited tributes from fellow co-stars and many who crossed paths with him during his long career.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robert Carradine passes away, family note confirms</strong></p>

<p>The family of the star shared the confirmation as follows, &ldquo;It is with profound sadness that we must share that our beloved father, grandfather, uncle, and brother Robert Carradine has passed away. In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon on light to everyone around him. We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby&rsquo;s valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with Bipolar Disorder. We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness. At this time we ask for the privacy to grieve this unfathomable loss. With gratitude for your understanding and compassion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, his on-screen daughter, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/hilary-duff-plastic-surgery-1251030">Hilary Duff</a>, who played the titular character on Lizzie McGuire,&nbsp;took to her social media to share her sorrow, &ldquo;This one hurts. It&rsquo;s really hard to face this reality about an old friend. There was so much warmth in the McGuire family ,and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. I&rsquo;ll be forever grateful for that. I&rsquo;m deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other actors on the show also remembered the late star for his talent. &ldquo;My heart hurts today. I was fortunate to know Bobby for most of my life. And he was one of the coolest guys you could ever meet. Funny, pragmatic, sometimes cranky, always a little eccentric,&rdquo; said Jake Thomas. He recalled their fond memories on the set and praised his acting, music, and directing skills.</p>

<p>Lalaine, who played Miranda Sanchez, spoke about how unfair it was, &ldquo;I am thankful tho. (though) Thankful I had time with you, thankful for our last conversation, and your constant fatherly like support. I love you Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Carradine is survived by his three children, Ever Carradine with Susan Snyder, Marika Reed Carradine, and Ian Alexander Carradine, with ex-wife Edie Mani. He was the son of prolific actor John Carradine and followed his family&rsquo;s footsteps into the acting world.&nbsp;</p>

After the war, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna with the responsibility of protecting Lord Vishnu&rsquo;s final avatar when the time comes.</p>

<p>Six thousand years later, in 2898 AD, the world has transformed into a harsh dystopia ruled through fear by a self-proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to appease him in hopes of gaining access to his abundant land, known as the Complex, others rise in rebellion against his tyranny.</p>

<p>As hope begins to fade, a new light emerges in the form of an unborn child carried by SUM-80, also known as Sumathi. With Yaskin and his followers determined to extract the child&rsquo;s life force, an epic tale unfolds, setting the stage for the rest of the saga.</p>

<p>The first installment starred <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-on-how-he-wishes-to-do-more-films-for-fans-but-only-2-will-be-arriving-this-year-3-movies-were-to-release-1400932">Prabhas</a> in the lead role and also featured Amitabh Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, and Kamal Haasan in prominent roles. As Deepika has reportedly opted out of the project, rumors suggest that Sai Pallavi may replace her in the sequel.</p>

After months of speculation around their relationship, secret engagement, and upcoming nuptials, the two finally confirmed that they&rsquo;ll be getting married via a note to their fans. Announcing the &lsquo;Wedding of VIROSH,&rsquo; the couple is gearing up to tie the knot on February 26, 2026. Ahead of the big day, we&rsquo;re taking a look at the details of where it all first began.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong><br />
The duo&rsquo;s first known meeting was for the 2018 film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-rashmika-mandanna-cried-while-filming-geetha-govindam-with-vijay-deverakonda-for-this-reason-1339681">Geetha Govindam</a>. They began shooting for the same back in 2017, shortly after the actress called off her engagement to Rakshit Shetty. In the project, they starred as Vijay Govind and Geetha Kanuganti, who quickly became fan favorites for their chemistry, which led to a commercially successful run at the box office.</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong><br />
The following year, they were cast in another movie together, a rarity owing to the close timelines of both projects. But their on and offscreen sparks could not be ignored, and thus came <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/vijay-deverakonda-rashmika-mandannas-dear-comrade-plans-hindi-remake-siddhant-chaturvedi-pratibha-ranta-eyed-as-leads-1399576">Dear Comrade</a>, which essentially became the foundation of their dating phase. Rumors followed the couple no matter where they went and allowed them to test the waters with their fans, who were loving even the tiniest of their interactions.</p>

<p><strong>2020-2022</strong><br />
Secret dates and vacations became the norm for the couple. Their fans spotted them on multiple occasions, with the same backgrounds in photos and dinner sightings. However, the couple was tight-lipped and not ready to comment on it publicly, side-stepping all rumors and questions alike. They maintained that they were friends only, with Rashmika even saying that she was too early in her career for anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong><br />
During Animal promotions, she was asked to call up Vijay Deverakonda with co-star Ranbir Kapoor by her side. Answering her sudden call, the actor said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up re?,&rdquo; causing an uproar in the fandom for his casual tone. The actress blushed, informed him that they were on loud speaker, and the fans were convinced that the sparks were more than just that.</p>

<p><strong>2024</strong><br />
While never publicly confirming their rumors, the two hinted at being in a relationship. They did not reveal the names of their partners but continued to support each other&rsquo;s projects and drop subtle clues, becoming more open with their relationship.</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong><br />
Reports of the two having gotten engaged at the Kingdom actor&rsquo;s home in Hyderabad surfaced. It was said that an intimate ceremony was held in the presence of their families on October 3, 2025, with Rashmika being spotted with a new sparkler on her ring finger later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an appearance for The Girlfriend, amid ongoing success promotions, Vijay suddenly grabbed the hand of his lady love and dropped a sweet kiss, in his first public display of affection. The internet subsequently lost its mind and cheered for the two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple went on a Rome trip with their friends and featured in each other&rsquo;s social media updates, before which the actress jetted off to Sri Lanka for an apparent bachelorette party. This would be followed by them wrapping up their individual filming schedules, including Cocktail 2 for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rumors of a February wedding emerged with an invitation card revealing that the ceremony will be held in Udaipur with only close friends and family. It will be followed by a grand reception back home in Hyderabad for their colleagues and industry friends on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p>The couple finally announced their wedding to their fans amid heightened security around the venue, and is all set to tie the knot this Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

The drop from the second Friday is 35 per cent, which is good, but doesn&rsquo;t really count when the base is low enough to be called poor.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Shahid Kapoor and Triptii Dimri film has collected Rs. 8.75 crore nett approx in the first four days of its second week. The full second week will likely collect around Rs. 12 crore nett. There will be competition from The Kerala Story 2 next week, but then the following two weeks are open weeks, so it will likely continue to play in the cinemas till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/pinkvilla-predicts-first-day-box-office-forecast-for-toxic-hindi-trailer-update-for-the-kerala-story-2-final-update-for-assi-and-do-deewane-seher-mein-1400833">Toxic (Hindi)</a> arrive on March 19th. That could lead it to a Rs. 60 crore nett final.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Not that it changes anything for the film, just that, at one point, even reaching Rs. 50 crore nett felt like an improbable task, but aided by BOGO offers and this open run, it has gotten there and some more. The BOGO offers could push the NETT numbers a bit, but they take a toll on SHARE as you are paying for that extra free ticket, which goes out of SHARE. So it&#39;s not really an economic plus but more of a perception plus, but hey&hellip;picking from two poisons, it&#39;s better than outright feeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The results are consistent with director Vishal Bhardwaj, who hasn&rsquo;t found much success at the box office in his career. His collaborations with Shahid Kapoor have done relatively better, namely Kaminey and Haider. Rangoon didn&rsquo;t do well, and now this one has also faltered.</p>

That marks a 35 per cent drop from its opening day, which is generally considered good but not at this level of collection, where you need to be on par with first day and even then it might not be enough. The four day running total stands at Rs. 4.75 crore nett approx.</p>

<p>The movie needs to keep maintaining the same momentum ahead and grow with mouth publicity since the word-of-mouth seems positive.

However, that won&#39;t be easy as the movie still has low awareness among the audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The previous collaboration of Sinha and Taapsee was Thappad, which collected around Rs. 13 crore in its opening weekend and then went on to collect around Rs. 30 crore nett. This would be a good total for a film like this in today&#39;s times as theatrical business has gone down severely ever since OTT bloomed in India.

Nelson&rsquo;s script has come out very well. We&rsquo;re going to work hard to deliver a big hit next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The musician added, &ldquo;We have done a lot of mass music for Kamal Haasan sir and Rajinikanth sir in Vikram and Jailer. For KHxRK, we tried a retro music style, bringing back the 1970s.

Following the phenomenal success of Mankatha this year, another Ajith Kumar&#39;s film, Thunivu returned to the cinemas, along with Thalapathy Vijay and Trisha Krishnan starrer Ghilli. The box office rivalry between the two superstars of Tamil cinema&nbsp;hasn&#39;t been any secret. Here&#39;s a look at how both Thunivu and Ghilli performed in their opening weekends.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/ghilli-re-release-box-office-collections-thalapathy-vijay-starrer-records-strong-start-grosses-rs-1-30-crore-in-two-days-1400964">Ghilli </a>debuted with Rs. 55 lakh at the box office and went on to collect a superb Rs. 1.95 crore in its opening weekend, of which around Rs. 1.70 crore came from Tamil Nadu alone, while the remaining&nbsp;Rs. 25 lakh came from the rest of India. In contrast, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/thunivu-box-office-collections-ajith-kumar-starrer-tops-rs-100-crores-in-india-1206605">Thunivu </a>opened with Rs. 18 lakh and went on to wrap its first weekend at Rs. 42 lakh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, the Thalapathy Vijay starrer film established a big lead of Rs. 1.53 crore gross over the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/after-viswasam-ajith-kumar-and-director-siva-to-reunite-for-5th-time-filmmaker-confirms-project-1400955">Ajith Kumar</a> film. However, one must note that Ghilli had an edge over showcasing. While Ghilli was&nbsp;released in around 250 screens in Tamil Nadu other than the rest of Indian markets, Thunivu&#39;s release was exclusive for its home state alone, where it had around 225 screens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how far both these movies can go from here on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking about how being in a public relationship with a big star and a subsequent split, the Eega actor did not know whether she could ever do it again. Sharing her admiration for her current husband, the actress said, &quot;When I went through a separation, I closed up completely. I didn&rsquo;t think it would ever be possible to rely on someone else. Thankfully, I was vulnerable enough to accept that kind of love and friendship. And I&rsquo;m a much better person because of the relationship I&rsquo;m in. Because of the person Raj (Nidimoru) is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 38-year-old has had a massive change in her personality following the divorce, and so has been noted by her own pals. She shared an anecdote about having met an old friend recently, who shared a voice note with the actress later, saying, &lsquo;This is the first time in a long time that I feel like you&rsquo;re not struggling to breathe.&rsquo; The star agreed, sharing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not performing anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Neethaane En Ponvasantham star dated the son of acting superstar Nagarjuna Akkineni, Naga Chaitanya, from 2010 to 2017. The two got married in Goa on October 6, 2017. However, the duo announced their split on October 2, 2021, after months of speculation. He then got married to actress Sobhita Dhulipala in 2024.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/samantha-ruth-prabhu-says-being-real-made-split-from-naga-chaitanya-public-lot-of-trolling-and-judgment-1397833">Samantha Ruth Prabhu</a>&nbsp;was later linked to the director Raj Nidimoru, with whom she worked on The Family Man Season 2, and is one-half of the filmmaker duo Raj &amp; DK. The two got married on December 1, 2025, via a Linga Bhairava Vivaha ceremony at the Isha Foundation in Coimbatore.</p>

Allied to its Rs. 4.25 crore cume of Week 1, the total earnings of the survival thriller has reached Rs. 5.25 crore in 10 days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Backed by Colour Yellow Productions and Bhanushali Studios, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/tu-yaa-main-box-office-collections-adarsh-gourav-and-shanaya-kapoor-starrer-continues-to-struggle-cume-nears-rs-5-crore-mark-1400962">Tu Yaa Main</a> didn&#39;t record the kind of growth it needed so far. The crocodile film is&nbsp;expected to crawl from today onwards on weekdays, with significant drops. Based on the current trends, the movie won&#39;t be able to survive much longer at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for now, it is looking to wind its entire theatrical run under the Rs. 10 crore nett mark at the domestic box office. Though the movie received a slightly better reception than its rival release, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-triptii-dimri-film-has-a-poor-second-weekend-nears-rs-50-cr-in-10-days-1400972">O&#39;Romeo</a>, it still failed to show any sort of growth in the ticket sales. Sadly, audience now considers such movies as OTT films, which is why they don&#39;t bother to go to cinemas and watch such films.&nbsp;The makers need to elongate the 8-week OTT window to somewhere around 6 months to save the dying business of such small/mid-budgeted films.&nbsp;</p>

The running cume of Mardaani 3 now stands at Rs. 46.70 crore nett at the Indian box office. It emerged as the biggest net grosser of the franchise, surpassing Mardaani 2&#39;s lifetime cume of Rs. 46.30 crore on its 4th Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-rani-mukerji-recalls-national-award-win-alongside-shah-rukh-khan-hum-dono-bachchon-ke-tarah-the-1400313">Rani Mukerji</a> starrer is now running in its final legs at the box office. Based on the current trends, the movie will end its entire run around Rs. 50 crore nett mark. It will be a good total for a female-led film&nbsp;in the post-pandemic times. Mardaani also emerged as the only successful female led franchise from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerjis-cop-drama-collects-rs-5-45-crore-in-3rd-week-cume-crosses-rs-45-crore-mark-1400891">Mardaani 3</a>&nbsp;has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>

You called us &lsquo;VIROSH.&rsquo; So today, with full hearts, we name our coming together in your honor. We would like to call it &lsquo;The Wedding of VIROSH.&rsquo; Thank you for holding us with so much love. You are a part of us, always. Biggest hugs and all our love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those unaware, Vijay and Rashmika first appeared together on the big screen in the film Geetha Govindam. Following the Parasuram directorial, the duo also appeared together in Dear Comrade, during which relationship rumors about them were rampant. Now, the couple is all set to tie the knot in an intimate ceremony on February 26, with a reception expected to take place in Hyderabad on March 4, 2026.</p>

<p>Though its a good total, the movie remained far behind Deol&#39;s last blockbuster, Gadar 2. Nevertheless, Border 2 emerged as a Clean Hit venture. At one point, even Super Hit or Blockbuster verdict seemed a possibility but the movie couldn&#39;t maintain the same momentum on weekdays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, Border 2 emerged as the first Hit film of 2026 from Hindi cinema.&nbsp;The movie&nbsp;has done better in northern circuits, where Rajasthan is closer to BLOCKBUSTER, while Delhi-UP and East Punjab have done SUPER HIT business.

Hosted by Alan Cumming, the 79th British Academy Film Awards was a star-studded affair with the biggest stars in attendance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the winners of the night, Paul Thomas Anderson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/one-battle-after-another-exclusive-leonardo-dicaprio-on-his-dream-collaboration-with-benicio-del-toro-and-their-camaraderie-1396785">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>-led&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-presents-value-for-money-hilarity-with-punch-in-the-gut-emotion-1397201">One Battle After Another</a> was the biggest earner with an impressive 6 grabs. Michael B. Jordan&rsquo;s Sinners followed with 3 of its own. Robert Aramayo, who led I Swear,&nbsp;was the most welcome surprise, winning the coveted Best Leading Actor award among some of the best contenders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the biggest shock remained Marty Supreme, which was given no trophies even after being in the running for a whopping 11. The Josh Safdie sports dramedy tied 1969 film Women in Love and 2004&rsquo;s Finding Neverland in doing so. The latter two went on to nab one Oscar each, meaning all hope is not lost for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/timothee-chalamet-goes-instagram-official-with-kylie-jenner-after-dating-for-3-years-tremendously-grateful-1399867">Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet</a> starrer, which did get big wins at Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes.</p>

<p>The BAFTA was an awaited event of 2026. At the 79th edition of the&nbsp;British Academy Film Awards, the Indian contingent shined bright. While Alia Bhatt presented an award, the Indian film Boong won an award. In the In Memoriam segment, the academy remembered the late legend, Bollywood actor Dharmendra, alongside many big names from the entertainment industry across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>BAFTA 2026 pays tribute to Dharmendra</strong></p>

<p>Indian actor and Bollywood icon, 89-year-old <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/dharmendra-passes-away-amitabh-bachchan-abhishek-arrive-at-legendary-actors-residence-1398681">Dharmendra</a>, left for his heavenly abode in November 2025, leaving a huge void. With his extensive filmography spanning decades, the actor entertained the audience, welcoming love from fans from across the globe. Hence, the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) recognised his contribution to the world of cinema and paid an emotional tribute to the star and his unmatched legacy.</p>

<p>During the show, Jessie Ware took over the mic and sang Barbra Streisand&rsquo;s The Way We Were. As she made the audience emotional with her soulful voice, the award remembered the legends of global cinema with a touching video. In the clip, Dharmendra&rsquo;s image was put next to French actress Brigitte Bardot and German actor Udo Kier.</p>

<p>Through the video, BAFTA also paid tribute to icons like Diane Keaton, Terence Stamp, Catherine O&#39;Hara, Rob Reiner, Robert Duvall, Gene Hackman, Pauline Collins Obe, Tom Stoppard, Graham Greene, Diane Ladd, Val Kilmer, Lalo Schifrin, Michael Madsen, and others. Casting directors, production designers, composers, musicians, make-up artists, editors, directors, screenwriters, set decorators, and other artists were also remembered by the academy.</p>

<p><strong>India at the BAFTA Awards</strong></p>

<p>At the 79<sup>th</sup> BAFTA Awards held at London&rsquo;s Royal Festival Hall on Sunday, February 22, 2026, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bafta-awards-2026-alia-bhatt-stuns-by-delivering-her-presenter-speech-in-hindi-video-1400973">Alia Bhatt</a> made her debut as a presenter. She impressed the Indian audience by starting her speech in Hindi. The National Award-winning actress presented the award for Film Not In The English Language.</p>

<p>At the prestigious global platform, director Laxmipriya Devi&rsquo;s Manipuri-language film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/bafta-2026-farhan-aktar-backed-manipuri-film-boong-wins-best-childrens-and-family-film-award-1400974">Boong</a> won the Best Children&rsquo;s and Family Film Award. The movie is backed by Farhan Akhtar&rsquo;s production house.</p>

The domestic and overseas split for the film stands at Rs. 2.40 crore (Rs. 2 crore nett) and Rs. 6.10 crore (USD 675K) respectively. Compared to the other recent Ammy Virk films, the opening weekend is below Saunkan Saunkanay 2 (Rs. 15 crore) and Sarbala (Rs. 11.25 crore).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The overseas performance ranges from so-so to good. The good being Canada, which was on par with Sarbala and better than Saunkan Saunkanay 2. Had Canada not delivered, it would have been a total lost cause, but now Canada has given it some numbers to go with.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The main disappointment came in India, where the film has not done well. The original Bambukat was a blockbuster in 2016, which opened to bumper numbers and then trended superbly. Considering how comedy sequels do well, one would have expected triple the numbers it has done. The trend over the weekend is also quite mediocre, with Sunday not growing as much as it could have.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Box Office Collections of Bambukat 2 in India is as follows:</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjabi film box office in India has fallen off from the highs of the 2010s, when the business was growing and sort of peaked towards the end of the decade. The quality of films aside, one of the major driving factors is demographic change. A sustained wave of emigration in the late 2010s and early 2020s has reshaped the core audience base. A large chunk of the business has shifted from India to overseas markets like Canada and Australia. It is now common for overseas collections to be multiple times higher than those in India. In contrast, pre-COVID, the business used to be more domestic-heavy, with rarely any film collecting more overseas than in India.</p>

It will not be a major surgery, but instead a small procedure to &lsquo;burn&rsquo; it. He added, &ldquo;The doctor had told us that poorly differentiated and very aggressive tumors have chances of recurrence. Even though it&rsquo;s in early stages now, this didn&rsquo;t appear in the PT scan we did in December. We have even got blood reports done, and the range is slightly higher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actress will be hospitalized for 3-4 days with the surgery planned for Tuesday, February 23. The couple is relieved that the cyst was discovered quickly and will be taken care of soon.</p>

The couple that has been going out for a while now, made sure the world knew they were together in an undeniable PDA moment at the award ceremony. With a cheek kiss, the That&#39;s So True singer sealed it in for her boyfriend, who she came in to support for how work with Hamnet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re taking a look at the couple&rsquo;s journey from strangers to lovers.</p>

<p><strong>June 2024: First spotting</strong><br />
Just weeks after fans began connecting the dots about the two being in cahoots, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/isnt-that-devastating-gladiator-ii-star-paul-mescal-reveals-how-untrue-rumors-of-one-night-stands-affected-his-mom-1353648">Paul Mescal</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/happy-birthday-gracie-abrams-top-10-songs-to-listen-to-as-singer-turns-25-1345849">Gracie Abrams</a> were spotted by TMZ, with him reaching out to cup her face at a food outing. Prior to this, many even speculated that she had given a nod to the actor&rsquo;s Normal People role in her song Normal Thing, writing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal thing to fall in love with movie stars. When the lights are low, and red at all their favorite bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They continued to be spotted together, including a Mayfair shopping outing and other small dates around. They&rsquo;re called to be like &lsquo;any other young couple&rsquo; by a source speaking to The Sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>August 2024: London kisses</strong><br />
The two were once again photographed by paparazzi but this time in a manner that almost confirmed their romance. Daily Mail shared snaps of them holding hands while in London, with an onlooker claiming they were &lsquo;kissing a lot.&rsquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been hooking up and it&rsquo;s still early stages,&rdquo; a source then said to PEOPLE.</p>

<p><strong>September 2024: Public dating</strong><br />
The two finally decided to go public with a stroll hand-in-hand. A laid-back date, their outing was a clear declaration of the new romance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>October 2024: Eras Tour&nbsp;</strong><br />
Paul Mescal was there to support his girlfriend, Gracie Abrams, as she opened for Taylor Swift at the Eras Tour in Miami, where he interacted with fellow concertgoers from a VIP section of the crowd. Many casual dates across the country followed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>November 2024: Party people</strong><br />
The duo attended the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-when-paul-mescal-claimed-hed-be-in-a-bad-spot-if-gladiator-2-makes-him-a-household-name-more-people-will-stop-you-1362267">Gladiator II</a> premiere after-party together and made their first work-related appearance beside each other. Their coordinated knit outfits only added to the charm. He then supported her once again at the Saturday Night Live after party the following month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>February 2025: High bars</strong><br />
Gracie Abrams spoke about having a high bar in her relationships while speaking to Cosmopolitan. She did not mention her beau by name but hinted at how their dating phase was going with, &ldquo;My current form of love feels like home no matter where I am,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s literally nothing better than being with somebody where you&rsquo;re not putting on a performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>May 2025: Reverse support</strong><br />
The History of Sound premiere at the Cannes Film Festival saw the American star make an appearance for her man, still not making it a couple&rsquo;s outing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>June 2025: Festival date and going Instagram official&nbsp;</strong><br />
The duo was spotted enjoying Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s set, and she made it semi-Instagram official with a clip of her sitting on his shoulders as the singer belted The Cure&rsquo;s Friday I&rsquo;m In Love. Soon after, they were official on social media as she shared photos from their day out with friends at the music festival and captioned it with all hearts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>January 2026: Surprise confessions</strong><br />
During Hamnet promotions, Gracie Abrams shared a photo of her partner, who plays William Shakespeare in the film, and wrote, &ldquo;Also I love him surprise.&rdquo; She praised his co-stars in an emotional update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid more support for each other&rsquo;s projects and mushy birthday messages, their latest red carpet official moment is all everyone can talk about!</p>

This brings the total cume of Assi to Rs. 4.10 crore nett at the Indian box office in its opening weekend. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The movie needs to show strong trends ahead on weekdays and then on the second weekend in order to have a chance at the box office. So far the word-of-mouth is positive, however, the movie isn't getting the kind of audience support it need. That may be due to lack of awareness among the audience around its release and then the lowkey marketing strategy. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/assi-twitter-review-11-tweets-to-read-before-watching-taapsee-pannu-in-anubhav-sinhas-courtroom-drama-1400924" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Assi Box Office Collections: Taapsee Pannu starrer records 60 percent spike on Day 2, nets Rs 2.60 crore in two days ','1400963','https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/assi-twitter-review-11-tweets-to-read-before-watching-taapsee-pannu-in-anubhav-sinhas-courtroom-drama-1400924','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-records-60-percent-spike-on-day-2-nets-rs-2-60-crore-in-two-days-1400963','Taapsee Pannu','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Taapsee Pannu</a>, Kani Kusruti, Revathy, Manoj Pahwa, Kumud Mishra, and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, the courtroom drama has a clean run until the release of Dhurandhar and Toxic (March 19), which means, it might have a chance if it manages to grow well further and stick to the cinemas for a long run. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The previous collaboration between Anubhav Sinha and Taapsee Pannu was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-revisiting-taapsee-pannus-thappad-at-the-box-office-on-5-years-release-anniversary-1375096">Thappad</a>, which debuted with Rs. 2.75 crore and went on to collect Rs. 13.50 crore nett in its opening weekend. Thappad eventually recovered its cost of production and ended its theatrical run around Rs. 30 crore nett, which would be considered as a good outcome for a film like this in today's scenario. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Compared to Thappad, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/assi-box-office-collections-taapsee-pannu-starrer-records-60-percent-spike-on-day-2-nets-rs-2-60-crore-in-two-days-1400963">Assi </a>is nowhere closer. That's due to Post-COVID, with the OTT boom, the theatrical base has eroded, and non-event films have seen their business contract sharply. </p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

Devi began her speech by greeting the audience in her native language. She further expressed that the walk up to the stage to receive the global award felt like the final few steps to the summit of a mountain that the team never knew they were climbing.</p>

<p>She thanked the jury members of BAFTA for giving their &ldquo;small film such big love.&rdquo; Talking about her creation, she said that the movie is not only rooted in a place that is troubled, ignored, and underrepresented in India. Paying homage to her homeland, Manipur, she prayed for peace to return to the Indian state.</p>

<p><strong>About Boong</strong></p>

<p>Boong is a 2024 movie penned and helmed by Devi. It tells the story of a schoolboy named Boong who braves through conflicts and racial tensions in Manipur to reunite his family. The movie stars actors like Gugun Kipgen, Bala Hijam, Angom Sanamatum, Vikram Kochhar, Nemetia Ngangbam, Jenny Khurai, and Hamom Sadananda.</p>

<p>Before its BAFTA win, the film had its world premiere at the Discovery section of the Toronto International Film Festival on September 5, 2024. The movie was released in select cinemas on September 19, 2025.</p>

<p>To make her presence felt at BAFTA 2026, Alia Bhatt arrived at the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, London, donning a stunning custom silver dress by Gucci with a white furry stole. Her sequined backless gown had a halter-neck that perfectly accentuated her toned body. With a pair of tangling diamond earrings, a cocktail ring, and a no-makeup glam, she completed her look.</p>

<p>At the event, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/11-best-alia-bhatt-movies-to-watch-on-ott-gangubai-kathiawadi-highway-rocky-aur-rani-kii-prem-kahaani-and-more-1397503">Darlings</a> actress presented the award for Film Not In The English Language. As host Alan Cumming introduced her at the event, he called Bhatt a &ldquo;hugely talented actress and entrepreneur.&rdquo; Alan continued, &ldquo;This means she has conquered both show business and business-business. But can she conquer the business of presenting at a BAFTA? I am sure she can. Please welcome one of India&rsquo;s most moved and critically acclaimed actors &ndash; Alia Bhatt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the Student of the Year debutant presented the country at the global platform, a Manipuri-language Indian film titled Boong, bankrolled by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/from-7-vanity-vans-to-no-bound-scripts-is-this-why-ranveer-singh-and-farhan-akhtar-had-a-fallout-over-don-3-1400610">Farhan Akhtar</a>&rsquo;s Excel Entertainment, won the award for Best Children&#39;s and Family Film at&nbsp;BAFTA&nbsp;2026.</p>

The drop from its <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-drops-on-wednesday-nears-rs-40-cr-in-six-days-1400877">opening weekend</a> was 73 per cent, which itself was quite ordinary. The total box office collections after ten days in release are short of Rs. 50 crore nett, which it is expected to cross today.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shahid Kapoor and Triptii Dimri starrer had a so-so opening day, which it followed with a rather meh trend. There were two surprisingly</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">days on Monday and Tuesday, thanks to the BOGO offer and some feeding, but then it dropped on Wednesday and since then has only gone further down. Even the second weekend saw a mediocre growth on Saturday, and Sunday saw collections falling, thanks in large part to the cricket match in the evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first weekend, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. There won&rsquo;t be much going on at the box office till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic releases, it will possibly crawl its way towards Rs. 60 crore nett.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Box Office Collections of O Romeo in India are as follows:</h3>

Originally slated for a grand theatrical debut on January 9, 2026, the project has reportedly been stalled due to pending certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The delay has disappointed fans who were eagerly looking forward to seeing the superstar on the big screen in what is being described as his last film before a full-fledged career plunge.</p>

<p><strong>CBFC yet to begin review</strong></p>

<p>According to multiple reports, the holdup stems from the revising committee of the CBFC not commencing the review process. Last week it was reported, the newly appointed panel has neither initiated re-censoring proceedings nor communicated any official update to the production house of the film, KVN Productions. Without the required certification or acknowledgment, the makers are unable to finalize a release plan. Apparently, the lack of clarity has added to the further speculation in the industry, leaving the film&rsquo;s fate hanging in the balance.</p>

<p><strong>June 2026 Release to be considered</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new update shared by Valai Pechu suggests that the team is exploring an alternative release window. If pending formalities are completed in time, the H. Vinoth directorial could potentially arrive in theaters in June 2026. The tentative date being considered is Thursday, June 18, strategically kept before Vijay&rsquo;s 52nd birthday and coinciding with the Muharram long weekend.</p>

<p><strong>No official confirmation given</strong></p>

<p>Despite the growing buzz around a June release, the makers of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-thalapathy-vijay-confessed-having-one-sided-crushes-i-used-to-get-attracted-to-1380634">Vijay</a> starrer have not issued any formal statement. According to reports, it is indicated that internal discussions are ongoing, with June emerging as the most viable option should certification hurdles be resolved. Until then, Jana Nayagan release date remains unconfirmed, with fans awaiting definitive news on when Vijay&rsquo;s final cinematic outing will finally see the light of day.</p>

Originally released in 2004, the sports action drama returned to the cinemas this weekend and it opened to a superb reception. Debuted with Rs. 60 lakh, the movie recorded a jump on Day 2 and collected Rs. 70 lakh, bringing the two-day cume to Rs. 1.30 crore gross at the Tamil Nadu box office. </p>

<p>Based on the current trends, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/ghilli-box-office-collections-thalapathy-vijay-starrer-obilterate-opening-record-for-indian-re-releases-1297720">Ghilli </a>is looking to record its first weekend of Rs. 2 crore or so, which is a solid result for a film, which had a mega re-release just 2 years ago and holds the record for biggest re-release for the Tamil film industry by a huge margin. For the record, Ghilli collected over Rs. 20 crore in its home state during its previous re-release, which is still a dream to achieve for other re-releases. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how the Thalapathy Vijay and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/7-trisha-krishnan-movies-on-ott-that-prove-shes-a-powerhouse-performer-1377856">Trisha Krishnan</a> starrer performs in this inning. Even if the movie collects 1/3rd of what the movie did two years back will consider as a success. </p>

There is a growth of 60 per cent from the opening day, which would normally be good but when the level of business is so low, you need to double or treble to succeed at the box office. This jump doesn&#39;t cut it at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The survival thriller starring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/tu-yaa-main-box-office-collections-day-6-adarsh-gourav-and-shanaya-kapoor-starrer-continues-its-disappointing-run-nets-rs-35-lakh-on-wednesday-1400870">Adarsh Gourav</a> and Shanaya Kapoor is looking to wind its second weekend at Rs. 90 lakh to 1 crore, and its second week around Rs. 1.50 crore in India. Based on the current trends, it won&#39;t be able to go much beyond from there on. The movie is heading for a finish around Rs. 7 crore nett or so.&nbsp;</p>

The makers need to elongate the 8-week OTT window to somewhere around 6 months to save the dying business of such small/mid-budgeted films.&nbsp;</p>

That said, Day 2 remained largely flat with a miniscule 20 per cent growth overall, which leaves the movie with no chance at the box office but to only see a disappointing theatrical run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Based on the trends, the romantic drama is looking to wind its opening weekend around Rs. 4 to 5 crore nett.&nbsp;</p>

Still it didn&#39;t see the kind of growth it needed over the weekend. It needs to work on the mouth publicity and show strong legs on weekdays and then hold for a long run, in order to survive and reach a respectable figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Do Deewane Seher Mein is a perfect love story of an imperfect couple. While one has issues with his pronunciation, the other one is here to change the world. Despite having a turbulent start, they finally fall for each other. Besides the leading pair, the movie also stars Ila Arun, Joy Sengupta, Ayesha Raza, Sandeepa Dhar, Naveen Kaushik, and more.</p>

There was a 40&nbsp;per cent growth in business, which is good, but the business remains at low levels. There should be a big growth today, as Punjabi films do strongly on Sundays, and since the business is at a low level, the growth in percentage could turn out to be particularly big.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overseas, the film is faring comparatively better, especially in Canada. There, it is outperforming Saunkan Saunkanay 2, the highest-grossing Punjabi film domestically over the past two years. The two-day overseas box office gross stands at USD 475K (Rs. 4.35&nbsp;crore) approx, giving the film a worldwide box office gross of Rs. 5.75 crore approx. Led by Ammy Virk and Binnu Dhillon, the film is now eyeing a weekend total in the range of Rs. 9-9.50 crore approx.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjabi film box office in India has fallen off from the highs of the 2010s, when the business was growing and sort of peaked towards the end of the decade. The quality of films aside, one of the major driving factors is demographic change. A sustained wave of emigration in the late 2010s and early 2020s has reshaped the core audience base. A large chunk of the business has shifted from India to overseas markets like Canada and Australia. It is now common for overseas collections to be multiple times higher than those in India. In contrast, pre-COVID, the business used to be more domestic-heavy, with rarely any film collecting more overseas than in India.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the industry is facing a double whammy by missing out on some potential big grossers that have not secured a release in India due to external factors, such as featuring Pakistani artists (Sardaar Ji 3 and Chal Mera Putt 4) or facing censor issues (Punjab 95). Audiences are also not as keen on giving original films a chance as they were in the previous decade, with comedy sequels being the only ones getting traction from time to time. However, lately, even some of these comedy sequels are failing, with Bambukat 2 seemingly the latest addition to that list.</p>

The film registered around 50 per cent growth from Friday, which is on the lower side compared to the kind of jumps films tend to witness on their second Saturdays these days, with many even doubling their Friday numbers. However, with the business having remained at an elevated level through the week due to BOGO offers since Monday, a relatively muted surge over the weekend was always on the cards.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The film isn&rsquo;t expected to show much growth on Sunday for the kind of film it is, but since the business is at a low level, the growth might come. There is a cricket match today, which may also limit the growth. Accordingly, the Shahid Kapoor and Triptii Dimri starrer will rake in Rs. 7.50-8 crore nett over its second weekend, for a total of over/under Rs. 50 crore nett at EOD today. There won&rsquo;t be much going on at the box office till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic releases, it will possibly crawl its way towards Rs. 60 crore nett.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first weekend, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and Tuesday briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that, but the drop on Wednesday took that possibility away, and since then, it has only gone down.</p>

Dhawan was seen in a traditional sherwani featuring a monochromatic white-on-white palette with delicate tonal embroidery that added texture without overwhelming the look, evoking a royal aesthetic. His ensemble also included a layered emerald mala with deep forest-green stones that provided a striking contrast against the ivory fabric, along with a classic white turban.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sophie wore a contemporary lehenga choli that blended traditional silhouettes with a romantic, ethereal color palette. The lehenga was embellished with soft coral, peach, and sage green floral motifs, creating a &ldquo;blooming garden&rdquo; effect against the ivory silk base.</p>

<p>The choli featured a high neckline and long sleeves adorned with cascading pearl strands, giving the appearance of built-in jewelry and adding a touch of vintage glamour. Sophie&rsquo;s styling beautifully fused cultures: her hands were adorned with intricate mehendi, and she wore a delicate maang tikka. Meanwhile, her voluminous blonde waves and soft, dewy makeup lent a modern, red-carpet finish to the ensemble.</p>

<p>This marriage marks Shikhar&rsquo;s second, following his official separation from his ex-wife, Aesha Mukerji, in October 2023. The former couple were married for 11 years and have one son.</p>

<p><strong>Jithu Madhavan confirms Suriya 47 to be a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Tamil movie</strong></p>

<p>During a recent media interaction at an airport, Jithu Madhavan was asked whether <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/suriya-47-jithu-madhavans-next-with-suriya-begins-with-pooja-ceremony-nazriya-and-naslen-join-the-ensemble-1399028">Suriya 47</a> would resemble a Malayalam film. In response, the filmmaker said, &ldquo;The shoot for Suriya 47 is ongoing, and updates will be made officially. It will be a proper Tamil film.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Naslen expected to play an important role in the movie, the director was also asked for an update on Fahadh Faasil&rsquo;s Aavesham 2. However, he clarified that nothing has been confirmed yet and that discussions are still underway.</p>

<p>With Nazriya Nazim playing the co-lead, the film will also feature Naslen in a pivotal role. Sushin Shyam will make his debut in Tamil cinema as the film&rsquo;s composer.</p>

<p><strong>Suriya&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Suriya is next set to appear in the lead role in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/suriya-46-to-hit-big-screens-in-july-or-august-2026-producer-confirms-post-karuppu-release-plans-1400755">Karuppu</a>, directed by RJ Balaji. The fantasy action film stars Trisha Krishnan as the co-lead and is said to revolve around a lawyer who becomes possessed by a deity and fights against injustice.</p>

<p>Apart from the leads, the movie is expected to feature Indrans, Natty Subramaniam, Swasika, Sshivada, and Anagha Maya Ravi in key roles. While an official release date has not yet been announced, the film is expected to hit theaters in April 2026.</p>

<p><strong>SRK gets an update on Salim Khan&rsquo;s health with a hospital visit</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday evening, Shah Rukh Khan made his way to Lilavati Hospital to check on Salim Khan. He was spotted arriving in his car shortly after Salman Khan was recorded visiting the hospital. After being inside for close to an hour, King Khan was noted to have exited the premises of the facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Subsequently, Malaika Arora, the ex-wife of Salim Khan&rsquo;s son, Arbaaz Khan, was also sighted visiting the hospital today. Zeeshan Ziauddin Siddique, the son of Baba Siddique, also arrived to check on the 90-year-old&rsquo;s health, as well as Avinash Gowariker.</p>

<p>The Khan family, including the kids, their in-laws, and the grandchildren of Salim Khan, have regularly been paying a visit to be by his side as he recovers. After being admitted early morning on Tuesday, the veteran writer was known to have had a brain haemorrhage. As shared by the concerned health professional, after keeping him on ventilator support as a precautionary measure and not because he was critical, a procedure called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khans-father-salim-khan-undergoes-angiography-doctor-hopeful-about-taking-him-off-ventilator-on-february-19-1400848">Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) was performed</a> the following day.&nbsp;</p>

Now, director Siva has also confirmed that he will reunite with the superstar once again.</p>

<p><strong>Ajith Kumar and Siva to reunite for their 5th movie</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to Cinema Vikatan, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-director-siva-gives-clarification-on-trailer-2-of-suriyas-kanguva-shares-the-locked-run-time-of-the-mystical-1354779">Siva</a> confirmed that he will collaborate with Ajith Kumar on an upcoming film. While the project is on the cards, the director stated that official updates will be shared through proper channels at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>He also reportedly mentioned that Ajith is currently gearing up for his next project with Adhik Ravichandran, tentatively titled AK64. Updates about the film with Siva are expected only after AK64 goes on floors.</p>

<p>As of now, no further details about the project with Siva have been revealed, and it remains unclear whether it will be Ajith&rsquo;s 65th film. If confirmed, this would mark the duo&rsquo;s fifth collaboration after Veeram, Vedalam, Vivegam, and Viswasam.</p>

<p><strong>Ajith Kumar&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

The film follows AK, a former crime boss popularly known as Red Dragon.</p>

Now, the film&rsquo;s sequel, Kalki 2898 AD: Part 2, is in the works and is reportedly said to have gone on floors, with Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan filming their portions first.</p>

<p><strong>Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan to begin shooting for Kalki 2898 AD: Part 2?</strong></p>

<p>According to online reports, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prabhas-to-begin-shooting-for-kalki-2898-ad-part-2-from-february-2-heres-what-we-know-1400264">Kalki 2898 AD: Part 2</a> has begun shooting this year. The makers are reportedly filming scenes featuring Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan on a set in Shankarpally.</p>

<p>The current schedule is said to include key scenes that do not involve Prabhas. However, these remain unconfirmed reports, as no official announcement has been made yet.</p>

<p><strong>More about Kalki 2898 AD</strong></p>

<p>Kalki 2898 AD begins at the end of the Mahabharata&rsquo;s Kurukshetra War, marking the onset of the Kali Yuga in 3102 BC. After the war, Ashwatthama is entrusted by Lord Krishna with the responsibility of protecting Lord Vishnu&rsquo;s final avatar when the time comes.</p>

<p>Six thousand years later, in 2898 AD, the world has transformed into a harsh dystopia ruled through fear by a self-proclaimed god known as Supreme Yaskin. While most people strive to appease him in hopes of gaining access to his abundant land, known as the Complex, others rise in rebellion against his tyranny.</p>

<p>As hope begins to fade, a new light emerges in the form of an unborn child carried by SUM-80, also known as Sumathi. With Yaskin and his followers determined to extract the child&rsquo;s life force, an epic tale unfolds, setting the stage for the rest of the saga.</p>

<p>The first installment starred Prabhas in the lead role and also featured <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/exclusive-priyadarshan-says-he-wanted-to-make-hungama-with-amitabh-bachchan-and-not-paresh-rawal-says-making-last-attempt-1397072">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, Deepika Padukone, and Kamal Haasan in prominent roles. As Deepika has reportedly opted out of the project, rumors suggest that Sai Pallavi may replace her in the sequel.</p>

Although the makers earlier announced that Vijay Sethupathi would be playing a pivotal role in the movie, rumors recently suggested that he had exited the project.</p>

<p>However, the 96 actor has now cleared the air, confirming that he is still a part of the film.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Sethupathi confirms being still part of STR&rsquo;s Arasan</strong></p>

<p>Speaking at a fan meet event organized by Behindwoods, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-sethupathi-confesses-to-being-unaware-about-his-character-in-simbus-arasan-i-dont-know-anything-about-my-role-1399220">Vijay Sethupathi</a> was asked whether he was still involved in Arasan or had stepped away from the project, as rumors were circulating.</p>

<p>Responding to the query, the actor said, &ldquo;Nope. There is nothing like that. Rumors always spread quickly. Even I don&rsquo;t know how. Every time, some rumor or another surfaces, and we don&rsquo;t know who initiated it. Please don&rsquo;t believe them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to ongoing reports, the STR starrer is yet to begin its second shooting&nbsp;schedule.</p>

<p><strong>More about Arasan</strong></p>

While the earnings for both films have been highly anticipated, it seems that their inevitable tussle at the cinemas might affect them, or so Sanjay Gupta believes. Speaking to Variety India, the director spoke about how the two films will just end up eating each other&rsquo;s business in the unfortunate meeting at the box office.</p>

<p><strong>Sanjay Gupta shares disappointment over Dhurandhar 2 and Toxic&rsquo;s clash</strong></p>

<p>Giving the example of his film Kaabil, which clashed with Raees, he believes both would have been better off without the clash and has attributed it to the financial status of the country. He said, &ldquo;Our people don&rsquo;t have money flowing that they can just go and watch two films back-to-back. There are many people who can&rsquo;t watch two films in one month. It&rsquo;s unnecessary, but again, the makers probably have their reasons.&quot; And while he himself would be turning up for both projects, that seems less likely for the masses, according to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He predicted that both films would be able to perform; however, achieving their maximum potential is where he sees the problem,&nbsp;&ldquo;Both films will do well, but neither will accomplish their individual capacity. So, it&rsquo;s unfortunate.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He lavished praise on the Aditya Dhar directorial and hinted at the future of Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s character. He shared, &ldquo;I have a vague idea of where the story is going to go and all of that. We&rsquo;re going to have Hamza&rsquo;s backstory, why he became who he is, and all of that. See, Dhurandhar is a phenomenon.&rdquo; Meanwhile, Toxic has gained many eyeballs due to its star cast, including Yash, Nayanthara, Kiara Advani, Tara Sutaria, and more.</p>

<p>Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Yash starrer Toxic: A Fairytale For Adults are all for a March 19 premiere.</p>

His family shared a confirmation, as reported by PEOPLE, that he had breathed his last surrounded by his family and close friends following a battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that lasted around a year after being publicly revealed in April 2025. Now, a new interview has been released by Netflix, taken before the actor&rsquo;s passing, covering some of his last words to the world. It held a special message to his two kids, Billie and Georgia.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane speaks to teenage daughters in a chat revealed posthumously</strong></p>

<p>As a part of the platform&rsquo;s interview series, Famous Last Words, Eric Dane&rsquo;s final chat in front of the camera was revealed to the world. It included a confirmation on both sides that the same would be shared only after his passing. So, one day later, it was released globally for the fans of the star. He spoke to his children while looking at the camera to the best of his ability, and said, &ldquo;Billie and Georgia, these words are for you. I tried. I stumbled sometimes, but I tried. Overall, we had a blast, didn&rsquo;t we? I remember all the times we spent at the beach, the two of you, me and mom &mdash; in Santa Monica, Hawaii, Mexico. I see you now playing in the ocean for hours, my water babies. Those days, pun intended, were heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to share four of his biggest learnings in life, with the advice to live in the present being his first. He wanted them to cherish every moment and not dwell on the past, unlike what he did. The Euphoria star also wished his kids could be in love, whether with another person or something, and that it was for them to decide. He went on to share his passion for acting and how it brought him the best and some of the worst days in his life. His third piece of advice was to find friends who are not just there for the good bits but also the bad ones, and don&rsquo;t hesitate to call you out on it, as they are the ones who can shape you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, he shared how they must not stop fighting and wanting to live no matter what. &ldquo;Fight with every ounce of your being, and with dignity. When you face challenges, health or otherwise, fight. Never give up. Fight until your last breath. This disease is slowly taking my body, but it will never take my spirit,&rdquo; he said.</p>

Actress Replaces Engagement Ring With Gold Band]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1508315441_zendaya-tom-holland-1.webp"></img><p>Tinsel Town&rsquo;s favorite couple, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/are-zendaya-and-tom-holland-expecting-their-first-child-amidst-wedding-rumors-heres-what-we-know-1400556">Tom Holland and Zendaya</a>, got engaged back in December 2024 over the holidays. With many speculations surrounding their impending marriage, the two have remained tight-lipped about it, choosing to be as private as possible. However, a recent update seems to have their fans jumping around in excitement. On February 18 local time, the Dune actress was spotted in Beverly Hills with a gold band on her ring finger, raising speculations of a secret wedding to the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-tom-holland-blend-romance-and-work-with-london-walk-and-indian-lunch-on-spider-man-set-1395388">Spider-Man</a> himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zendaya and Tom Holland may have gotten married secretly, and here&rsquo;s what we know about it</strong></p>

<p>As per a Hello! report, the 29-year-old was photographed alongside film producer Josh Lieberman in Los Angeles on Wednesday. While going for a laid-back look in a white jacket over a plain T-shirt and some loose trousers, it was her hand that grabbed the most eyeballs. It was belatedly shared that she had swapped out her 5-carat diamond ring from fianc&eacute; Tom Holland for a shiny gold band on her ring finger, leading to questions about whether the two lovers had gotten married in a secret ceremony already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-drops-her-cutesy-throwback-pic-to-celebrate-28th-birthday-pens-truly-means-the-world-to-me-1345546">Zendaya</a> and Tom Holland have not commented on the same, the same could very well be possible for the couple, who have always opted for privacy around their relationship. Previously, there were a lot of questions about the duo possibly getting married this year; however, her close friend and popular stylist, Law Roach, had shared in July 2025 that the process hadn&rsquo;t even been started back then. Six months on, and we think it&rsquo;s very much achievable that the two held a small ceremony without the knowledge of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After dating since 2021, the couple chose not to announce their engagement, but the actress stepped onto the Golden Globes 2025 red carpet with a new sparkler on her finger, confirming it. Later, a source shared that the proposal happened over the holidays in December 2024. She was seen frequenting the set of his films in recent months, as the couple spent every possible moment together between busy schedules.</p>

All three films failed to get a start, with combined collections of around Rs. 2.50 crore from three on over 9000 shows. Assi had the widest release of the three, while Do Deewane Seher Mein came up with higher&nbsp;collections.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/do-deewane-sheher-mein-advance-booking-siddhant-chaturvedi-and-mrunal-thakur-starrer-sells-10000-tickets-on-bookmyshow-1400903">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a>&nbsp;collected&nbsp;Rs. 1.15-1.25 crore nett approx on its first day. This is a low number, but it&rsquo;s not really a day one film and what matters more is how it does today on Saturday. If it manages to grow well over the weekend and then hold closer to Friday numbers on weekdays, it could have a run of sorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/assi-twitter-review-11-tweets-to-read-before-watching-taapsee-pannu-in-anubhav-sinhas-courtroom-drama-1400924">Assi</a> collected around Rs. 1 crore nett approx on Friday, substantially lower than the openings of the previous collaboration of Taapsee Pannu and Anubhav Sinha, Thappad, which opened at Rs. 2.75 crore nett in 2020. Those were comparatively better times for the box office, particularly for films in this space. Post-COVID, with the OTT boom, the theatrical base has eroded, and non-event films have seen their business contract sharply. Thappad eventually went on to collect Rs. 30 crore nett approx, a figure that was viewed as below par by the trade at the time (trade tends to be stringent with such films). If that number was achieved today, it would likely be viewed far more favourably.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Shatak: Sangh Ke 100 Varsh was a non-starter, collecting around Rs. 20&nbsp;lakh nett. The very fact that an AI film is not only given a theatrical release but also has an A-lister from the industry endorsing and promoting it is, quite frankly, appalling. The film may get some political support, which could lead to growth in business at some point, if at all.</p>

Arshad said that until Aryan&rsquo;s series came out, no one knew what he was. But now, it&rsquo;s known what he&rsquo;s all about. &ldquo;He is a star without being an actor, and not because he&rsquo;s Shah Rukh&rsquo;s son. At a young age, he has multiple businesses running,&rdquo; he opined.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/shah-rukh-khan-makes-stylish-entry-in-mumbai-with-wife-gauri-and-suhana-khan-after-celebrating-new-year-video-1399607">Suhana Khan</a>, on the other hand, he says, is a sweet kid who is working hard on her big-screen debut film, King. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not an ounce of bad behaviour in both of them. They are bound to succeed. There&rsquo;s too much goodwill going on,&rdquo; he divulged.</p>

<p>When asked about his relationship with Shah Rukh, Arshad was quick to state that the Pathaan actor is a good host and a wonderful human being. &ldquo;He&#39;s one of those guys who has given my profession dignity,&rdquo; stated Arshad, adding that Khan, along with Dilip Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, &quot;made us look so good all over the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well-behaved, talented, and well spoken. The whole industry owes it to them,&rdquo; concluded the Golmaal Again star.

Overseas was a slightly better, where it earned USD 200K (Rs. 1.85 crore) approx, giving it a worldwide first day number of nearly Rs. 2.50 crore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Starring Ammy Virk and Binoo Dhillon, Bambukat 2 is the sequel to the 2016 blockbuster, Bambukat. The original film had a bumper opening of Rs. 1.60 crore (Rs. 1.48 crore nett) in India, registering the fourth biggest opening ever for a Punjabi film at the time. In comparison, the sequel has managed less than half of that figure, closer to a third, in fact, which is undeniably disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjabi film box office in India has fallen off from the highs of the 2010s, when the business was growing and sort of peaked towards the end of the decade. The quality of films aside, one of the major driving factors is demographic change. A sustained wave of emigration in the late 2010s and early 2020s has reshaped the core audience base. A large chunk of the business has shifted from India to overseas markets like Canada and Australia. It is now common for overseas collections to be multiple times higher than those in India. In contrast, pre-COVID, the business used to be more domestic-heavy, with rarely any film collecting more overseas than in India.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the industry is facing a double whammy by missing out on some potential big grossers that have not secured a release in India due to external factors, such as featuring Pakistani artists (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/sardaar-ji-3-box-office-diljit-dosanjh-starrer-becomes-highest-grossing-punjabi-film-overseas-surpassing-jatt-and-juliet-3-1394701">Sardaar Ji 3</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/chal-mera-putt-4-box-office-fourth-biggest-opening-weekend-for-a-punjabi-film-1395062">Chal Mera Putt 4</a>) or facing censor issues (Punjab 95). Audiences are also not as keen on giving original films a chance as they were in the previous decade, with comedy sequels being the only ones getting traction from time to time. However, lately, even some of these comedy sequels are failing, with Bambukat 2 seemingly the latest addition to that list.</p>

The drop from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-worldwide-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-films-rakes-in-rs-68-cr-in-first-week-1400915">Thursday</a> was 25-30 per cent. Films these days tend to stay flat on Fridays, especially those catering to bigger centres. However, since O&rsquo; Romeo had a partial holiday on Thursday and a BOGO offer was in effect on weekdays, which kept the business elevated. As such, a drop was largely expected, but it could have been softer at around 10-15 per cent. What it has is a bit excessive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was competition from two new releases, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/do-deewane-sheher-mein-advance-booking-siddhant-chaturvedi-and-mrunal-thakur-starrer-sells-10000-tickets-on-bookmyshow-1400903">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a> and Assi,&nbsp;but neither of the two got a start, and O&rsquo; Romeo remained the film with the most showcasing. The eight-day running total stands at Rs. 44 crore nett approx. The second weekend is expected to collect Rs. 8&nbsp;crore nett, which will take it around Rs. 50 crore by Sunday. The film is a FLOP, but since there won&rsquo;t be much going on at the box office till Dhurandhar: The Revenge and Toxic releases, it will possibly crawl its way towards Rs. 60 crore nett.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first weekend, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and Tuesday briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that, but the drop on Wednesday took that possibility away, and since then, it has only gone down.</p>

Makers reportedly censor sequel glimpse titled Dilli]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1222295385_kaithi-2-karthi-loki-webp.webp"></img><p>Kaithi, starring Karthi, has been a fan-favorite film of the actor, and many fans have been eagerly waiting for its sequel. As the film&rsquo;s future remains unclear, a recent report has surfaced online indicating a possible sequel.</p>

<p><strong>Is Karthi&rsquo;s Kaithi 2 set to be launched soon?</strong></p>

<p>According to online reports, the makers of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/is-kaithi-2-still-on-cards-karthi-breaks-silence-after-lokesh-kanagaraj-announces-next-movie-aa23-with-allu-arjun-1400006">Kaithi</a>, Dream Warrior Pictures, have reportedly censored a video glimpse titled Dilli. The 30-second promo is expected to mark the announcement of the sequel and was reportedly certified by the board on February 19, 2026.</p>

<p>While there has been no official confirmation, it is worth noting that in Kaithi, Karthi played the character Dilli, who became a fan favorite. The project later evolved into the Lokesh Kanagaraj Cinematic Universe (LCU).</p>

<p>Earlier in January, Karthi was asked whether Kaithi 2 would happen. However, the actor revealed that he was not aware of any developments and said that only Lokesh Kanagaraj could provide a clear answer.</p>

<p><strong>More about Kaithi</strong></p>

<p>Directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/lokesh-kanagaraj-breaks-his-silence-about-quitting-kaithi-2-will-not-leave-without-completing-kaithi-2-vikram-2-rolex-1400209">Lokesh Kanagaraj</a>, Kaithi follows the story of an ex-convict, Dilli, who is forced to help a police officer while a mafia group is hot on their heels.</p>

<p>With Karthi in the lead role, the film features an ensemble cast including Narain, Arjun Das, Harish Uthaman, and George Maryan, among others, in pivotal roles.</p>

<p>The action thriller marked the first installment in the Lokesh Kanagaraj Cinematic Universe, which was later expanded with Vikram, starring Kamal Haasan, and Leo, starring Vijay.</p>

<p>Moreover, the upcoming film Benz, starring Raghava Lawrence and Nivin Pauly, is also set to be part of the LCU.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was speculated that Lokesh Kanagaraj would begin work on Kaithi 2 after wrapping up Coolie. However, the filmmaker recently announced that his next movie will be the Allu Arjun starrer, tentatively titled AA23 (LK07), marking his directorial debut in Telugu cinema.</p>

<p><strong>Karthi&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vaa-vaathiyaar-review-karthi-starrer-offers-a-fresh-idea-that-turns-loud-corny-and-forgettable-1400265">Karthi</a> was last seen in the lead role in Vaa Vaathiyaar. Directed by Nalan Kumarasamy, the film focuses on a police officer who is influenced by his grandfather to adopt elements of the late M. G. Ramachandran&rsquo;s cinematic characters.</p>

<p>As a result, the officer develops an alter ego that fights against wrongdoers while masquerading as an MGR-inspired character. Apart from the Thozha actor, the film also stars Krithi Shetty, Sathyaraj, Shilpa Manjunath, and Rajkiran in key roles.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Karthi will appear in the spy action drama Sardar 2, and he is currently working on Marshal.</p>

During the interaction, the Rebel Star spoke about his initial plan to appear in three films in 2026 to offer more to his fans. However, despite working on three projects, only two have managed to hit theaters this year.</p>

<p><strong>Prabhas on the initial plan to release 3 movies in 2026</strong></p>

<p>Speaking with the team of Couple Friendly, actor Santosh Sobhan expressed his admiration for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/prasanth-varmas-prabhas-starrer-baka-shelved-after-hanu-man-and-rakshas-troubles-report-1400885">Prabhas</a> and his films. In response, the Baahubali actor said that he wishes to do more films for his fans. However, despite working on three projects, only two of them will be released this year due to scheduling constraints.</p>

<p>The actor said, &ldquo;I know what you all want. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying to make three movies per year. But due to release schedules, only two are coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From Prabhas&rsquo; lineup this year, The Raja Saab was released in theaters during Sankranti, while Fauzi is expected to hit the big screens during Dussehra 2026. Earlier, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/spirit-release-date-prabhas-and-sandeep-reddy-vangas-cop-action-drama-to-hit-screens-on-march-5-2027-1399970">Spirit</a>&nbsp;was slated to release in 2026; however, the makers have officially announced that the film will now release on March 5, 2027.</p>

<p>Prabhas was last seen in the lead role in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/the-raja-saab-ott-release-when-and-where-to-watch-prabhas-starrer-horror-comedy-online-after-28-days-of-theatrical-run-1400344">The Raja Saab</a>. Directed by Maruthi, the horror-comedy revolves around Raja and his rivalry with his late grandfather, a malevolent spirit who haunts a mansion.</p>

<p>Apart from the Saaho actor, the film also starred Sanjay Dutt, Nidhhi Agerwal, Malavika Mohanan, and Riddhi Kumar, among others, in key roles. The film received an underwhelming response from both critics and audiences upon its release. It is currently available for streaming on JioHotstar.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the actor will appear in Fauzi, a period epic. The film features him as a soldier of the Azad Hind Force and presents an alternative, fictionalized retelling of historical events.</p>

<p>The movie is set to feature internet sensation Imanvi as the female lead, with veteran actors Mithun Chakraborty, Jaya Prada, and Anupam Kher appearing in key roles.</p>

<p>Additionally, the actor will also star in Spirit, a cop action drama directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, co-starring Triptii Dimri.</p>

<p>Previously, in November 2025, her management label confirmed that she was expecting her first child and requested an understanding regarding the confidentiality of the due date and other such details.

Pinkvilla has exclusively learnt that the trailer of the Ranveer Singh-led spectacle is slated to drop in the first week of March, around March 5, perfectly setting the stage for its grand Eid release.</p>

<p>According to a source close to the development, Dhurandhar 2 promises to be bigger, grander, and far more intense.&nbsp;&quot;The scale of the second part surpasses the first film in every aspect...from action to emotions&nbsp;and world-building. The team has expanded it like never before, and the trailer will give audiences a solid glimpse into the evolved world of Dhurandhar,&quot; revealed an insider.</p>

<p>The trailer is said to feature brand-new visuals that introduce unexplored territories&nbsp;within the narrative. However, what is truly grabbing attention in early previews is Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s fierce transformation. &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-ranveer-singh-walks-out-of-don-3-amidst-dhurandhar-success-hunt-for-a-new-don-begins-1399363">Ranveer Singh</a> is undoubtedly the highlight of the trailer. His screen presence and physical transformation as Lyari&rsquo;s King is&nbsp;being raved about internally. He brings a certain gravitas&nbsp;that will elevate&nbsp;the sequel to another level,&rdquo; the source added.</p>

<p>Insiders suggest that the trailer cut has been designed massively, without revealing too much of it. With its strategic early-March launch, the makers aim to build&nbsp;momentum&nbsp;for Eid release, positioning Dhurandhar 2 as one of the biggest cinematic events of the year.</p>

<p>If early reactions within the industry are anything to go by, the roar is about to echo louder than ever!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Directed by National Award-winning filmmaker Aditya Dhar, and produced by Jio Studios and B62 Studios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wuthering Heights should aim for a spike in its second weekend in order to escalate its lifetime target. Based on the current trends, the movie is looking for a finish under Rs. 5 crore only.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking with Mirchi Plus while promoting her new release, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/mrunal-thakur-reflects-on-arranged-marriage-amid-dating-rumors-with-dhanush-if-everyone-is-on-board-1400913">Mrunal Thakur</a> said, &ldquo;Dhanush sir&hellip; I mean, after watching Raayan, Maari, Raanjhanaa, and Captain Miller, I am a big fan of his. Oh my God, Asuran is something I can watch multiple times. He&rsquo;s such an institution, and it takes so much for an actor to be that way and to bring out such performances from other actors too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It so happened that while they were shooting Tere Ishk Mein, I said, &lsquo;Sir, can you please come for the screening of Son of Sardaar?&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know he would actually come. He just came, and I was so happy. I felt it was really sweet. I really wish to work with him one day,&rdquo; the actress added.</p>

<p>For those unaware, Mrunal Thakur and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/after-ranveer-singh-and-vikram-is-director-shankar-eyeing-dhanush-for-magnum-opus-velpari-find-out-1400869">Dhanush</a> have been reportedly seeing each other. While rumors even surfaced that both of them might tie the knot soon, the actress herself dismissed the reports.</p>

<p><strong>Mrunal Thakur and Dhanush&rsquo;s work front</strong></p>

<p>Mrunal Thakur recently appeared in the lead role in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/3-hindi-movies-releasing-this-week-in-theaters-do-deewane-seher-mein-to-assi-and-veer-murarbaji-the-battle-of-purandar-1400789">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a>, co-starring Siddhant Chaturvedi. The romantic drama follows the story of two socially awkward millennials in Mumbai who find love while struggling with self-acceptance.

As the spiritual sequel has completed two weeks at the box office, the crime thriller has added Rs 25 lakh to its total collections.</p>

<p>During the first week of its release, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/vadh-2-box-office-sanjay-mishra-collects-rs-1-20-crore-in-two-days-1400560">Sanjay Mishra</a> and Neena Gupta starrer collected a total of Rs 3.05 crore. With the second week&rsquo;s collections included, the total cume of the movie stands at Rs 3.30 crore. As the movie continues its run despite new releases like O Romeo and Tu Yaa Main, the film is targeting an Rs 3.50 crore finish at the box office.</p>

<p>Backed by Luv Films, the film had a promising start, but since then, it has seen an ordinary trend at the box office. When compared to the original film, the spiritual sequel has performed far better, with the first installment wrapping up its entire run at around Rs 65 lakh only.</p>

Directed by Jeethu Joseph, the upcoming film will mark the franchise&rsquo;s final installment, with huge expectations riding on it.</p>

<p>As the release is just months away, the film&rsquo;s plot has reportedly surfaced online. Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>

<p><strong>Did Mohanlal starrer Drishyam 3 plot leak online?</strong></p>

<p>According to a report by Movies Singapore, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/drishyam-3-release-date-mohanlal-confirms-georgekutty-to-return-to-the-big-screen-on-april-2-2026-1400777">Drishyam 3</a> once again follows the story of Georgekutty. The film is said to focus not only on protecting his family from the world but also on shielding them from the truth and the burden of what binds them together.</p>

<p>As a new force begins to close in on him and his family, Georgekutty reportedly witnesses cracks in his carefully crafted plan, with adversaries who are more determined and organized than ever before.</p>

<p>With the walls closing in around his conscience, his relationships, and the fragile normalcy he has worked so hard to build, the threat is no longer merely external. The film is said to explore how much more the man is willing to sacrifice for the sake of his loved ones. However, this remains an unconfirmed plot, and an official update is still awaited.</p>

<p><strong>More about Drishyam 3</strong></p>

<p>Drishyam 3 is the upcoming installment in the crime thriller franchise directed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/will-drishyam-3-be-the-endgame-jeethu-joseph-breaks-silence-on-mohanlals-crime-thriller-1400429">Jeethu Joseph</a>.&nbsp;The original Drishyam follows the story of Georgekutty, a middle-class man who leads a modest life with his wife and daughters.</p>

<p>Their lives take a drastic turn when Georgekutty and his family come under suspicion after IG Geetha Prabhakar&rsquo;s son, Varun Prabhakar, goes missing. With several clues pointing toward Georgekutty&rsquo;s involvement, the film explores the truth and how the family navigates an intense investigation.</p>

<p>Released in 2021, Drishyam 2 continued the narrative by exploring new dimensions of the story. With the third installment, the franchise is expected to delve into yet another chapter in the family&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Apart from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/l366-first-look-mohanlal-introduced-as-pure-love-ts-lovelajan-in-tharun-moorthys-cop-action-comedy-1400310">Mohanlal</a>, the third film will feature Meena, Ansiba Hassan, Esther Anil, Asha Sharath, Murali Gopy, and Siddique, among others, reprising their previous roles. The film is scheduled to hit theatres on April 2, 2026.</p>

<p>Later, the Hindi remake, also titled Drishyam 3 and starring Ajay Devgn, is set to release on October 2, 2026.</p>

Giving an insight as to what may have brought the change and how her decision was based on opportunities back home, she shared her opinions on choosing what felt &lsquo;exciting&rsquo; for her at the time, and wanting to explore other options.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Priyanka Chopra talks about moving away from Bollywood due to its limitations</strong></p>

<p>After working in the Hindi film industry for many years, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/vin-diesel-praises-priyanka-chopra-jonas-incredible-talent-at-the-bluff-premiere-shes-amazing-in-the-film-1400850">Priyanka Chopra</a> moved abroad and took on English-language projects. Opening up about how the plan was to seek more chances that would break away from the limited possibilities being presented to her in Bollywood and how she felt being &lsquo;pushed&rsquo; into doing so, the actress shared to Firstpost how the journey has been. She said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever wanted to leave Bollywood. I felt limited for many reasons when I was working in Hindi films. I was being pushed into&hellip; I was looking for opportunities that felt exciting to me as an artist and I landed up working in America.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shift has not been easy as the actress juggles between India and Los Angeles, shooting for a SS Rajamouli project while promoting her latest work, The Bluff. However, the 43-year-old is finding momentum in having the choice and loves to be back to her country at the same time. &ldquo;I am really excited to be doing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/varanasi-priyanka-chopra-jonas-calls-mahesh-babu-starrer-a-career-defining-film-says-ss-rajamouli-is-the-best-in-india-1400872">Varanasi</a> in India again. I would hate to have to choose between the two. I straddle both the worlds and I enjoy working in both the industries. They are both different in many ways just as cultures,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>The actress moved to the West over a decade ago and started off her career there with projects like Quantico, and has continued to maintain double bases in India and the US. Following her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-recalls-hurtful-scrutiny-around-marriage-to-nick-jonas-rubbed-people-the-wrong-way-1400668">marriage to Nick Jonas</a>, the couple has welcomed daughter Malti Marie, whom they&rsquo;re raising together in California.</p>

The romantic drama collected Rs. 11.50&nbsp; crore in its second week, bringing the two 14-day cume to Rs. 26.50 crore gross at the Indian box office.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Madhan directorial recorded a drop of 20 percent from the previous week, which is a strong hold to say the least.&nbsp; The jump was majorly due to Valentine&#39;s Day week and the positive word-of-mouth among the audience.</p>

<p>It is expected to see a good spike in its third weekend. However, it will have to face new releases including Thalapathy Vijay&#39;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/ghilli-box-office-collections-thalapathy-vijay-starrer-obilterate-opening-record-for-indian-re-releases-1297720">Ghilli </a>re-release. If the movie sustained well in its third week and performed on a similar pace, it might end of doing Rs. 40 crore in its final run.

The couple that has long kept the details of its nuptials private, however, an alleged look at their wedding invitation card, including date, time, location, and concerned contact numbers, was shared online. Now, owing to the heightened interest, the two have decided to hire an international security firm to handle their celebrations, as reported by India Today.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna plan tight security for the wedding day</strong></p>

<p>With under a week left to their marriage ceremony, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/vijay-deverakonda-rashmika-mandanna-net-worth-inside-soon-to-wed-couples-reported-rs-133-cr-combined-fortune-1400858">Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna</a> are having to deal with a lot of security issues. Every day, a new detail of their wedding is being shared on the internet, and now the duo has sought the help of a global team to help them with the management of any possible breaches on their big day. They will also be in touch with local authorities to ensure the smooth progression of the festivities. The two actors wish for utmost protection so as to maintain the intimate nature of their nuptials and have taken additional precautions to ensure so.</p>

<p>A source close to the couple shared, &ldquo;To secure the perimeter of the palace, a specialised agency from abroad has been hired. They will be collaborating with local Rajasthan security to assure absolute privacy of the events.&rdquo; The couple wished for absolute privacy of their wedding, with earlier reports suggesting that NDAs were signed by involved parties, including vendors and guests who were asked to be discreet about the same. A no-phone rule has been implemented at the wedding for all attendees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, it was noted that following the main ceremony on February 26 in Udaipur, which will be an intimate affair, a big reception will be held in Hyderabad on March 4 for friends and industry colleagues. Vijay Deverakonda and Rashmika Mandanna have previously worked together on Geetha Govindam and Dear Comrade, and have kept their relationship under the radar so far.&nbsp;</p>

Combined with Rs. 51 crore (Rs. 42.50 crore nett) from the domestic market of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-nets-rs-42-cr-in-first-week-in-india-1400911">India</a>, that amounts to Rs. 68.25 crore worldwide box office gross.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">While the first week&#39;s business in India is similar to Shahid Kapoor&rsquo;s other recent film Teri Baaton Main Uljha Jiya, which released in February 2024. The overseas business fell short of USD 2.80 million in the first week, which Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya had. It&rsquo;s not like Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya had done particularly strongly overseas; its performance was termed decent to good, while O Romeo is below par. The shortfall was pretty much all across the board, with the Middle East being somewhat closer, while the United States showed the largest gap, being around half of TBMAUJ, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia - New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya went on to have solid legs, nearly doubling its first week business, to collect Rs. 82.50 crore nett in India and USD 5.35 million overseas, giving it a Rs. 143 crore worldwide sum. O&rsquo; Romeo is not expected to do that and will probably end up being closer to half of that overseas and around Rs. 60-65 crore nett in India, for over/under Rs. 100 crore mark worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Given its relatively higher costs, O&rsquo; Romeo ideally needed to outperform Teri Baaton Main Aisa Uljha Jiya, not fall short of it.</p>

While many speculated that a wedding is on the cards for the celebs, the Do Deewane Seher Mein actress was quick to state that she hasn&rsquo;t found the right person yet. Now, Mrunal shared her opinions on arranged marriage, stating that she&rsquo;s open to it. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Mrunal Thakur on arranged marriage</strong></h3>

<p>Do Deewane Seher Mein co-stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/mrunal-thakur-says-marriage-is-on-the-cards-after-denying-feb-14-wedding-to-dhanush-do-it-with-right-person-1400736">Mrunal Thakur</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/amid-dating-rumors-with-dhanush-mrunal-thakur-gets-teased-by-siddhant-chaturvedi-for-a-chennai-question-1400474">Siddhant Chaturvedi</a> were in a conversation with Showshaa India. During the chat, the actress revealed that she is open to arranged marriage. She divulged that plans for her wedding are like daydreaming in her parents&rsquo; minds, and the wedding bells are always ringing.</p>

<p>Sharing a personal anecdote, Thakur said that her father recently told her to settle down. In response, she requested him to call his sister and ask if she knows a good guy for his daughter. &ldquo;He asked, &lsquo;Where is the guy?&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;Exactly, where is the guy?&rsquo; If you&rsquo;re asking me this, what should I say then? This is every household&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; she shared with the publication.</p>

<p>During the candid conversation about marriage and life partners, the Jersey actress mentioned that she is not scared of arranged marriage at all. But it&rsquo;s that there simply aren&rsquo;t any matches for her. She thinks marriage isn&rsquo;t something one should do just for the sake of it. Unlike earlier, now even friends set people up. No matter what form of arrangement it is, love or arranged, if two people connect and click, that&rsquo;s what counts; otherwise, nothing works for her.</p>

<p>While the two prospective partners need to connect, it&rsquo;s also important for the families to agree too. &ldquo;Because marriage is not just between a man and a woman, it&rsquo;s between two families. If everyone is on board, then why not?&rdquo; concluded Mrunal.</p>

<p>On the work front, Mrunal&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/do-deewane-seher-mein-teaser-out-siddhant-chaturvedi-mrunal-thakurs-imperfectly-perfect-love-story-to-release-on-valentines-day-1400032">Do Deewane Seher Mein</a> hit cinemas today.

After completing his post-graduation in business management, he wants to take over his father&rsquo;s business. However, his father asks him to find a good job elsewhere.</p>

<p>To prove himself as a worthy successor, Krishna joins an NGO as a business consultant. The NGO is managed by Mithra, and he eventually falls in love with her. Just when everything seems to be going well, Krishna&rsquo;s father suffers a heart attack, and the doctors advise him to take bed rest for a few months.</p>

<p>With his father forced to rest, Krishna decides to run the family business. What happens after he takes charge forms the rest of the story.</p>

The film dropped around 10 per cent from the previous day, although the real value drop was more than that. It was a holiday in Maharashtra, which kept the business flat in the state, maybe even a minor growth, while elsewhere it dropped closer to 15-20 per cent. Apart from that, the film also had a BOGO offer going on, which has kept business elevated throughout weekdays.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the second week, the film faces two new films, Assi and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/do-deewane-sheher-mein-advance-booking-siddhant-chaturvedi-and-mrunal-thakur-starrer-sells-10000-tickets-on-bookmyshow-1400903">Do Deewane Sehere Mein</a>, but both of these are smaller releases, and O&rsquo; Romeo remains the film with the most showcasing. Generally, films with BOGO offer&nbsp;on weekdays have muted growth over the weekend as the offer is removed; however, the film seems to be continuing the offer, so growth may be closer to normal. The film will most likely cross Rs. 50 crore nett on Sunday and is headed for Rs. 60-65 crore closing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After the kind of trend the film showed over its first <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-film-drops-sharply-on-sunday-nets-rs-27-50-cr-first-weekend-in-india-1400782">weekend</a>, it seemed that reaching Rs. 50 crore nett would be a difficult task, if not entirely impossible. However, with the support of the BOGO offer and some external push, the film will now manage to get there. Not that it changes anything for the overall picture. It is an expensive film for its worth at face value, which needed much more than Rs. 50 crore, double that at least. The sudden, surprising holds on Monday and Tuesday briefly made it seem like it could get closer to that. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/o-romeo-box-office-collections-shahid-kapoor-tripti-dimri-drops-on-wednesday-nears-rs-40-cr-in-six-days-1400877">Wednesday</a> drop has again made that possibility unlikely, and now Thursday has taken the film further down.</p>

His last moments were in the presence of his family, including two daughters, Billie and Georgia, and close friends. The actor was 53 and had previously announced his <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-wishes-als-diagnosis-is-not-the-end-of-my-story-promises-hes-capable-of-more-1391338">diagnosis in April 2025</a>. Tributes for his time in the acting world began pouring in almost immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane&rsquo;s peers remember the actor following his passing</strong></p>

<p>Euphoria creator Sam Levinson revealed he is &lsquo;heartbroken&rsquo; by the loss of his &lsquo;dear friend,&rsquo; and added, &quot;Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric&#39;s family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellow actors on Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens Jr. and Sarah Drew shared a photo of the star on their Instagram stories and wrote, &quot;Rest in Peace, Buddy,&quot; and &quot;Rest in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;RIP, Buddy. Me and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-juggles-relationships-with-3-women-amid-als-battle-all-about-ex-wife-gf-and-mystery-woman-1392001">Eric Dane</a> played brothers years ago in a beautiful movie called, Wedding Wars. Good guy. Too soon. Xo J,&rdquo; John Stamos wrote on his social media.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcher wrote on X (formerly Twitter) about how the Franklin strip fanatics fantasy football league will miss the star and is sure that he&rsquo;ll be watching from above. He also vowed to join the fight to solve ALS.</p>

<p>His Charmed co-star Alyssa Milano recalled his warm existence and love for his family, &quot;He loved the absurdity of things. He loved catching people off guard. And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca [Gayheart], everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren&#39;t present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. ... The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

The next day, the veteran Bollywood star underwent a procedure, and his condition is stable. On February 18, a doctor overseeing Salim Khan&rsquo;s health gave an update on his condition. But&nbsp;the Khan family was displeased by the statement. Hence, they have blocked any further updates on the&nbsp;screenwriter&rsquo;s health. Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Salman Khan&rsquo;s family blocks further health updates on Salim Khan</strong></h3>

<p>In a statement to Variety India, a source close to the family shared, &ldquo;Salman and his family were displeased with the doctor&rsquo;s public statement and have clearly conveyed to the authorities that they do not want any further details disclosed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The insider further added that since health is a private matter, no updates should have been shared in public, and the decision to make any communications about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khans-father-salim-khan-undergoes-angiography-doctor-hopeful-about-taking-him-off-ventilator-on-february-19-1400848">Salim Khan</a>&rsquo;s health should be left entirely to the family. Having said that, the unnamed source acknowledged the fact that, owing to the screenwriter and the Khan family&rsquo;s popularity, the public is curious to know about his well-being.</p>

<p>However, &ldquo;medical information is a confidential matter. The family wants to avoid any unnecessary speculation or media scrutiny surrounding Salim Khan&rsquo;s condition,&rdquo; the source added.</p>

<p><strong>Doctor&rsquo;s update on Salim Khan&rsquo;s health</strong></p>

<p>The doctor from Lilavati Hospital shared that a Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) procedure was performed by a neurosurgeon on Salim Khan. He also informed, &ldquo;The procedure has been accomplished, he is fine, he is stable, he is being shifted to the ICU, and by tomorrow (February 19), I think we will get him off the ventilator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The healthcare provider underlined that the senior star has been doing quite well. &ldquo;Age is a factor we understand, that is why the process of recovery takes a little time,&rdquo; he divulged.</p>

<p>On the day of his hospitalization, the doctors saw him in the casualty. They later took him to the ICU. According to the hospital authorities, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salim-khan-hospitalised-salman-khan-alvira-agnihotri-aayush-sharma-and-other-family-members-visit-him-1400817">Salman Khan</a>&rsquo;s father was having jerks, and his blood pressure was high. Since they wanted to do certain investigations on him, they put him on the ventilator.</p>

<p>Since then, Salman, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salim-khan-hospitalised-sohail-khan-arrives-with-seema-nirvaan-to-see-father-salma-khan-helen-sshura-join-1400855">Sohail Khan</a>, Arpita Khan Sharma, Alvira Agnihotri, Nirvaan Khan, Aayush Sharma, Helen, Salma Khan, and other family members have arrived at the hospital to meet him.

However, one point of discussion remains how involved BTS member V was in it which Min Hee Jin has previously used to her advantage. Now, a conversation between the K-pop idol and the former CEO has revealed that the Layover singer once shared he found common points as well. However, the star himself has said that the submission of the chat as evidence was not with his consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>V expresses surprise over the use of private chat as &lsquo;evidence&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-how-members-reacted-to-rms-thoughts-of-disband-or-take-hiatus-livestream-itd-be-weird-if-you-1400720">BTS</a> member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-v-beats-ronaldo-and-messi-to-become-most-searched-celeb-of-2025-named-biggest-k-pop-star-on-list-1400364">V</a> has taken to his Instagram story to personally share his thoughts about a private conversation becoming privy to the world as part of an ongoing legal dispute. He quoted a report that said that the KakaoTalk messages between BTS member V and Min Hee Jin were also accepted as evidence. In the text, following message was written, &lsquo;(There&#39;s always talk of plagiarism, and it&#39;s not once not been mentioned) Huh... that&rsquo;s what. I took a look as well and thought, &lsquo;Oh, this is kinda similar&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of relying on his agency to comment on the issue, V took the matter into his own hands. Taking a stand against the use of his chat without his permission, he wrote on his social media handle, &ldquo;This is part of a private, everyday conversation that I shared with empathy, as they were my acquaintance. I have no intention of taking sides. However, I find it very upsetting (surprised, or embarrassed, or taken aback) that the conversation in question was submitted as evidence without my consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTS is all set to release a new album called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-if-theyll-submit-arirang-for-grammy-rm-reacts-to-k-pop-nods-dont-want-to-be-desperately-1400723">ARIRANG</a> on March 20, 2026, which be followed by a world tour across 81 stops in 34 cities.

According to a PEOPLE report, the popular actor was said to have passed away that afternoon in the presence of his friends and family. A note from his family confirmed that his demise came following his &lsquo;courageous battle&rsquo; with ALS. His family has asked to keep the rest of the details private as they mourn the loss.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane dies at 53 following nearly a year-long fight with ASL</strong></p>

<p>Back in April 2025, the star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-wishes-als-diagnosis-is-not-the-end-of-my-story-promises-hes-capable-of-more-1391338">revealed his diagnosis</a> and was met with an outpouring of support and encouragement from his many fans around the world. The actor went on to speak about his wishes to fight the battle as much as possible. Confirming his passing, his family shared, &quot;With heavy hearts, we share that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-juggles-relationships-with-3-women-amid-als-battle-all-about-ex-wife-gf-and-mystery-woman-1392001">Eric Dane</a> passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS. He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world.&quot;</p>

<p>They reiterated his passionate advocacy for &lsquo;awareness and research&rsquo; about ALS, and added, &ldquo;[He was] determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he&rsquo;s received. The family has asked for privacy as they navigate this impossible time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actor was previously supposed to be at the ALS Network Champions for Cures &amp; Care Gala in early February, but could not, due to the realities of his condition. Former Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy co-star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/ellen-pompeo-reveals-chat-with-greys-anatomy-co-star-eric-dane-on-his-asl-diagnosis-phone-rang-30-seconds-later-1400442">Ellen Pompeo</a> went on to speak about their call after his ALS diagnosis announcement, and there were no updates on him since.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was previously married to actress Rebecca Gayheart, and the duo shares two children, daughters Billie and Georgia, born in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Following their divorce in 2018, she asked for it to be dismissed in March 2025. The Euphoria star is said to have been in an on-and-off relationship with director and photographer Janell Shirtcliff for over three years before his health update. He was also involved with Priya Jain, a 28-year-old actress, although they are said to have separated in June 2025.</p>

The drop from the previous week is around Rs. 60&nbsp;percent. With two new releases coming this weekend, Mardaani 3 is now in its final legs at the box office.&nbsp;</p>

It is only Rs. 1 crore away from surpassing the final earnings of Mardaani 2, which netted Rs. 46.30 crore in 2019. Based on the current trends, Mardaani 3 should emerge as the biggest grosser of the franchise in its 4th weekend itself. It is likely to wind its entire run around Rs. 48 crore to Rs. 50 crore nett in India.</p>

<p>It will be a good result for Mardaani 3, as business has gone down severely for mid-sized films in the post-pandemic times. Even&nbsp;A-list starrers are struggling to find the audience. In such times, if a female-led movie managing to recover its cost of production, its a success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that has been going wrong with films lately is that the costs have increased a lot. A film that used to cost x a couple of years ago has increased to 2x, some even going 3x.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-starrer-cop-actioner-remains-flat-on-3rd-tuesday-cume-over-rs-44-crore-1400836" onclick="triggerArticleInterlinkClick('article_interlink_click','Mardaani 3 Box Office Collections: Rani Mukerji's cop drama continues steady run, nets Rs 45 lakh on 3rd Wednesday','1400868','https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerji-starrer-cop-actioner-remains-flat-on-3rd-tuesday-cume-over-rs-44-crore-1400836','articlepage','/entertainment/box-office/mardaani-3-box-office-collections-rani-mukerjis-cop-drama-continues-steady-run-nets-rs-45-lakh-on-3rd-wednesday-1400868','Mardaani 3','Body_Hyperlink','entertainment','box-office');">Mardaani 3</a>&nbsp;has done well in this regard as the film has been made in controlled budget. While it does cost 2x of Mardaani 2, the film had solid non-theatrical recoveries, so overall recovery wasn&rsquo;t an issue. The theatrical recovery will be quite decent at around Rs. 25 crore and will end up as a profitable venture.</p>
