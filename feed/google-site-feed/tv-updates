It is a tattoo of Tejasswi&#39;s face, but it is not a permanent one.&rdquo; He further mentioned that it&rsquo;s actually for promoting Tejasswi&#39;s show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is me showing support for her. The event was actually the launch of the show, and the character in the show gets a tattoo of her face. Hence, I put it on. But it&rsquo;s not a real tattoo,&rdquo; he clarified.</p>

<p><strong>Bhavya Singh shares that Divya Agarwal is living&nbsp;separately from husband in an explosive rant</strong></p>

<p>Getting between fellow participants Archana Gautam and Bhavya Singh&rsquo;s friendship, Divya Agarwal made strong-worded comments about them, and the three got involved in an argument. A follow-up chat, including Bhavya Singh, Sapna Choudhary, and Aarya, the former Splitsvilla Season 12 star, made shocking revelations about Divya. She went on a rant about her personal life while denying wanting to go into detail about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Diwali par asli phatake toh iske ghar par poothe the. Aur maine phode the. Aur aaj tak maine kabhi bola nahi woh aur na kabhi podcast par na kabhi kuch. Kabhi bolungi bhi nahi, kyunki inka khud ka aapsi parivaarik maamla tha, usmein mujhe involve kar diya in logon ne.

They beg people in Mumbai, saying, &lsquo;Come to my house, please come to me, please meet me.&rsquo; She lives separately from her husband.)&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Divya Agarwal was not privy to the conversation, it is unknown if she will find out about it or react to it.

Bajaj and Darbar exclusively sat with Pinkvilla recently and talked about various aspects of their life- career, love, heartbreaks and what not.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">When asked how to deal with heartbreaks, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-bigg-boss-19-fame-abhishek-bajaj-responds-to-ex-wife-akanksha-jindals-claims-kaam-dhandha-dhoondhna-1398400">Abhishek </a>said, &ldquo;You have to fill that void with yourself. You have to start doing things which make you happy. And wo baar baar aapko karna padega. You have to keep reminding yourself that you are enough.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Sitting next to him, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-exclusive-awez-darbar-denies-being-in-10-year-relationship-or-begging-asli-saanp-amaal-malik-for-work-1397369">Awez </a>added, &ldquo;Creative cheezein karo, usse kya hota hai aap time bhi waste nahi kar rahe ho, you are working on yourself and healing at the same time. Best cheez hai wo. Productive cheezein karo, matlab bathroom mein shower me rona is one thing, gaana lagake sunte rahna, zoned out rahna, galat cheezein karna, usse better hai ki you should work on yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(Do creative things, what happens is that you are not even wasting time, you are working on yourself and healing at the same time. That is the best thing. Do productive things, that means crying in the shower in the bathroom is one thing, listening to music, being zoned out, doing wrong things, it is better that you should work on yourself.)&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Abhishek further revealed that heartbreaks helped him as an actor. He said, &ldquo;I have evolved as an actor because of heartbreak. Mujhe kabhi pata hi nahi tha main likh bhi sakta hu. I took 55 days to write a film. Poora maine research kiya ki uske seven acts hote hain, first act mein kya hota hai, second me kya. I have built the characters, I have written everything. That means, rather than losing yourself, you should try to find yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Awez Darbar recommended traveling whenever one goes through such lows in life. He said, &ldquo;Aise mein travel karna chahiye. Because traveling heals you. You start learning new things when you see other people doing other things.&nbsp;</p>

Here's what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/829343798_ekta-1.webp"></img><p>Naagin is Ektaa Kapoor&rsquo;s popular television series that created a lot of buzz ever since its release in 2015. Last year, the show premiered its seventh season with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/priyanka-chahar-choudhary-reacts-to-pressure-of-leading-naagin-7-after-mouni-roy-tejasswi-prakash-im-focused-on-bringing-my-own-1399506">Priyanka Chahar Choudhary</a> playing the shape-shifting serpent in Naagin 7. After its successful run on TV, it seems like Kapoor is all set to take the franchise&nbsp;to the big screen. Read on for more details.</p>

<h3><strong>Ektaa Kapoor&#39;s Naagin to release in theaters?</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/naagin-7-arjun-bijlani-has-a-demand-from-ektaa-kapoor-as-latter-discusses-new-season-of-her-show-with-tejasswi-prakash-watch-1377517">Ektaa Kapoor</a> is the brain behind TV serials like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii, Kasautii Zindagii Kay, and more. Naagin is also one of her creations that became a rage among TV watchers in India. Hence, the show was revived for its seventh season in 2025. Looking at the massive fan following of the supernatural fiction series, Kapoor is thinking of taking the show to theaters.</p>

<p>An industry insider recently informed India Today that Kapoor, through her production house, Balaji Telefilms Limited, is in talks to take the Naagin franchise beyond television. The source revealed that given the brand&rsquo;s long-standing popularity and cinematic scale, the makers are exploring the possibility of adapting the franchise into a feature film, intending to reimagine the mythology for the big screen.</p>

<p>Having said that, the informant also said that the conversation is in the initial stage. &ldquo;But with the experience the team has had building seven successful seasons, it seems like the plan will turn into reality soon,&rdquo; added the insider.</p>

<p>With all eyes on Ektaa&rsquo;s TV show, reports suggest that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/shraddha-kapoor-was-sold-the-instant-she-was-approached-with-naagins-script-reveals-nikhil-dwivedi-find-out-her-reaction-1358439">Shraddha Kapoor</a> is all set to start filming her much-anticipated film, Nagin: An epic tale of love and sacrifice,&nbsp;in April 2026. A Mid-Day report suggested that Nagin, the film, has been in development for a long time, owing to the fact that the team wants to get everything right. &ldquo;With Shraddha locked in, the rest of the cast has fallen into place. The plan is to start shooting by April,&rdquo; said a source close to the film.</p>

<p>Producer Nikhil Dwivedi also revealed&nbsp;that Shraddha was excited to play the shapeshifting snake in their upcoming film. Apparently, she was the first one to come on board.</p>

Actress clarifies ‘relationship built on needs’ remark]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/1431663543_gaurav-khanna-and-akanksha-chamola.jpg"></img><p>Trouble in Paradise for Gaurav Khanna and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/who-is-akanksha-chamola-all-about-bigg-boss-19-contestant-gaurav-khannas-wife-whos-in-news-for-her-contrasting-views-on-kids-1396205">Akanksha Chamola</a>? The actor couple has long been the center of attention following his appearance on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-gaurav-khanna-gets-a-reality-check-as-wife-akanksha-chamola-advises-him-to-distance-himself-from-farrhana-bhatt-1398549">Bigg Boss 19</a>. With scrutiny around their views on parenthood, many have been closely monitoring their moves, and recently, the wife shared a quote on her Instagram, which had netizens wondering if she was directing it towards her husband or if issues were brewing for the couple. Speaking to Bombay Times, the actress assured they were not headed for divorce, and all was well back home.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Akanksha Chamola opens up on divorce rumors</strong></p>

<p>This past week, taking to her social media account, she wrote in Hindi, &ldquo;Jis rishte ki buniyaad mein sirf zarooratein ho, wahan dil hamesha qurbaan hota hai. (When a relationship is built only on needs, it is always the heart that gets sacrificed.)&rdquo; The post immediately received a multitude of likes and comments, prompting questions about a possible split. In a following update, Akanksha Chamola revealed that there is &lsquo;absolutely no trouble in our marriage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The actress seems to have decided to take a different route to promote her next work, which was unrelated to her Bigg Boss 19 winner husband. &ldquo;The post had nothing to do with Gaurav. I&rsquo;m not someone who discusses personal matters on social media. It was meant to promote my upcoming series. It was open to interpretation, but it was blown out of proportion,&rdquo; she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two were previously seen interacting on the set of the reality show, where he expressed his wish to have children and revealed that his wife&rsquo;s opinions did not match his own. His comments have been widely discussed online, with her now saying, &ldquo;I have clearly said that I don&rsquo;t see myself choosing motherhood. It&rsquo;s a personal choice, and I don&rsquo;t feel the need to justify it to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

From starting together on Dil Mill Gaye where they became close friends to re-establishing their relationship in more projects like Raisinghani vs Raisinghani.

Years after the show&#39;s end, fans have been linking them together with their joint work in Raisinghani vs Raisinghani only fueling the rumors of dating. On January 28, there were reports of the two planning a wedding this year.

The two said their I dos back in 2012 however it was a short-lived marriage as they jointly announced their plans for a divorce in November 2014, ending their relationship.

But for TV star Nakuul Mehta, it turned out to a curse. The actor recently spilled some tea from his early days, recalling how he was rejected by a popular Bollywood filmmaker for being &ldquo;too good-looking.&rdquo; Read on!</p>

<h3><strong>Nakuul Mehta recalls being rejected because of his good looks</strong></h3>

<p>In a candid conversation with News18, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-nakuul-mehta-on-donning-the-hat-of-host-for-crime-patrol-it-has-been-an-eye-opener-1321284">Nakuul Mehta</a> revealed that he once lost out on a film role because a Bollywood filmmaker thought he was &ldquo;too good-looking&rdquo; to play the part. Apparently, Mehta was about to play the role of a Rajasthani prince in the sequel to a &ldquo;really beautiful film&rdquo;. Dates were blocked, photoshoots were done, and things looked perfectly on track until a phone call changed everything.</p>

<p>The Ishqbaaaz actor further recalled that the unnamed director called him and casually dropped the bomb when he was attending an acting workshop. The filmmaker told Mehta, &ldquo;I was thinking about it. I think you&rsquo;re too good-looking for the part.&rdquo; A shocked Nakuul had nothing to say except an &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; The actor and host admitted he was left completely baffled because his good looks would be a disadvantage while playing a royal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I realised that he didn&rsquo;t have a better excuse to give. I didn&rsquo;t know what to make of that. I was like, what&rsquo;s he saying?&rdquo; shared the public figure. With that role off the chart, Mehta continued to focus on what was coming to him. He then shifted from TV and has steadily carved his own space in OTT.</p>

<p>On the work front, Nakuul Mehta was last seen in Space Gen: Chandrayaan, a series that explores India&rsquo;s ambitious lunar mission. The Arunabh Kumar creation has been earning appreciation for its storytelling. Backed by The Viral Fever, the series stars Nakuul Mehta and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/who-is-andrei-koscheev-meet-shriya-sarans-husband-3-years-younger-entrepreneur-and-tennis-player-1396833">Shriya Saran</a> in lead roles. The five-episode series also features actors like Prakash Belawadi, Danish Sait, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-amruta-khanvilkar-raazi-co-star-alia-bhatt-when-you-see-such-immense-talent-such-young-age-it">Amruta Khanvilkar</a>, Gopal Dutt, Meiyang Chang, Shreya Singh, Saurabh Dwivedi, Ishita Sharma, Uday Mahesh, and many others.</p>

Recently, Govinda reacted to Sunita&rsquo;s statement, calling it a part of an alleged conspiracy against him. He also dragged Krushna Abhishek into it,&nbsp;saying he is forced to insult him on TV. However, the comedian-actor reacted to it, saying that his uncle has next-level thoughts. Read on to know more!</p>

<h3><strong>Govinda claims Krushna Abhishek is forced to insult him on TV</strong></h3>

<p>In an earlier interview with ETimes, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-interview-sunita-ahuja-breaks-silence-on-family-fight-between-govinda-and-krushna-abhishek-1398321">Sunita Ahuja</a> said that she&rsquo;s been hearing about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sunita-ahuja-reveals-how-govindas-affair-rumors-affected-children-tina-and-yash-yeh-tumhari-umar-nahi-hai-1400007">Govinda</a>&rsquo;s controversy that he is having an affair with a girl. &ldquo;But I know that she&rsquo;s not an actress because actresses don&rsquo;t do such bad things. She doesn&rsquo;t love him; she only wants his money,&rdquo; stated the Bollywood wife.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Hero No. 1 actor reacted to her statement, calling it a plot in a bigger controversy. He also dragged his nephew <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-video-abhishek-kumar-makes-big-statement-about-krushna-abhishek-20-20-ghar-bana-liye-bezatti-karwa-ke-1391384">Krushna Abhishek</a> into it and stated that writers often force the comedian to say derogatory things about him to harm his reputation.</p>

<p>While talking to ANI, the Coolie No. 1 actor divulged, &ldquo;If you are a fan of Krushna&#39;s television shows, you&#39;ll see how the writers often force him to say things that make me feel insulted.&rdquo; He further revealed, telling Krushna to be cautious. But when he warned Krushna, his wife Sunita would get upset. &ldquo;Also, I don&rsquo;t know when these people would get upset with each other and when they are okay with each other. I&#39;m more of a steady person,&rdquo; stated the senior star.</p>

<p>Now, Krushna reacted to Govinda&rsquo;s statement, saying that he loves and respects his uncle. Calling him a legend, Entertainment actor Krushna opined that Govinda has &ldquo;next-level thoughts.&rdquo; This is probably the reason why he sees stuff on a different level. &ldquo;The same statement can look positive or sarcastic to different people. I take it positively,&rdquo; Krushna told Hindustan Times.</p>

Here’s what we know about Karan Johar, Salman Khan and Anil Kapoor-hosted show]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/1212484821_bigg-boss-ott.webp"></img><p>Bigg Boss OTT seems to have met its sad end. After three successful runs, the makers of the digital version of the popular reality show have shut the doors on any more instalments, if the latest reports are to be believed. According to the creator, Rishi Negi, who shared with SCREEN, the separate version aired only on OTT platforms Voot and then on JioCinema, will be canceled indefinitely.</p>

<p><strong>Bigg Boss OTT sees no future with closed doors on only-digital version of the popular reality show</strong></p>

<p>Last year, for the first time, the original ColorsTV show was made available on OTT platforms before being broadcast on televisions around the country for late-night viewing. It achieved shared success on TV and its digital platform, proving the popularity of the program among audiences. Speaking about the same, Rishi Negi shared, &ldquo;With the Hindi version, we have gone digital first last year. In effect, that becomes the property which first runs on JioHotstar and then comes on TV, and I think that&rsquo;s the cycle that will be followed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The digital-first way of running the business is likely to have caused the shutdown of the digital-only version of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/after-tanya-mittal-bigg-boss-19s-farrhana-bhatt-gets-accused-of-not-clearing-payments-heres-what-we-know-1400071">Bigg Boss</a>. The creator revealed how they have specific audiences for each of the platforms, which offers a diverse range of TV-watching and OTT-prefering target viewership. &ldquo;I believe there is a very large market at the OTT and TV level. The audience is very diverse, and they love watching the show on TV. My mother only watches Bigg Boss on TV.

A report by India Today stated that the comedian was rushed to the hospital early morning. It&rsquo;s noteworthy that she was supposed to film an episode for her TV show, Laughter Chefs, when Siingh went into labour.</p>

<p>Later that day, she delivered her second child, a baby boy. After recovering, the celebrity gave an update about her health to her fans via her YouTube blog. She also announced that their second son, Kaju, has arrived. It&#39;s noteworthy that the couple already has an elder son named Laksh aka Golla, who celebrates his birthday in April 2022.</p>

<p>With two kids to look after, Bharti and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/are-bharti-singh-and-haarsh-limbachiyaa-planning-a-third-child-already-couple-reveals-their-family-plans-1399138">Haarsh&nbsp;Limbachiyaa</a>&#39;s days must be getting over in a blink. Having said that, the couple would be on cloud nine, even while being surrounded by diapers and baby products. But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped them from thinking about a third baby.</p>

<p>In an earlier podcast with Bollywood actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sonali-bendre-calls-her-surgery-during-cancer-treatment-scary-reveals-most-interesting-fan-encounter-1301798">Sonali Bendre</a>, the couple indulged in a fun conversation, subtly speaking about their plans to have another child.

This time, Splitsvilla 16, aka MTV Splitsvilla X6, is going to be big on love and cash. In the first episode of the show that premiered on January 9, 2026, hosts Sunny Leone and Karan Kundrra introduced the contestants to this year&rsquo;s theme. Soon after, Karan&rsquo;s remark &ldquo;Maine toh Bigg Boss mein bhi Splitsvilla kar liya tha&rdquo; went viral.</p>

<h3><strong>Karan Kundrra says&nbsp;&ldquo;Maine toh Bigg Boss mein bhi Splitsvilla kar liya&rdquo;</strong></h3>

<p>MTV Splitsvilla is a show where contestants come to find true love. While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/karan-kundrra-slams-paid-trolls-for-spreading-breakup-rumors-with-tejasswi-prakash-says-it-annoys-me-1394536">Karan Kundrra</a> hosts the TV show that&rsquo;s all about love, he found his partner, actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/tejasswi-prakash-and-karan-kundrra-to-tie-knot-in-2026-bigg-boss-stars-reveals-wedding-plans-aise-bol-toh-rahe-hain-1398471">Tejasswi Prakash</a>, when he was part of Bigg Boss 15. While welcoming the contestants to Splitsvilla X6, Karan jokingly made the&nbsp;statement, &ldquo;Maine toh Bigg Boss mein bhi Splitsvilla kar liya tha.&rdquo; His dialogue struck a chord with many, going viral in no time.</p>

<p>Further, hosts Karan and Sunny Leone revealed that this time, the house is split into two. The Pyaar villa and Paisa villa. As the females made their way to the pyaar villa, they described the qualities they want to see in their guy. That&#39;s&nbsp;when contestant Deekha stated that she likes a bad guy who is good only for her.</p>

<p>Her statement took Karan back to the time when he had just met his ladylove. The popular TV actor stated that he turned into a good guy because of Tejasswi. &ldquo;When a bad guy turns good only for you, nothing in the world can change him, and I am saying this from my personal experience.&rdquo; Adding,&nbsp;Sunny also revealed that her husband, Daniel Weber, was once a bad guy, but he turned good for her.</p>

<p>By creating two separate villas, the makers have already added drama to the show. Having said that, they have also roped in Uorfi Javed and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/meet-actor-who-did-odd-jobs-desired-to-be-a-journalist-but-rose-to-stardom-by-playing-lead-role-in-akshay-kumars-show-1354549">Nia Sharma</a>, who will be playing Mischief Makers in the trending TV show.</p>

Following their wedding, the couple has been the center of chatter for many who have paid close attention to them, with recent rumors even suggesting that the two were expecting their first child. However, speaking with Times Now, the 28-year-old star shared that the guesses could not be far from the truth. She did share excitement for another announcement instead.</p>

<p><strong>Avika Gor sheds light on pregnancy rumors with her and Milind Chandwani&rsquo;s first baby</strong></p>

Kya hai jaldi batayenge... &quot; (There&rsquo;s some other update, we&rsquo;ll let you know soon).</p>

<p>The rumors of their possible pregnancy stemmed from the couple&rsquo;s recent update on their YouTube channel. The duo spoke about some sort of a &lsquo;new beginning,&rsquo; raising questions about whether they had already decided to announce an addition to their family. Avika Gor and Milind Chandwani&rsquo;s &lsquo;something big&rsquo; surprise has long been awaited, with many making assumptions, and while up until now they had stayed tight-lipped on the rumors, the couple seems ready to reveal it.&nbsp;</p>

Months leading up to the announcement of their separation, there was a lot of speculation regarding their relationship, where they stand as a couple, as well as their parenting of three children. Finally, on January 4, 2026, the two announced their plans to divorce and shared their commitment to raise their kids together. However, rumors of her having received 5 crore in alimony from her husband have spread online. Now the TV personality has responded to the rumors and denied earning the massive amount.</p>

<p><strong>Mahhi Vij firmly denies 5 crore alimony from Jay Bhanushali</strong></p>

<p>In her first vlog after announcing the couple&rsquo;s decision to divorce, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/mahhi-vij-reveals-getting-gifts-from-jay-bhanushali-amid-divorce-rumors-shares-details-about-his-japan-trip-1398254">Mahhi Vij</a> updated her YouTube channel with an 8 minute 33 second video titled &lsquo;Please stop it&rsquo; alongside a folded hands emoji. She addressed the speculations around their separation and clarified rumors surrounding the amount she allegedly received as alimony, &quot;Right now, I am seeing a lot of people on Instagram. Don&#39;t act with half-knowledge. I&#39;m reading things like &#39;Mahhi took 5 crore in alimony.&#39; People are pulling out old videos just for likes and comments. It&#39;s so sad.&quot;</p>

<p>She also confirmed their split, but confirmed their wish to raise their kids together, &ldquo;Yes, I am separated from Jay. We are divorced, but we remain good friends.&rdquo; Hinting at the moments leading up to their separation, she clarified that neither of them liked any drama, so they &lsquo;mutually decided that it&#39;s better for us to go our separate ways&rsquo; and decided to part without fights, arguments, or negativity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She emphasized that their bank accounts had not run out of money, and neither had her ex-husband run away, showing her dedication to continuing to be a family. They share three kids, Tara, Khushi, and Rajveer, the latter two of the which they adopted back in 2017 and welcomed their biological daughter in 2019.

However, it was unable to take over the classic fan favorite, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/kyunki-saas-bhi-kabhi-bahu-thi-2-disgusting-and-intolerable-say-netizens-as-they-slam-mihirs-drunk-scene-with-noina-1398488">Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2</a>.

Smriti Irani&rsquo;s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi 2 grabbed itself 2.2 in ratings this week, maintaining its top spot in the TRP report. The Star Plus family drama has persevered amid the release of multiple new shows, only occasionally bowing down to the likes of Bigg Boss 19, which enjoyed a successful run over its months of broadcast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the two strong contenders, Anupamaa, starring Rupali Ganguly, came in third, also showcasing its stronghold on the viewers.

From Mouni Roy in Season 1 to Tejasswi Prakash in Season 6, each actor has donned the avatar of the Naagin with utmost dedication, and each of them has maintained and added to the legacy of this beloved franchise. I&rsquo;ve taken inspiration from all the earlier Naagins, studying how they brought their own strengths and interpretations to the role. Of course, kudos to the OG Naagin, Mouni Roy, who set the benchmark and turned it into a true cultural phenomenon. My goal is to take the legacy of Naagin forward while paying homage to all the previous Naagins and adding my own twist to it&quot;, said Priyanka.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leading the supernatural charge are Priyanka Chahar Choudhary, Namik Paul, and Eisha Singh, who headline a stellar cast that includes Karan Kundrra, Alice Kaushik, and Beena Banerjee in key roles. Since its highly anticipated premiere on December 27, Naagin 7 has been bolstered by a strong ensemble featuring Nibedittaa Paal, Ashish Kaul, and Pyumori Mehta.</p>

Following her viral journey on the Indian reality TV show Bigg Boss 19, where many said that she made exaggerated statements about her lifestyle, upbringing, and wealth, she has been disproving them one by one, with the help of tours of her house and factory. In a recent appearance on the YouTube channel, News Pinch, she denied ever claiming that she had 150 bodyguards and asserted that she indeed has 150 staff members employed by her family.</p>

<p><strong>Tanya Mittal shuts down naysayers with clarification on having 150 staffers</strong></p>

<p>Speaking during a pharma factory tour with Abhinav Pandey, she was able to touch on the topic of false claims, saying that she has &lsquo;150 bodyguards&rsquo;. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/tanya-mittal-has-emotional-reunion-with-family-after-bigg-boss-19-says-kyuki-sab-mera-majak-udaate-1399149">Tanya Mittal</a> was very firm with her words and revealed how it was <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-promo-zeishan-qadri-calls-tanya-mittal-a-flipper-as-they-get-into-heated-argument-1396774">Zeishan Quadri</a>, a fellow contestant on the program, who changed her words, leading to fake narratives. Addressing the comments, she implored, &ldquo;I never said this. There is no clip where you can hear Tanya Mittal saying she has 150 bodyguards. These things were self-made. You won&rsquo;t find a single clip on the internet where I say I have 150 bodyguards.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Zeishan (Quadri) was joking about it. I had told him that I have over 150 staff members, and he turned it into bodyguards,&rdquo; Tanya revealed while speaking in the video. She clarified that while having a set of security personnel with her always, who she has previously referred to as her brothers and ones who she grew up with, they are not 150 or above in number. No exact number was mentioned by the influencer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She went on to add that her decision to have a house tour and a factory tour was to call out anyone who claimed that she was lying about the many businesses her family runs. At the same time, she was able to affirm that she never lied during her Bigg Boss 19 stint and thank her supporters for believing in her words.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, during another interview, Tanya Mittal debunked the rumors around her infamous &lsquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/fact-check-does-tanya-mittal-have-food-lift-at-home-new-update-reveals-truth-behind-boss-nickname-1399273">kitchen lift</a>&rsquo; that became the talk of the town on the show. Her family members were able to confirm that such a device indeed existed in their big house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the beauty pageant winner is all set to make her acting debut in an Ekta Kapoor project, which was offered to her by the director directly, when the latter made her appearance on the Salman Khan-hosted series.</p>

<p>Arjun Bijlani&rsquo;s father-in-law, Rakesh Chandra Swami, took his last breath on January 1, 2026. He suffered a brain stroke a couple of days back, after which, he was admitted to a Mumbai hospital. While recovering from the stroke and fighting for life, the 73-year-old breathed his last today, leaving family and close ones in tears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arjun, who was reportedly extremely close to his father-in-law, couldn&rsquo;t control his emotions at the cremation centre. He was captured hugging his young son in his vulnerable state. With tears in his eyes, the actor places his hand on his son&#39;s head to console him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Several celebs from the TV industry attended the funeral. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-video-nia-sharma-recalls-losing-her-father-at-the-age-of-14-reveals-she-did-odd-jobs-to-make-ends-meet-1353185">Nia Sharma</a>, who shares a great bond with Arjun Bijlani, also grieved the loss. She extended her support to the family during such a difficult time. In a video, the actress was seen hugging a family member of Arjun Bijlani. Chetna Panday and Kanika Mann were also spotted at the funeral site.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/arjun-bijlanis-father-in-law-rakesh-chandra-swami-passes-away-1399568">Rakesh Chandra Swami</a> is survived by his son, Nishank Swami, and a daughter, Neha, who is married to Arjun Bijlani. A close family member told Hindustan Times that he was doing well on December 29, 2025. He was about to have dinner when he suddenly suffered a stroke, after which the family rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where he was put on life support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arjun and Neha were on a Dubai vacation to celebrate the New Year; however, destiny had other plans. They have to return immediately after learning about their father&rsquo;s health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the work front, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/arjun-bijlani-on-how-he-avoided-falling-for-rs-1-48-crore-energy-drink-fraud-i-found-it-a-little-fishy-because-1378253">Arjun Bijlani</a> recently appeared in Rise and Fall.

When asked about the inevitable comparisons between her portrayal and Shubhangi Atre&rsquo;s, Shilpa reportedly remarked, &ldquo;Mujhe isme koi comparison nahi dikhti&rdquo; (I don&rsquo;t see any comparison here).</p>

<p>While Shilpa may have meant that she views her interpretation as unique, many&mdash;including her colleagues in the industry&mdash;heard something else: a lack of respect for the woman who had carried the show on her shoulders for the last nine years. This statement quickly became a topic of discussion on social media, with many stars expressing their disappointment.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="694fa366bff72"><strong>Falaq Naazz slams Shilpa Shinde</strong></h2>

<p>The backlash wasn&#39;t limited to fan comments. Prominent TV personalities have stepped forward to defend Shubhangi&rsquo;s dedication. Following actor Sourabh Raj Jain&rsquo;s disapproval, Bigg Boss OTT fame Falaq Naazz took to social media to voice her disappointment in a raw, direct post.</p>

<p>&quot;You left the show with a &lsquo;Tata, bye-bye,&rsquo;&quot; Falaq wrote, reminding Shilpa that the character didn&#39;t just survive in her absence&mdash;it thrived because of someone else&#39;s hard work. In a now-deleted Instagram story, Falaq suggested that instead of dismissiveness, the situation called for grace. She noted that if she were in Shilpa&#39;s shoes, she would have thanked the actress who kept the character relevant and &quot;returned it without any drama.&quot;</p>

<p>Falaq&rsquo;s final verdict was stinging: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not being overly confident&mdash;you&rsquo;re being rude. Very sad.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>Shilpa Shinde&rsquo;s return puts fans in dilemma</strong></h3>

<p>This controversy has put fans in a difficult position. On one hand, there is the undeniable nostalgia for Shilpa&rsquo;s original &quot;Angoori.&quot; On the other hand, there is a deep-seated respect for Shubhangi, who became the face of the show for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>By replacing the actress who stayed through thick and thin to accommodate the actress who once left, the makers have already sparked a debate on loyalty versus star power. Shilpa&rsquo;s recent comments have only added fuel to that fire, making her &quot;2.0&quot; journey one of the most scrutinized returns in Indian television history.</p>

<p>In the world of entertainment, characters might belong to the writers, but their hearts are built by the actors who play them. As this drama unfolds, it serves as a reminder that a little professional gratitude can go a long way&mdash;especially when you&#39;re stepping back into a house someone else kept warm for you.</p>

Now, the season&rsquo;s runner-up and actress, Farrhana Bhatt, has reacted to an incident from the show in which she shredded Neelam Giri&rsquo;s letter during a task.</p>

<p><strong>Farrhana Bhatt claims everyone was &lsquo;overacting&rsquo; when she shredded Neelam&rsquo;s letter</strong></p>

<p>Speaking with Farah Khan on the filmmaker&rsquo;s YouTube vlog, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-farrhana-bhatt-on-how-she-handled-her-emotions-after-losing-bigg-boss-19-to-gaurav-khanna-my-brain-was-completely-blank-1399057">Farrhana</a> was asked whether everyone was angry with her for shredding Neelam&rsquo;s letter. In response, the former Bigg Boss contestant said, &ldquo;I was calm. Sab log itna overacting kar rahe the, mujhe maza aa raha tha. Itna achha dikhne ke liye koi aisa kar sakta hai? Woh mujhe trigger nahi kar rahe the kyunki mujhe pata tha ki maine kuch galat nahi kiya.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Everyone else was overacting so much, and I was actually enjoying it. Why would they all do this just to look good on screen? I wasn&rsquo;t triggered because I knew I hadn&rsquo;t done anything wrong.)</p>

<p>For those unaware, during this season of Bigg Boss, contestants were given a chance to read letters from home. However, this depended on the decisions of their fellow housemates. If one contestant chose to shred another&rsquo;s letter, they would secure a place in the captaincy contention.</p>

<p>While most housemates sacrificed their captaincy chances and allowed others to read their letters, Farrhana decided otherwise and shredded <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-netizens-react-to-abhishek-bajaj-and-neelam-giris-eviction-real-threat-to-their-scripted-game-1398338">Neelam</a>&rsquo;s letter, leaving the latter in tears, despite other contestants pleading with Bhatt.</p>

<p>After the task concluded, the remaining contestants targeted Farrhana and lashed out at her for the move. She also faced criticism from viewers online.</p>

The theme of the season featured a parliament-style twist, where housemates formed a government, held assembly-style debates, and made key decisions.</p>

If someone chooses a certain path and their partner stands firmly by them, then there&rsquo;s really nothing more to be said&mdash;miya biwi raazi toh kya karega kaazi,&quot; he added.

And I feel when you look for reasons, then you are not ready.)</p>

<p>She went on to share that she thinks she cannot be that responsible, &ldquo;It is not so easy to have a child and raise it. It is a huge responsibility. I don&rsquo;t think I can do justice to the job or duty of raising a child. At this age or at any point.&rdquo; She was firm on not being affected by people who may think she&rsquo;s selfish for choosing her ambitions.</p>

During her appearance on Bigg Boss 19, the spiritual influencer made big, loud claims about her life back home in Gwalior, calling her home &lsquo;swarg&rsquo; (heaven) and boasting about the very technology and grandiose surroundings in which she lives. While viewers doubted her, it seems that she will be having the last laugh this time around, with many of her exaggerated statements being proven true. The latest one to join the ranks is the food lift that she spoke about.</p>

As per videos shared on her Instagram account, alongside reportage from The News Pinch, she could be seen opening up about the infamous lift. With a metal door covering it, her family introduces the door leading to the lift and how it actually does transfer their food around the lavish home. Her fans have offered support in the comments, sharing how happy they were that the rumors had been clarified and doubling down on the fact that she was not making up stories about her house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malti Chahar, a standout contestant from the recently concluded Bigg Boss 19, recently opened up about her harrowing encounters with the casting couch in the film industry. In a candid interview, the actress-filmmaker revealed two separate incidents: one where a South Indian director summoned her to a private room under the guise of a meeting, and another where a director attempted to kiss her without consent. Here is how she handled those situations and her message to others in the industry.</p>

<h3><strong>Malti Chahar recalls her horrifying&nbsp;casting couch experience</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-malti-chahar-reveals-if-she-dated-amaal-mallik-before-joining-bigg-boss-19-wo-darta-tha-1398959">Malti Chahar</a> entered the Bigg Boss 19 house mid-season as a wildcard contestant. The sister of popular Indian cricketer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-malti-chahar-meet-cricketer-deepak-chahars-sister-who-is-expected-to-make-wild-card-entry-in-bigg-boss-19-1397435">Deepak Chahar</a> gave a tough fight to many but got evicted before the finale. After exiting the house, she appeared in an interview with Siddharth Kannan. In the heart-to-heart conversation, she opened up about being part of the Indian film industry and experiencing the casting couch.</p>

<p>Malti recalled a troubling encounter following a script narration with a prominent South Indian producer and director. Shortly after the meeting, the director called her, requesting a second meeting in his hotel room. Sensing something was wrong, Malti ignored the invitation. However, the director persisted, calling her back to pressure her: &quot;Malti, samjha karo; industry mein aise nahi hota hai&quot; (Malti, try to understand; this isn&#39;t how things work in this industry).</p>

<p>Talking about another appalling incident, Chahar stated that a well-known director tried to kiss her when she gave him a casual hug as a polite gesture. &quot;Jab jaatein hai toh side se hug karte haina, toh maine side se hug kiya tha, and he tried to kiss me,&quot; she expressed, adding that she verbally gave him back. Since the person was very old, Malti said she made the mistake of considering him as a father figure. Malti thinks&nbsp;the incident helped her learn an important lesson: Not regard&nbsp;anyone as her father and stay away from them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the unknown, Malti made her acting debut with director Anil Sharma&#39;s film, Genius. She also directed a short film titled O Maaeri.</p>

She also opened up on how she felt when Salman Khan bashed her during Weekend Ka Vaar over her foul language and aggressive attitude.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Recalling the time when <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-salman-khan-in-advanced-talks-with-mahesh-narayanan-for-a-period-thriller-1395061">Salman Khan</a> brought a dictionary of her foul words and asked her to read every word out loud, Farrhana said, &ldquo;Pehle to mujhe samajh nahi aaya ki ye dictionary bani kyu? Lekin uss weekend thi meri galti. Main bahut gusse me thi aur kisi ko kuch bhi suna rahi thi. (At first, I didn&#39;t understand why this dictionary was created. But that weekend, it was my fault. I was very angry and could have said anything to anyone.) Unfortunately, he (Salman Khan) asked me to read the dictionary, and I literally read it. Main padh rahi hu aur mujhe hassi aa rahi h. (I am reading it and I am laughing.)&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-farrhana-bhatt-on-how-she-handled-her-emotions-after-losing-bigg-boss-19-to-gaurav-khanna-my-brain-was-completely-blank-1399057">Farrhana </a>admitted that she shouldn&#39;t have used that language while highlighting how she was the only one who got questioned for using those words. The Laila Majnu actress said, &ldquo;Mujhe laga tha ki zyada ho raha hai. Mujhe aisa nahi karna chahiye. Main bhool jaati hu, national television pe hu.. but ek waqt aaya literally ghar me&hellip;Jab koi ek word ghar ke 10 log bol rhe hai kabhi pick nahi kiya jata, but the moment Farrhana Bhatt uses it, ek aag lag jaati thi weekend pe. Dusri dictionary nikal gayi.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(I felt it was getting too much. I shouldn&#39;t do this. I forget I&#39;m on national television... But one point came when 10 people in the house are saying a word, it&#39;s never picked up, but the moment Farrhana Bhatt uses it, it would ignite a fire on the weekend. Another dictionary came out.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, Farrhana Bhatt revealed the incident when she felt like leaving the show after getting bashed by the host. Bhatt said, &ldquo;It was the 11th week when I was so happy and was telling everyone ki aaj mujhe kuch nahi sunna padega. Aur dusri dictionary ussi weekend nikli. And I was so traumatized that day. I felt like, damn, ek point pe aapko lagta hai ki bas nahi karna hai mujhe. I want to leave this house. That was the moment. Bahut zyada ho gaya tha mere liye (It was too much for me).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Compiling everything I was sure that I am the winner of this season. But at some point, I had this thing in my mind that if I&#39;ll lose, I have to take it gracefully. Otherwise, handling it there on the stage is very difficult. You have to hold yourself back from breaking down,&rdquo; said Farrhana.&nbsp;</p>

Wo toh Shehbaz ne bola toh mujhe realize hua ki Amaal aisa kar raha hai, aur jab maine usse jake pucha toh uski body language se mujhe laga ki ye aisa kar raha hai toh mujhe ghussa aagaya tu aisa kyu kar raha hai.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(My statement was not to hint at something. I never even knew Amaal was doing something of the sort or saying such things [about me]. When Shehbaz came around, I realized Amaal was doing so, and by observing his body language, I understood [he was trying to deny ever knowing me]. So I got angry about why he was doing so.)</p>

<p><strong>Malti Chahar demands that Amaal Mallik reveal the truth himself</strong></p>

<p>She wanted them to be upfront about having known each other in the past, further saying, &ldquo;Agar tu jaanta hai toh tu bol na jaanta hai. Aisa kuch hai bhi nahi ki aap hide karo. Par usko kuch toh tha, wo darta tha, ye sahi sawal uske liye hai, mere liye galat sawal hai kyuki mai nahi darti thi. Ab wo kyu dar raha hai usko pata hoga. Aap usse puchiye. Mai toh bohot confident thi toh mai galat insan hu ye sawal puchne ke liye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(If you know me, then tell everyone that you do. There&rsquo;s nothing for you to hide. But there was something, he was afraid of. So this is a question for him. It&rsquo;s not for me because I was never afraid. As for why he was scared, that&rsquo;s something for you to ask him. I was very confident, and so I&rsquo;m not the one who should be asked this.)</p>

With the competition intensifying, several entertaining moments unfolded in the house, including Khan schooling the housemates within the first few minutes of the episode.</p>

<p>Moreover, the actor paid tribute to veteran star Dharmendra, who passed away earlier this week.</p>

<p><strong>Ashnoor Kaur gets evicted from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-november-27-episode-written-update-gaurav-khanna-wins-ticket-to-finale-tanya-breaks-down-after-ashnoor-task-fight-1398761">Bigg Boss 19</a></strong></p>

<p>The recent Weekend Ka Vaar episode brought a major shift in dynamics as contestant Ashnoor Kaur was evicted from the show. The daily soap actress had recently physically harmed co-star Tanya Mittal during a task, which Salman confronted her about.</p>

<p>After showing the clip, the Bollywood superstar stated that Kaur had intentionally hurt Tanya. Highlighting that such behaviour isn&#39;t acceptable on the show, he questioned why Ashnoor&#39;s anger had escalated significantly after her father&#39;s visit to the house.</p>

<p>Salman pointed out that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-promo-salman-khan-slams-tanya-mittal-and-neelam-giri-for-body-shaming-ashnoor-kaur-1398137">Ashnoor</a> had stayed in the house only because Pranit More saved her during the task by choosing her over Abhishek Bajaj. Despite the actress&#39;&nbsp;attempts to explain herself, the Bajrangi Bhaijaan star refused to accept her justification and announced her eviction due to violent behaviour. He emphasized that Ashnoor only acknowledged her mistake after he pointed it out to her.</p>

<p><strong>Ashnoor wishes Pranit or Gaurav could win the show</strong></p>

<p>After her eviction, Ashnoor expressed that she wants to see her friends, either Gaurav Khanna or Pranit More, win the show. Meanwhile, Malti Chahar commented that Ashnoor tends to cry only when situations don&#39;t go in her favour.</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan praises Gaurav Khanna</strong></p>

<p>Salman praised <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-gaurav-khanna-gets-a-reality-check-as-wife-akanksha-chamola-advises-him-to-distance-himself-from-farrhana-bhatt-1398549">Gaurav Khanna</a>&#39;s stance, saying he always shares his opinions honestly with the audience and offers unbiased views. The host also noted that Farrhana Bhatt is supporting Gaurav in the Ticket to Finale task and asked her why. She revealed that she did not want Ashnoor to win.</p>

<p>The Bollywood superstar further explained that Gaurav wanted Farrhana to win the task because, if she were selected for the competition, Amaal would likely defeat her in the challenge.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the episode, Khanna became emotional after receiving praise from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-salman-khan-allots-2-days-for-his-cameo-in-riteish-deshmukh-directed-raja-shivaji-1398286">Salman Khan</a>. Shehbaz even went ahead and congratulated the CID actor on receiving the compliment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tanya said she felt bad about Ashnoor&#39;s eviction during a conversation with the soap opera actor. She added that she had hoped Ashnoor would apologise, and noted that Ashnoor became provoked after a remark implying she existed in the shadow of the Anupamaa star.</p>

Malti tells Shehbaz that she saw three tissue papers that were thrown in the washroom before Farrhana went in. After Farrhana used it, there were four. However, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-exclusive-abhishek-bajaj-reveals-truth-behind-relationship-with-ashnoor-kaur-were-emotionally-connected-1398362">Ashnoor Kaur</a> says that there were four already. Malti accuses Farrhana of poor hygiene and they eventually engage in a nasty fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Farrhana loses her cool, she refers to Malti as &lsquo;psychic.&rsquo; The Laila Majnu actress calls out Malti for the cheap tactics she has been using to mess with her. Chahar fires back and asks Farrhana to wash her hands before chopping vegetables and even questions her verbal hygiene. In response, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-tanya-and-farrhana-get-into-verbal-fight-again-during-family-week-is-their-friendship-over-1398586">Farrhana </a>tells a &lsquo;shayari&rsquo; about people trying to drag her down.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Amaal goes to Pranit and confronts him about publicly calling him a sore loser during Weekend Ka Vaar. The stand-up comedian explains not considering Amaal his friend but says that there would always be mutual self-respect.</p>

<p>Further, Bigg Boss introduces the nomination task. The master of the house explains housemates will stamp &#39;nominated&#39; on each other&#39;s faces and the one with no stamp will remain safe, otherwise they will end up getting nominated. Pranit nominates Amaal and says that the music composer can&#39;t control his aggression. He also nominates Farrhana, Tanya, and Shehbaz.</p>

<p>As the task proceeds, Tanya says she wants to nominate everyone except her. After the housemates are done voting, they put stamps on those whom they nominated. Later, Tanya presses the &#39;nominated&#39; stamp directly onto Malti&#39;s lips. This particular action prompts <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-november-23-episode-highlights-salman-khan-announces-kunickaa-sadanands-eviction-malti-chahar-confronts-pranit-more-1398671?amp">Malti </a>to slap Tanya though her hand only lightly brushes Tanya&rsquo;s face. Tanya insists she meant it in a light-hearted way, but the others criticize her for lacking etiquettes. Lastly, Bigg Boss announces that the entire house is nominated for this week.</p>

<p>In the latest episode, the Sultan actor took it upon himself to call out <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-november-20-episode-written-update-armaan-malik-warns-amaal-mallik-about-tanya-mittal-as-prayag-more-roasts-housemates-1398608">Amaal Mallik</a> and Shehbaz Badesha for their behavior and remarks on the show. Additionally, he used the opportunity to school Kunickaa Sadanand.</p>

<p><strong>Bigg Boss 19, November 22, Weekend Ka Vaar Highlights</strong></p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan confronts Kunickaa Sadanand over remarks made about Malti</strong></p>

<p>The latest episode took an interesting and dramatic turn when <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-weekend-ka-vaar-promo-salman-khan-calls-out-kunickaas-comments-on-malti-threatens-to-kick-out-amaal-mallik-1398642">Salman</a> openly criticized Kunickaa for levying insensitive comments at Malti Chahar. The actor reminded her that such comments are unacceptable on a public platform and emphasized how insensitive the remark was.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/mere-aur-mere-bete-ke-beech-ka-age-gap-hai-kunickaa-sadanand-reveals-early-marriage-at-16-talks-about-ashnoor-abhisheks-age-difference-1398235">Kunickaa</a> immediately apologized to Malti and clarified that she is not homophobic, adding that she respects every individual&#39;s personal choices.</p>

<p><strong>Salman slams Amaal Mallik for avoiding direct conflict</strong></p>

<p>During the episode, the Ek Tha Tiger actor confronted Amaal Mallik for always being defensive and avoiding direct confrontation. He pointed out that the musician often talks about others behind their backs and does not address issues face-to-face, citing his comments about Gaurav Khanna as an example.</p>

<p>Salman also reprimanded Amaal for misbehaving with Rohit Shetty, stating that he only picks fights with people he knows will not retaliate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, both Mallik and Pranit More were called out by Khan for repeatedly being rude to Malti.</p>

<p><strong>Salman reprimands Shehbaz Badeshah for using Amaal as a shield</strong></p>

<p>Salman then addressed <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/who-is-bigg-boss-19-contestant-shehbaz-badeshas-girlfriend-kashish-aggarwal-all-about-the-beauty-influencer-1398249">Shehbaz Badesha</a>&#39;s behavior, accusing him of constantly using Amaal as a shield and acting like merely a &quot;sidekick&quot; to the musician inside the house.</p>

<p>He pointed out that Shehbaz&#39;s habit of invoking Amaal&#39;s name in every situation appears clingy and directionless. Salman even added that if he were Bigg Boss, he would have opened the doors for Shehbaz and asked him to leave the game by now.</p>

<p><strong>Salman also comments on Ashnoor&rsquo;s change in behaviour</strong></p>

<p>Finally, Salman also addressed the noticeable change in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-exclusive-abhishek-bajaj-reveals-truth-behind-relationship-with-ashnoor-kaur-were-emotionally-connected-1398362">Ashnoor Kaur</a>&#39;s behaviour after she met her father inside the Bigg Boss house. He asked her, &ldquo;Itne hafte kyun lage aapko reaction dene mein?&rdquo; (Why did it take you so many weeks to give a reaction?).</p>

She alleged that she was mentally harassed by the producer. Later, the actress talked about the same in an interview with Pinkvilla and highlighted that she was denied a sabbatical despite citing medical reasons. In a recent development, it seems that Asit Modi has resolved the long-standing feud with the actress. </p>

<p>In a recent statement released by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/exclusive-taarak-mehta-ka-ooltah-chashmahs-palak-sindhwani-recalls-suffering-panic-attack-amid-ongoing-feud-reveals-asit-kumar-modi-threatened-her-1350901">Asit Modi</a>'s production house, the banner clarified that all matters with Palak Sidhwani are resolved now. “Neela Film Productions would like to share that all matters between the company and Palak Sindhwani have been amicably resolved.

We also believe in fostering a fair, transparent, and supportive work environment, ensuring that every artiste and team member feels respected and valued.”</p>

She highlighted that the production team rejected her request. "I have had certain medical issues. I don't want to go into details of that. My doctor advised me to take less stress and asked me to maintain a good lifestyle where I get good sleep and the work is light. But here anything happens at any time. I was planning to quit the show. In December 2023, for the first time, I told their production head that I want to quit. After hearing this, he said, 'No, not now. Now another co-actor is leaving," said Palak. </p>

Now, it seems the couple is all set to enter wedlock soon and is apparently planning to have it in 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Tejasswi Prakash and Karan Kundrra to marry in 2026?</strong></p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bharti-singh-flaunts-baby-bump-in-pregnancy-announcement-pic-with-haarsh-limbachiyaa-parineeti-chopra-comments-1397473">Bharti Singh</a> and Haarsh Limbachiyaa&#39;s podcast, the actress said, &ldquo;Haan, aise bol toh rahe hain. Haan matlab aisi baatein toh hum kar rahe hain, but then let&#39;s see.&rdquo; (Yes, that&#39;s what is being said. I mean, we are talking about such things, but then, let&#39;s see.)</p>

<p>Interestingly, in the same podcast interview, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/tejasswi-prakash-recalls-being-treated-differently-in-initial-phase-of-her-career-senior-actors-were-given-1376581">Tejasswi Prakash</a> revealed that Karan Kundrra had initially proposed to her just after Bigg Boss 15 ended. However, her mother advised both of them to take some time before making such a decision and to date for a while first.</p>

<p>The actress added, &ldquo;Mere parents ko bhi accha laga tha <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/karan-kundrra-slams-paid-trolls-for-spreading-breakup-rumors-with-tejasswi-prakash-says-it-annoys-me-1394536">Karan</a> (My parents also liked him). He was like, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s get married, but my mother said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve just come out of Bigg Boss. Maybe you should spend a year together in the real world. It&#39;s not that I doubt you (Karan), but I don&#39;t even know my daughter. I feel both of you need some time.&rsquo; I am very chanchal (impatient/bubbly). If I fall in love, I&#39;m like, &lsquo;This is the one.&rsquo; So my mother said, &lsquo;Take your time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tejasswi spoke about her bond with Karan&#39;s parents, revealing that his family is genuinely wonderful and very sweet. She added that from the beginning, she and Karan were very clear about one thing, and it was that there would be no pressure for their families to approve of them. The actress explained that it was never about &quot;Your parents have to like me&quot; or &quot;You have to win over my parents.&quot;</p>

<p>The former Bigg Boss contestant&nbsp;expressed that she strongly believes turning a relationship into a compulsion creates unnecessary pressure, and then the bond stops growing naturally. From day one, she felt no need to impress anyone, which allowed her to just be herself. She mentioned that when she told them she naturally wakes up late, doesn&#39;t know how to cook, and can&#39;t even make tea, they actually appreciated her honesty.</p>

However, to his surprise and disappointment, the entire speech never made it to the final telecast. He recounts how heartfelt and vulnerable the moment was, expressing personal truths and clearing the air about specific conflicts. Mridul thinks the edited part from the episode felt like a deliberate choice that deprived viewers of an important piece of his journey. It made him feel unheard and misrepresented, reinforcing his belief that the makers selectively showcase only what supports the storyline they want to highlight.</p>

Ahead of this week&#39;s eviction, the Bollywood superstar slammed Farrhana Bhatt for her derogatory remarks about the TV industry and criticized her attitude. Moreover, the actor also called out other contestants, labeling them all as &quot;predictable.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Bigg Boss 19: Weekend Ka Vaar Highlights</strong></p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan exposes Neelam Giri&rsquo;s hypocrisy</strong></p>

<p>At the beginning of the latest Weekend Ka Vaar episode, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khan-on-shah-rukh-khans-success-and-him-being-an-outsider-aamir-khan-and-i-come-from-1397793">Salman Khan</a> gave Neelam Giri a strong reprimand, saying that she had become an expert at gossiping inside the house.</p>

<p>Salman said, &ldquo;When you were left alone, what did you do? You became Neelam the Khabri (Informer). You&#39;ve spent eleven weeks in the house without any real issues. You haven&#39;t taken anyone&#39;s side openly. The other housemates are wondering - what exactly is your modus operandi?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added, &ldquo;Malti had shared something about Amaal Mallik, and Neelam spiced it up before passing it on, which unnecessarily caused an argument between Amaal and Malti Chahar. However, both of them managed to sort it out quite easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Sultan actor highlighted how Neelam was upset when Amaal made inappropriate comments about Tanya Mittal, yet she often did the same to others, calling out her hypocrisy.</p>

<p>The actor questioned, &ldquo;Neelam, we&#39;d like to know where all these strong emotions of yours were when you were speaking ill of Tanya, not just with Kunika, but with others around the house as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you doing while sitting and talking with Farrhana Bhatt? I just want to say, Neelam, you seem to be playing a double game. Your own game hasn&#39;t come out clearly. And if this is your game, then well, what can I say?&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Gaurav Khanna, Mridul Tiwari, and Amaal Mallik agreed with Salman&#39;s remarks, calling out <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-weekend-ka-vaar-promo-salman-khan-slams-neelam-giris-doglapan-11-hafte-nikale-bina-kisi-individuality-1398310">Neelam</a>&#39;s&nbsp;inconsistent stance toward Tanya.</p>

<p><strong>Salman schools Tanya for body-shaming Ashnoor Kaur</strong></p>

<p>Salman then turned to Tanya and said, &ldquo;As you sow, so shall you reap - this fits you perfectly. When Neelam was body-shaming Ashnoor Kaur, you didn&#39;t stop her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Khanna chimed in, adding, &ldquo;Tanya has been using Neelam from the start. No fight in the house happens without her adding fuel to the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Bajrangi Bhaijaan star further said, &ldquo;You haven&#39;t apologized to Ashnoor. When I tell you to, you should express regret instead of blaming Neelam.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Salman reprimands Farrhana Bhatt</strong></p>

<p>During the episode, Salman also schooled Mridul, who had threatened to hit <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-promo-mridul-tiwari-mocks-farrhana-kunickaa-schools-ashnoor-for-spending-time-only-with-abhishek-bajaj-1398224">Farrhana</a> during a task. Later, he criticized Farrhana for her inappropriate language and arrogant attitude.</p>

<p>Since Farrhana had disrespected the television industry, Salman asked her to step out of the show if that was how she felt about it.</p>

<p>Towards the end, Salman praised Gaurav, calling him a superstar who has been consistently working in television for the past 20 years. He also mentioned that his mother watches Anupamaa, expressing admiration for the actor&#39;s long-standing career.</p>

A ringing sound leaves Neelam excited as she expects Bigg Boss might have sent ration. She enters the storeroom and notices movement inside one of the cabinets. Shocked, she calls out, &ldquo;Kaun hai? Kaun hai usme?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other contestants rush to investigate. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/celebrity-masterchef-winner-gaurav-khanna-breaks-silence-on-controversy-over-copying-swiss-chefs-dessert-exclusive-video-1383392">Gaurav Khanna</a> says that the person in the store room could be Pranit More. Tension and chaos fill the room until Mridul Tiwari and Ashnoor Kaur open the cabinet. Immediately, they scream in happiness after discovering Pranit hiding inside and realising his re-entry into the Bigg Boss 19 house. Everyone celebrates his arrival except for Farrhana Bhatt and Tanya Mittal.</p>

<p>Later, Amaal and Farrhana argue over who will clean the dishes. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/serial-updates/bigg-boss-19-september-22-episode-written-update-kunickaa-sadanand-and-zeishan-quadris-fight-turns-ugly-nomination-task-begins-1397109">Kunickaa</a> asks Farrhana to put the plate she left on the table into the sink after dinner. The veteran actress also confronts Farrhana for making an issue out of everything, and that too unnecessarily. During the argument, Amaal announces that if Farrhana does not come to the kitchen to do the dishes within 20&ndash;30 minutes, she will have to prepare her own food.</p>

<p>The next day, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-promo-mridul-tiwari-mocks-farrhana-kunickaa-schools-ashnoor-for-spending-time-only-with-abhishek-bajaj-1398224">Farrhana </a>and Kunickaa again fight over food and duties. As they engage in a heated exchange, the former calls the latter &lsquo;gandi aurat.&rsquo; In order to help Farrhana, Tanya steps in to do her part of the duty. On the other hand, Gaurav Khanna talks to Mridul Tiwari about Tanya and Farrhana becoming the new best friend duo in the house. He goes on to claim that the social media influencer no longer needs Neelam by her side.</p>

<p>Further, Tanya fights with Amaal, calling out his attitude towards her. Lastly, Pranit entertains everyone with his stand-up comedy by taking a sarcastic dig at the housemates.</p>

<p>The episode ends.</p>

<p>The Bigg Boss 16 contestant went on to reveal that he is getting several offers, which include some exciting work in South India as well. &ldquo;Because I have already done TV and reality shows, I want to step out and see what other things I can do.

Ashnoor Kaur mimics Tanya Mittal, leaving other contestants in splits. Later, Shehbaz Badesha finds yogurt and jaggery hidden in his tub. Bigg Boss announces a task for the contestants to earn captaincy contendership. The contestants groove on the musical guitar dance floor in a bid to secure the captaincy role.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-shehbaz-badesha-meet-bigg-boss-13-fame-shehnaaz-gills-brother-whos-a-probable-contestant-of-bigg-boss-19-1395925">Shehbaz</a> and Tanya get eliminated in the first round. After the task resumes, Farrhana and Mridul are seen getting into a fight about pushing each other to remain on the guitar floor. They engage in an ugly spat with Farrhana, saying, &ldquo;Bheekh maang ke yahan aaya hai.&rdquo; When Gaurav Khanna backs Mridul, the Laila Majnu actress says, &ldquo;GK ka standard bhi girr gaya hai, isliye aisa bol raha hai ke accha bol raha hai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the fight snowballs into a huge argument, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-promo-mridul-tiwari-mocks-farrhana-kunickaa-schools-ashnoor-for-spending-time-only-with-abhishek-bajaj-1398224">Farrhana </a>turns extremely furious and asks Gaurav, &ldquo;Kaun ho aap? TV ke superstar ho koi? Dekha nahi hai kabhi aapko.&rdquo; Ultimately, Farrhana and Mridul get eliminated from the task. The next round witnesses Kunickaa Sadanand and Neelam Giri pushing Abhishek Bajaj from the task stage, leaving him visibly enraged.</p>

<p>After getting out of the race, the Anupamaa actor tells Farrhana, &ldquo;Power of television dikhaunga. GK dikhayega GK kaun hai. Haan hoon main TV ka superstar, yahan ka, finale mein khade hoke taali bajayegi mere liye dekhna. Tu jaani jaayegi ke tu mere season mein aayi thi.&rdquo;</p>

Further, Abhishek turns so enraged that he warns Kunickaa not to get involved in a physical altercation with him ever. Later in the day, Amaal and Tanya discuss the recent developments about them.</p>

<p>In one of the segments, Tanya lashes out at Shehbaz for claiming that she talked about whom Amaal would kiss if he wins the show. She warns him not to go below the belt by making a false accusation against her. In the bathroom area, Abhishek explains that Tanya would often call him &lsquo;handsome&rsquo; when alone, but tries to insult him in front of other contestants.</p>

<h3><strong>Kunickaa Sadanand gives up kitchen duties and locks horns with Abhishek Bajaj</strong></h3>

<p>In the kitchen, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-new-promo-mridul-tiwari-gives-it-back-to-kunickaa-sadanand-for-nominating-him-fans-cant-keep-calm-1396356">Mridul Tiwari</a> takes the responsibility of kneading the dough for rotis.

Abhishek Bajaj, on the other hand, points out that Baseer Ali shouldn&#39;t have started a love angle with Nehal Chudasama as it didn&#39;t feel organic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Tanya Mittal and Ashnoor Kaur clash over former&rsquo;s joke on Abhishek&rsquo;s personal life</strong></h3>

<p>In the garden area, Tanya Mittal and Farrhana Bhatt talk about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/who-is-abhishek-bajajs-ex-wife-everything-to-know-about-akanksha-jindal-1397978">Abhishek Bajaj</a>&rsquo;s ex-wife in front of him. They continue to tease him, leaving the actor uncomfortable. Tanya, Farrhana, and Abhishek Bajaj are seen having a conversation where Tanya asks Abhishek if he is married. Bajaj clarifies, saying that there&#39;s nothing. Getting awkward, Abhishek leaves the garden area and then goes to Ashnoor Kaur and tells her everything.</p>

<p>Furious about the same, the Patiala Babes actress confronts Tanya and asks her not to drag Abhishek&rsquo;s personal life. Ashnoor also questions Tanya&#39;s character, to which the latter responds in anger.</p>

<p>Later, Kunickaa Sadanand breaks down, remembering <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-double-eviction-baseer-ali-and-nehal-chudasama-get-eliminated-from-salman-khan-hosted-show-1397991">Baseer </a>and Nehal&rsquo;s eviction. Farrhana and Pranit lock horns after the former points out one of the statements he made during a task. As the episode proceeds, we see Tanya and Neelam talking to each other. It appears that the duo has reconciled.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Bigg Boss nominates Abhishek Bajaj and Ashnoor Kaur&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>In the assembly room, Bigg Boss shows footage of Abhishek and Ashnoor talking without a mic, and that too, repeatedly. As per the clip, they continue to break the rule despite numerous reminders. Bigg Boss schools them, sending the duo out of the assembly room. The master of the house mentions that only Ashnoor and Abhishek should be nominated for this week as punishment.</p>

<p>However, Bigg Boss asks them to share their opinions and make the decision. While most of the contestants agree, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/celebrity-masterchef-winner-gaurav-khanna-breaks-silence-on-controversy-over-copying-swiss-chefs-dessert-exclusive-video-1383392">Gaurav Khanna</a>, Farrhana Bhatt, and Malti Chahar disagree. They argue that only Ashnoor and Abhishek shouldn&#39;t be nominated and must be given a chance to rectify their mistake. Lastly, Mridul (being the captain) says &lsquo;no&rsquo; to Bigg Boss&rsquo;s punishment. As a result, the entire house gets nominated except for Abhishek and Ashnoor.</p>

<p>Following the nomination announcement, Gaurav and Kunickaa engage in an ugly spat. The Anupamaa actor continues to defend both, while others question him. Lastly, Bigg Boss announces that 50% portion of the weekly ration will also be cut. The entire house turns chaotic, and major drama unfolds.</p>

As Salman Khan returns for yet another Weekend Ka Vaar episode, here&#39;s a look at some of the most interesting moments.</p>

<p><strong>Bigg Boss 19, October 25 highlights</strong></p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan questions house dynamics; lashes out at Nehal Chudasama and Neelam Giri</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/are-shah-rukh-khan-and-salman-khan-making-cameos-as-pathaan-and-tiger-in-alia-bhatt-sharvaris-alpha-1397973">Salman Khan</a> asked Tanya Mittal about her equation with Farhana Bhatt and Neelam Giri. Tanya explained that she had given the &quot;best friend&quot; tag to Neelam. She also confessed that the entire house had turned against her after she started talking to Farhana.</p>

<p>The Ek Tha Tiger actor later lashed out at Neelam and Nehal for their actions, which led to several controversial moments in the house.</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan extends support to Tanya Mittal</strong></p>

<p>Salman questioned Nehal and Baseer for interrogating <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-weekend-ka-vaar-promo-salman-khan-backs-tanya-mittal-farrhana-bhatts-new-bond-hints-at-double-eviction-1397961">Tanya</a> about her bond with Farhana. Baseer claimed that the social media influencer conveniently switched sides and people, a statement supported by Amaal Mallik.</p>

<p>The Bajrangi Bhaijaan star&nbsp;then gave Neelam a reality check, stating that she was the one who had started the issue, ultimately siding with Tanya in the rift that had developed in their friendship.</p>

<p><strong>Salman slams Malti Chahar; teases a wild card entry to expose her</strong></p>

<p>Salman Khan questioned Malti Chahar about her game strategy. He advised her to be prepared for the reactions of those she chose to attack. During the discussion, Salman revealed that a wildcard contestant would soon enter the house. He even warned Malti that the new entrant could potentially expose her.</p>

<p><strong>Salman criticizes Shehbaz&rsquo;s motives for making Mridul the captain</strong></p>

<p>Khan questioned Shehbaz&#39;s motives behind making Mridul the captain. He asked whether there had ever been a day or week when he had said that Mridul was the best player in the house.</p>

<p>Addressing everyone, he further questioned why they believed Mridul was deserving of the captaincy, pointing out that he didn&#39;t seem fit for the role.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-shehbaz-badesha-meet-bigg-boss-13-fame-shehnaaz-gills-brother-whos-a-probable-contestant-of-bigg-boss-19-1395925">Shehbaz</a>&nbsp;tried to defend himself, explaining that they had wanted Mridul to step up and be given a chance to show his game. However, not convinced, Salman pressed further, asking if they had chosen a captain who would simply listen to them.</p>

Among them, Mridul Tiwari and Pranit More received the most votes, with the former being elected as captain for the week.</p>

<p><strong>Tanya and Neelam&rsquo;s bitterness continues</strong></p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-october-23-episode-highlights-neelam-giri-and-tanya-mittals-friendship-hit-rock-bottom-latter-lashes-out-at-nehal-chudasama-1397934">Tanya Mittal</a> and Neelam Giri&#39;s friendship hit rock bottom as their bitterness continued even at the dining table. When Tanya refused to have dinner, Neelam asked Farrhana Bhatt to serve her food.</p>

<p>While Farrhana declined, Malti agreed to feed Tanya. However, the influencer refused to eat the food served by her. Neelam then offered her halwa made by Kunickaa Sadanand, but Tanya set the bowl aside.</p>

<p>Later, Tanya became emotional and broke down as Shehbaz and Farrhana tried to console her. The next morning, she was seen talking to a prop, saying she didn&#39;t have any friends inside the house. She also refused to mend her relationship with Neelam, citing her attitude as the reason.</p>

<p><strong>Abhishek persuades Mridul to assign kitchen duties to Gaurav</strong></p>

<p>While dividing household duties for the week, Mridul was persuaded by Abhishek Bajaj to assign Gaurav Khanna the kitchen duties. Although the Anupamaa actor protested furiously, saying he couldn&#39;t cook, he was eventually assigned the responsibility.</p>

<p>As Neelam was appointed to assist him, Mridul warned Abhishek not to cross the line. Later, Pranit spoke with the Babli Bouncer actor, who argued that Gaurav hadn&#39;t contributed much to the house. Pranit countered, pointing out the actor&#39;s involvement in tasks. The two later hugged, resolving their disagreement.</p>

<p><strong>Farrhana slams Neelam and Malti, limits conversations with Tanya</strong></p>

<p>Following a task, Farrhana lashed out at <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-new-promo-neelam-giri-ends-friendship-with-tanya-housemates-turn-against-her-1397910">Neelam</a> for her attitude. When Malti came to Neelam&#39;s defense, the Notebook actress called her a &quot;ghatiya aurat&quot; (cheap woman).</p>

<p>In the garden area, Tanya confronted the Bhojpuri actress about her hypocrisy. Neelam, however, explained that she was possessive about her relationships and expected those who loved her to understand the same.</p>

<p>Later, the social media influencer told Farrhana that Neelam was possessive of her and that their friendship might hurt Neelam&#39;s feelings. The two decided to limit their conversations to protect the friendship, while Kunickaa tried to mediate.</p>

<p><strong>Amaal Mallik taunts Tanya, says &lsquo;kone mein rone wale log&rsquo;</strong></p>

<p>Later, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-october-18-episode-highlights-amaal-malliks-father-daboo-schools-him-salman-khan-gives-last-warning-to-abhishek-bajaj-1397814">Amaal Mallik</a> got into an exchange of fiery words with Mittal. Frustrated by her emotional outbursts, he called her &ldquo;kone mein rone wale log&rdquo; (people who cry in corners), claiming she was trying to draw attention and sympathy ahead of Weekend Ka Vaar.</p>

<p>After she walked away, the musician advised Neelam to stop chasing her and not make a fool of herself on a public platform. The episode ended with Tanya attempting to speak with Neelam, but the latter clearly refused to engage.</p>

He explained that he had been very nervous at that moment and that his attitude had come across completely wrong, although it had never been his intention to be rude.</p>

<p>Ishit added that he holds great respect for Amitabh Bachchan and the entire KBC team. He mentioned that he had learned an important lesson about how words and actions reflect a person&#39;s character, especially on such a prominent platform, and promised to be more humble, respectful, and thoughtful in the future.</p>

Being friends with each other is very important. Of course, there will be problems, but you have to go into the friendship mode and talk it out. There&#39;s give and take as friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Taking the conversation ahead, Parmeet Sethi recalled marrying Archana in 1992. &quot;It was much before DDLJ (Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge). We did not announce it to the world because that was the time when the actresses were offered no work if they got married. It was not like today, as you see, Kajol, Deepika, and Alia are working today. So we did not announce it. When Archana was pregnant with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/archana-puran-singhs-son-aaryamann-sethi-engaged-to-longtime-girlfriend-yogita-bihani-gifts-her-birthday-present-worth-over-rs-2-lakh-1395624">Aaryamann</a>, we announced our marriage. Of course, the industry people knew, but officially, we did not tell anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Archana Puran Singh and Parmeet Sethi have been together for more than 30 years. In one of their vlogs, the veteran actress reassured fans that their relationship is strong and full of love.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the dining table, Baseer explains how he wants his relationship to be with Nehal. On the other hand, Farrhana tells Gaurav, Abhishek, Pranit, and Ashnoor that she doesn&#39;t need a &#39;love angle&#39; to be seen. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/laila-majnu-re-release-box-office-collections-triptii-dimri-and-avinash-tiwary-film-has-a-verdict-changing-re-run-crosses-rs-10-crore-net-overall-1346660">Laila Majnu </a>actress goes on to add that she feels that Baseer is faking it.</p>

He goes on to talk with Nehal Chudasama about not calling out Shehbaz Badesha for irritating Malti Chahar during the ration task. Later, the Dabangg actor questions Malti for her &lsquo;kapde pehen ke aa&rsquo; remark on Nehal. Salman also talks to Farrhana about calling Neelam &lsquo;Bhojpuri staff.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the episode proceeds, the host advises everyone not to target each other on the basis of languages, region, or community.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Salman Khan addresses Amaal Mallik and Abhishek Bajaj&#39;s ugly fight</strong></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/salman-khan-slams-ar-murugadoss-if-sikandar-failed-because-of-my-ethics-what-about-madharaasi-1397657">Sikandar </a>actor discusses Amaal Mallik&rsquo;s action during the nomination task that instigated Abhishek Bajaj. Salman Khan firmly says that the music composer intentionally tried to provoke Bajaj and initiate a fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bhaijaan calls Shehbaz Badesha &lsquo;irritating&rsquo; and emphasizes that he anyhow tries to be seen on camera, no matter whatever the issue is. Salman schools him for finding humor in serious situations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Salman subtly moves on to talk about Farrhana&rsquo;s decision to shred Neelam&rsquo;s family letter. He calls out <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-october-16-episode-highlights-amaal-mallik-snatches-farrhana-bhatts-food-plate-vicious-verbal-brawl-erupts-1397769">Amaal </a>for snatching Farrhana&#39;s plate. For the unversed, the music composer not only abused her but also snatched her food plate while she was having lunch.</p>

<p>As Salman backs Farrhana, he bashes Amaal for passing a derogatory remark about her mother. Giving an explanation, Amaal says that he can&#39;t tolerate her and her words. The 35-year-old goes on to add that she has also said many insulting comments about his parents also.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Daboo Malik joins Salman Khan on Bigg Boss 19 stage</strong></h3>

<p>Amaal Mallik&rsquo;s dad, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/daboo-malik-says-anu-malik-and-armaan-maliks-fame-overshadowed-son-amaal-maliks-hard-work-not-having-an-identity-1396198">Daboo Malik</a>, arrives on the stage and urges him to have control over his tongue. Daboo tells Amaal, &ldquo;Main ye kehne aaya hoon ki tu lad-jhagad lekin apni zubaan ko under the belt mat jaane de beta. Tujhe jeet ke aana hai. Mere maathe pe mat likh de ki tu iss tarah se behave karega.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amaal and Daboo get emotional as they talk to each other. Salman expresses concern about the former&rsquo;s inability to control his anger and tongue. The Bollywood star mentions that he is still being trageted for 20-30 years old things which he&nbsp;never did&nbsp;in his past.</p>

Nehal Chudasama requests the actress not to use any shocking remarks against the music composer. Amaal stays firm in his decision that he won&#39;t apologize to Farrhana for anything. However, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-shehbaz-badesha-meet-bigg-boss-13-fame-shehnaaz-gills-brother-whos-a-probable-contestant-of-bigg-boss-19-1395925">Shehbaz </a>makes Amaal understand that he must say sorry to her for his actions. After listening to everyone&#39;s advice, Amaal apologizes to Farrhana.</p>

<h3><strong>Abhishek Bajaj, Ashnoor Kaur and Mridul Tiwari criticize Amaal Mallik</strong></h3>

<p>In the night, we see Abhishek, Ashnoor and Mridul talking to each other about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-promos-farrhana-shreds-neelams-diwali-message-emotional-moments-grip-the-house-1397790">Farrhana </a>and Amaal&rsquo;s clash. They mention that the music composer often hides his friends&rsquo; faults and his opinions are mostly wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Tanya Mittal comments that Malti Chahar behaves like Amaal&rsquo;s girlfriend. Baseer Ali tells Nehal, &ldquo;She (Farrhana Bhatt) is the worst human being I have ever seen.&rdquo; Further, Bigg Boss calls Nehal (the captain of the house) into the confession room and asks if Gaurav Khanna and Neelam Giri violated the rules of the captaincy task.</p>

<p><strong>Nehal Chudasama breaks down as she goes into the confession room&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The master of the house gives her a special power to choose two contestants to whom she would like to give their respective families&rsquo; letters. She takes Baseer and Ashnoor&rsquo;s names. Soon, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/serial-updates/nehal-chudasamas-brother-pens-an-emotional-note-after-salman-khan-questioned-her-achievements-could-feel-the-pain-you-1397470">Nehal </a>starts crying as others, including her, wouldn&#39;t get the letters as the task is cancelled. BB announces no captain for the upcoming week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tanya Mittal breaks down into tears and confesses that she misses her mother a lot. Baseer reads out his letter and Ashnoor gets emotional over her family letter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kunickaa Sadanand calls out Farrhana for not folding her blanket. The latter says that the veteran actress keeps poking at doing the chores, no matter what. In another segment, Pranit More entertains everyone with his stand-up comedy.</p>

If one delivers the family letter, he/she is out of the race. Otherwise, the contestant will end up earning the captaincy contendership. As the task begins, Nehal sacrifices her chance to become captain for the upcoming week by delivering Pranit&#39;s letter.</p>

<p>Further, Baseer delivers Mridul&rsquo;s letter and gives up his captaincy chance. Gaurav also sacrifices his contendership for Kunickaa&rsquo;s letter. As the task continues, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-amaal-malik-everything-to-know-about-bigg-boss-19-contestant-and-his-controversial-life-1396026">Amaal Mallik</a> hands over Farrhana Bhatt&rsquo;s letter to her and loses his captaincy chance.</p>

So, the Laila Majnu actress ends up becoming 1st captaincy contender. In reaction to the same, Neelam breaks down and her housemates console her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Baseer turns furious about Farrhana&#39;s decision and warns her not to call herself his friend. They continue to scream at each other and their friendship falls apart. Abhishek Bajaj also confronts the actress for the same. Latter claims that she didn&#39;t do it for the captaincy but had her own reasons. Tanya Mittal expresses anger at Farrhana and stands up for Neelam.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Amaal Mallik snatches Farrhana Bhatt&#39;s food</strong></h3>

<p>Furthermore, Gaurav Khanna makes a mistake by giving <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-eviction-poll-gaurav-khanna-neelam-giri-mridul-tiwari-or-malti-chahar-who-deserves-to-be-eliminated-this-week-1397697">Neelam </a>pieces of her letter that were shredded by Farrhana. Bigg Boss calls it a violation of rules and cancels the task. All the contestants apologise to Bigg Boss and request that the task be resumed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Amaal loses his cool at Farrhana, snatches her plate, and breaks it in frustration. Both exchange derogatory remarks and despite several attempts by others to control Amaal, he continues to fight with Farrhana.</p>

<p>Kitchen chaos continues. Both drag each other&#39;s families into the ugly spat. The episode ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What starts as a fun interaction between BFFs <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-september-16-promos-abhishek-bajaj-gets-possessive-of-awez-zeishan-quadri-becomes-target-of-the-house-1396899">Abhishek Bajaj</a> and Ashnoor Kaur takes a different turn after he throws her night suit in the pool. The Patiala Babes actor says, &ldquo;It&#39;s not funny,&rdquo; and feels angry about it. She asks him to shut up, and Abhishek tries to calm the situation by drying it. After a while, Malti Chahar engages in a heartfelt conversation with Ashnoor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the night, Tanya confesses that she has been trying to uplift her mood, but is broken from the inside. The next day, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/serial-updates/nehal-chudasamas-brother-pens-an-emotional-note-after-salman-khan-questioned-her-achievements-could-feel-the-pain-you-1397470">Nehal Chudasama</a> asks Abhishek why he didn&#39;t clean the toilet.

Furthermore, Farrhana Bhatt seeks Gaurav&#39;s opinions on her friendship with Nehal Chudasama.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Ration task creates lots of drama&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Bigg Boss asks the contestants to hold a teddy bear, and the moment it touches the ground, a portion of the weekly ration will be cut. In the first round, Malti holds the teddy bear and says that she wants to throw it on the ground so the ration gets half. Her casual approach during the task leaves the contestants furious, and then she throws the teddy in anger.&nbsp;</p>

As he walked through the &lsquo;mukhya dwar&rsquo;of BB House, he hugged everyone as a final goodbye except Tanya Mittal, who fondly called him &lsquo;bhai&rsquo; in the show. And now, in an exclusive chat with Pinkvilla, Zeishan Quadri called Tanya Mittal &lsquo;selfish&rsquo; and questioned his fans whether she is doing everything fair in the house.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-promo-zeishan-qadri-calls-tanya-mittal-a-flipper-as-they-get-into-heated-argument-1396774">Zeishan Quadri </a>said, &ldquo;Kya Tanya (Tanya Mittal) sahi hai? Tanya ki audience se main poochna chahta hu. Last nomination jiski wajah se main samne baitha hua hu. Uss nomination ke baad mujhe taunt maar rahi hai ki aap jaake apni behan (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-malti-chahar-meet-cricketer-deepak-chahars-sister-who-is-expected-to-make-wild-card-entry-in-bigg-boss-19-1397435">Malti Chahar</a>) ke saath hi baitho jisne mujhe swimming pool mein fek diya to aapko usse farak nahi pada. (Is Tanya right? I want to ask Tanya&#39;s audience. The last nomination because of which I am sitting in front of you. After that nomination, she taunted me that go and sit with your sister who threw me in the swimming pool and you did not care about her.)&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gangs of Wassepur writer asked whether she would&#39;ve drowned in the swimming pool. He said, &ldquo;Wo swimming pool kya 780 feet ka tha, usme shark the whale the? Tum doob jaati? Main tumhe bachane nahi aata? Kya tha problem swimming pool se? Sirf ye ki tum saree pahene thi. (Was that swimming pool 780 feet deep, there were sharks and whales in it? You would have drowned? I would not have come to save you? What was the problem with the swimming pool? Just that you were wearing a saree.)&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Zeishan Quadri calls Tanya Mittal a &lsquo;selfish&rsquo; person</strong></h3>

<p>He further called Mittal a selfish person. &ldquo;Aur hum nominated ho gaye, tumhari jigri dost Neelam nominate ho gayi. Tumhe koi parwa hi nahi hai. Aap selfish ho. Agar nahi ho to aake maafi kyun maangi? Kyon realize hua ki tumhe ki tum galat ho? Warna to tum kisi ke baap se maafi na maango. Tum bhi to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-tanya-mittal-breaks-down-remembering-mahakumbh-backlash-says-people-called-me-farzi-1397588">Tanya Mittal</a> ho,&rdquo; added Zeishan Quadri.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(And we got nominated, your best friend Neelam got nominated. You don&#39;t care at all. You are selfish. If not, then why did you come and apologize? When did you realize that you were wrong? Otherwise, you would not apologize to anyone&#39;s father. After all, you are Tanya Mittal.)</p>

<p>Popular as Definite, the actor-writer concluded by appealing to the audience to watch everything carefully before pointing out someone. &ldquo;Audience sab kuch dhyaan se dekho phir kisi pe ungli uthao,&rdquo; concluded Quadri.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mittal breaks down for the Weekend Ka Vaar incident wherein most of the contestants called Neelam as Tanya&rsquo;s &lsquo;chamchi.&rsquo;</p>

<h3><strong>Farrhana Bhatt and Neelam Giri lock horns and clash aggressively&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Nomination unfolds bringing chaos and drama in Bigg Boss 19 house</strong></h3>

<p>In the latter segment, Bigg Boss announces the nomination task. During the task, Mridul and Malti argue. Both talk rudely as they nominate each other.

As the Bollywood superstar returned to the Bigg Boss stage, he dropped some major insight on the contestants&rsquo; performance, making it a dramatic and eventful evening.</p>

<p><strong>Bigg Boss 19: October 11 Episode highlights</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Salman Khan responds to claims of bias toward Amaal Mallik</strong></p>

<p>Salman addressed ongoing accusations of being biased towards Amaal Mallik. He clarified that Amaal has been criticized from all sides, though it may not always appear that way to the outside world.</p>

<p>Salman said he has spoken to Amaal more harshly than to any other contestant, yet people still claim he is either biased in Amaal&#39;s favor or against him. He added that he also advises Kunika regularly, dispelling notions of favoritism.</p>

<p><strong>2. Salman talks about house dynamics after Malti&#39;s entry</strong></p>

<p>Salman asked Malti if she had settled into the house. Malti replied that there are two groups, but she considers herself a backbencher and isn&#39;t aligned with either.</p>

<p>She admitted that she didn&#39;t understand the kitchen politics and, due to exhaustion, had requested fewer and lighter tasks. As she was explaining, Farhana and Nehal interrupted. Salman acknowledged that Malti had joined the show mid-season, and it was natural for her presence to cause insecurity among other contestants.</p>

<p><strong>3. Salman Khan schools Tanya Mittal</strong></p>

<p>Salman directly confronted Tanya Mittal, stating that Malti hadn&#39;t said anything to hurt her. He told Tanya that if people believe she&#39;s &quot;faking&quot; her emotions or actions, she shouldn&#39;t be concerned. He also mocked Tanya for crying after being thrown into the swimming pool during a task.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/was-salman-khan-replaced-in-devdas-by-shah-rukh-khan-because-of-aishwarya-rai-ismail-darbar-breaks-silence-1397573">Salman Khan</a> caught Tanya in a contradiction. When asked why she cried after falling into the pool, Tanya claimed she had intentionally worn a saree for the task. Salman responded, &quot;If you wore it intentionally, then why cry?&quot; He pointed out inconsistencies in her statements and accused her of entering the show with a clear game plan.</p>

<p>He also said that Tanya often threatens to remain silent as a strategy, and called her out for allegedly playing the sympathy card.</p>

<p><strong>4. Zeishan Quadri evicted from Bigg Boss 19</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-september-14-weekend-ka-vaar-episode-highlights-baseer-ali-zeishan-quadri-end-their-friendship-with-nehal-chudasama-1396853">Zeishan Quadri</a>, actor, director, and writer, was evicted from the show this week. Considered one of the strongest contestants and often called the house&#39;s mastermind, Zeishan&#39;s elimination came as a surprise to many.</p>

<p>However, he reportedly received the lowest number of votes among all the nominated contestants, resulting in his eviction.</p>

<p>He further concluded by saying, &ldquo;Ye jo aap dhamki deti rehti ho ki main ab kuch nahi bolungi, aap jo kar rahi hai aap karo, koi farak nahi padta.&rdquo; (You always keep giving threats about you not telling anything to anyone, whatever you are trying to do, you can keep doing. It is not bothering anyone at all.)</p>

<p>For the unversed, the equation in the Bigg Boss 19 house has changed ever since <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-malti-chahar-meet-cricketer-deepak-chahars-sister-who-is-expected-to-make-wild-card-entry-in-bigg-boss-19-1397435">Malti Chahar </a>entered as a wildcard contestant.

<p>On the other hand, Kunickaa claims that Amaal did an inappropriate gesture for Ashnoor, but the singer claims otherwise. Amaal repeatedly says that he hasn&#39;t said anything wrong about anyone. The singer goes to the veteran actor and confronts her about the same. Both scream at each other and exchange pointed remarks. Ashnoor asks Bigg Boss to call her in the confession room.&nbsp;</p>

Furthermore, the veteran actor lashes out at Tanya for not washing the pan.</p>

<h3><strong>Bigg Boss addresses the housemates</strong></h3>

<p>After the contestants decide to continue with the task, the master of the house intervenes, saying, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t his first season, and he doesn&rsquo;t want to be blackmailed like this.&rdquo; Bigg Boss asks them not to take their powers for granted and announces the suspension of the captaincy task. Farrhana Bhatt is to continue as the captain for the next week.</p>

Especially after their stint in the Bigg Boss house, the two often grab all the eyeballs for their personal life. Recently, the businessman was in the hospital after his hand was injured, and we saw the actress by his side constantly to help him during this tough time. But now, she spoke about his health in a video posted on her Instagram handle.</p>

<h2 id="68e367b34397d"><strong>Ankita Lokhande on hubby Vicky Jain&rsquo;s health</strong></h2>

<p>Taking to her Instagram handle, Ankita Lokhande shared a video of herself on the auspicious occasion of Dussehra. She wished her fans and followers and spoke about her hubby Vicky Jain&rsquo;s health after his recent hospitalisation.&nbsp;She said, &ldquo;Isse pehle humare ghar mein bhi bohut saari aesi cheezein huyi jiska anth hona bohut zaruri tha.&rdquo; (Before this, there were several things that took place in my home and which were necessary to end).</p>

<p>She added, &ldquo;Especially Vicky&rsquo;s health. He cut his hand in our house, you know that. We fought with a lot of things. But I must say that Vicky overcame those things very strongly, and today he is taking care of his health. And he is completely fine. Thanks to all of you whose love has given us the strength. Thank you so much.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="68e367b343986"><strong>What happened to Vicky Jain?</strong></h2>

<p>For the unversed, a couple of weeks back, former Bigg Boss 17 contestant Samarth Jurel shared a video straight from the hospital on his Instagram. In the video, we could see Vicky Jain lying on a hospital bed with his right hand plastered and left hand injected with syringes. Ankita Lokhande stood beside him.</p>

<p>The video saw all three <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-17-when-aishwarya-sharma-and-ankita-lokhandes-aggressive-fight-grabbed-eyeballs-watch-1385794">Bigg Boss 17</a> contestants in a light mood. Samarth can be heard saying, &ldquo;Bye Vicky bhai, bye,&rdquo; to which Vicky quickly responded, &ldquo;Bye mat bol yaar.&rdquo; Samarth then reassured him by saying, &ldquo;I mean, I&rsquo;ll meet you in 2 hours.&rdquo; The laughter and teasing in the video brought relief to fans who were&nbsp;concerned about the businessman&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>Three former Bigg Boss 17 contestants who formed a close bond&mdash;and recently appeared together on Laughter Chefs season 2&mdash;are in the news after one of them suffered a serious accident.</p>

<p>Filmmaker Sandeep Singh shared on Instagram that Vicky was involved in a painful incident where multiple pieces of glass cut his hand. The injury was severe, requiring 45 stitches and a three-day hospital stay.</p>

Now, Karan has reacted to the same, questioning why &ldquo;elite women&rdquo; like her get away with what he calls systemic harassment.</p>

<p><strong>Karan Kundrra hits back against ex-GF Anusha Dandekar</strong></p>

<p>In a now-deleted post, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/the-traitors-raj-kundra-to-karan-kundrra-all-the-contestants-who-got-evicted-in-first-3-episodes-1391322">Karan Kundrra</a> lashed out at his ex-girlfriend without directly naming her. Although the actor deleted the note, it quickly circulated online, especially on Reddit.</p>

<p>In the note, Karan wrote, &ldquo;It&#39;s unfortunate that today these cruel elite women can say ANYTHING and they will be applauded and men like me have nowhere to go, we come from small cities work extremely hard, persevere away from our loved ones and NO one supports till the spark is sucked out of you, your vibrant personality becomes a reminiscence of the past and you end up as a justice for.. hashtag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At 4 in the morning, as I lay alone in my bed, consumed with utter disappointment and helplessness, I wonder why these &#39;smash the patriarchy&#39; women with connections to big Bollywood families intoxicated till their eyelids in power, get away with systemic harassment, mental badgering, degrading persecution, why!??&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Karan went on to claim that such individuals employ anonymous media tactics, specifically &lsquo;blind items&rsquo;, to target people and erode their confidence. He claimed that these small, repeated actions systematically break down a person&rsquo;s strength. He concluded with the controversial statement that because &ldquo;woke women&rdquo; often face no accountability, many successful men in the country tragically end up taking their own lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Anusha Dandekar said&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-anusha-dandekar-is-keeping-up-with-love-as-she-poses-with-kim-khloe-kardashian-1327802">Anusha Dandekar</a> recently appeared on the YouTube channel Unverified &mdash; The Podcast, where she seemingly took an indirect jab at Karan Kundrra.</p>

<p>Without naming him, Anusha revealed that she and an ex-boyfriend were once signed up for a campaign on a dating app. However, she alleged that the same ex used the app to chat with other women while still being in a relationship with her.</p>

<p>The actress further claimed that she only discovered her ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s infidelity much later and alleged that by that time, he had allegedly been &ldquo;sleeping with all of Mumbai.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said that the singer has always apologized to him within 10 minutes of any altercation between them, stating that he&rsquo;s dubbed the &lsquo;sorry man&rsquo; in the house. He expressed confusion over Amaal Mallik&rsquo;s starkly different statements, with one being when he admitted to being good friends, and then on the same day, taking off the mic to make alleged claims. Awez Darbar shared that if he had known of the latter&rsquo;s actions before, he would have given a fitting reply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tu hai asli saanp, jisko mai bol raha tha first day pe ki tu jis gang ke sath ghum raha hai, sab dassenge teko. Mai bol raha hu, mat reh aise.

<p>Later, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/tanya-mittal-net-worth-2025-is-bigg-boss-19-contestant-earning-rs-6-lakh-every-month-find-out-1396278">Tanya Mittal</a> was seen talking to Farrhana Bhatt about how Nehal poisoned her mind by saying Salman Khan was actually roasting her by making her sit on the Queen&#39;s chair during Weekend Ka War. Tanya said that she wants clarity from Bigg Boss on this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kunickaa and Zeishan were later spotted arguing. Kunickaa alleged that she feels Zeishan has a problem with the females who have their voices and opinions. To which Quadri retaliated and asked if she had watched Wasseypur (Gangs of Wasseypur). Zeishan further made his point, saying he had grown up among strong women, and that&#39;s not what she was thinking. Kunickaa mentioned that he has a problem with Nehal only because she is strong. To which Zeishan asked whether Farrhana was weak.&nbsp;</p>

Zeishan went to Abhishek and Ashnoor and tried to manipulate their minds by presenting his theory that Farrhana might be trying to join their group, which is why she placed him at 17th, rather than her close friends, Nehal and Baseer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ranking of all the contestants led Bigg Boss to organise ration shopping for the week. Bigg Boss asked everyone to shop according to their ranking. Meanwhile, Pranit was seen criticizing Farrhana Bhatt&#39;s captaincy as a big failure. He mentioned that neither of them can manage the house nor the duties.<br />
Later on, a fun contest occurred when Shehbaz Badesha, who had won the highest ranking, was asked to name the contestants with whom the contest statements synced well. Shehbaz made the contest even more fun with his humor and comedy. At night, Shehbaz was seen stealing eggs from Pranit&#39;s stock, which Baseer used to cook omelets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the morning, Zeishan Quadri informed Ashnoor that he had stolen three eggs from Pranit&#39;s stock. He gave her three eggs and asked her to please put them in More&#39;s stock. Shehbaz didn&#39;t like Quadri giving eggs back to them. Amaal later questioned Zeishan about why he was becoming a saint, and they continued arguing about the same matter. Amaal, meanwhile, said that he didn&#39;t like how Zeishan was involved and having fun talks with the other group. The singer asked what if he started having a chat with Nehal.</p>

<p>Later on, Zeishan Quadri was seen in anger, saying to the camera that no one needs to vote for him out of favor. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-shehbaz-badesha-meet-bigg-boss-13-fame-shehnaaz-gills-brother-whos-a-probable-contestant-of-bigg-boss-19-1395925">Shehbaz Badesha</a> started taking digs at Ashnoor and Abhishek in a playful manner, which later escalated into a serious argument. Abhishek said stop faking like your sister. To which, Shehbaz warned Abhishek not to drag his sister, Shehnaaz Gill&#39;s name, into the argument. By the end of the episode, Shehbaz and Abhishek made up and agreed that no one would drag each other&#39;s family into their arguments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The show ended with Captain Farrhana sprinkling water on Abhishek while he was sleeping, which led to a heated argument between Abhishek&#39;s group and Farrhana. Ashnoor and Mridul came to support Abhishek and questioned whether she had the right to do it. Later on, Kunickaa interfered and sided with Abhishek.</p>

<p>After the nomination task, Neelam confronts Kunickaa for supporting Nehal&rsquo;s statement about Tanya that she hasn&#39;t struggled but has been served with everything by her parents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gradually, the issue snowballs into a huge issue.

Nehal keeps yelling at Tanya. On the other hand, the latter becomes angry at her for dragging her parents into the fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later in the house, Kunickaa asks Shehbaz not to change clothes openly, but in the bathroom. The latter clarifies his stand, and the veteran actor mentions that her only concern is decency. Shehbaz says he has issues with her waxing in the laundry area.</p>

<p>Further, Farrhana and Kunickaa open up about life hardships. The former talks about her parents getting separated and calls marriage &lsquo;scary.&rsquo; Kunickaa recalls her first divorce, saying, &ldquo;Mai 9 saal apne bete ke liye ladi.&rdquo;</p>

Zeishan Quadri and Abhishek Bajaj lock horns over the cleanliness of gym equipment. During lunch, the Parvarrish actor creates noise with his plates to disturb Amaal. Neelam prepares halwa, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/kunickaa-sadanands-son-ayaan-reveals-her-relationship-with-kumar-sanu-was-very-toxic-she-used-to-look-at-him-as-1396692">Kunickaa Sadanand</a> points out the portion of halwa Baseer Ali took out for himself. The Splitsvilla 10 winner justifies his portion.</p>

<h3><strong>Nehal Chudasama and Baseer Ali&#39;s ugly spat shakes Bigg Boss 19 house</strong></h3>

<p>Later, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/nehal-chudasama-physically-assaulted-by-man-shes-known-for-2-years-in-mumbai-chilling-details-shake-fans-1375943">Nehal </a>questions the share of halwa Baseer kept for himself. She claims that many of the housemates haven&#39;t eaten, and the issue gradually snowballs into a verbal fight. Nehal tells Baseer, &quot;Chori aur seena zori.&quot; While they continue to lash out at each other, Zeishan feels that such a clash was not needed, as halwa was prepared for Tanya&#39;s birthday.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Baseer and Nehal get into a massive fight. The former turns furious and becomes extremely angry. He even charges at her, and Kunickaa comes to push him away from Nehal. Other housemates intervene to stop them. Their major fallout creates chaos in the house. Ali&#39;s pointed remarks at Kunickaa only add fuel to the fire.</p>

<h3><strong>Farrhana Bhatt and Kunickaa Sadanand yell at each other</strong></h3>

<p>Baseer comments that Kunickaa still gets involved in the kitchen even though she has been asked not to. So, the veteran actor asks him not to talk stupidly behind her back. She comments on how Farrhana Bhatt failed as a captain. As a result, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-new-promo-baseer-ali-throws-farhana-bhatts-blanket-in-the-pool-after-heated-argument-1396309">Farrhana </a>and Kunickaa engage in a bitter argument.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day, Kunickaa, Pranit, and Abhishek talk to Farrhana about the housemates not doing their duties. The stand-up comedian claims Shehbaz didn&#39;t clean the door glasses, and ultimately, the entire issue turns into a heated argument. Meanwhile, Abhishek calls Amaal &#39;paltu.&#39; In the kitchen area, Pranit and Shehbaz taunt each other. Lastly, Nehal talks to Amaal about Tanya taking an interest in him, and the singer shares the same with his group.</p>

Awez claims that the singer escalated the fight because he saw Tanya Mittal laughing. Meanwhile, Baseer Ali and Pranit More get into an ugly spat and taunt each other. The comedian says that Baseer and Amaal almost got physical with him. So, Abhishek Bajaj confronts them for the same.</p>

<h3><strong>Farrhana Bhatt and Ashnoor Kaur compete for weekly ration</strong></h3>

<p>Abhishek, being the captain, gets special access to the app room. Bigg Boss announces that he can choose any of the female contestants as the contender for the captaincy task, but with a condition. The actor chooses Ashnoor Kaur.</p>

<p>Later, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-salman-khan-slams-farrhana-bhatt-for-her-do-kaudi-ki-aurat-comment-on-neelam-giri-you-are-a-woman-1396522">Farrhana&nbsp;Bhatt</a> is declared the second contender for the captaincy task. Further, the ration task unfolds with Farrhana and Ashnoor as opponents. At the end, Farrhana wins, with Ashnor losing the advantage of being one of the contenders for the captaincy task. Awez says that the Patiala Babes actor played fair. Gradually, the house turns chaotic over the weekly ration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the night, Pranit and Gaurav discuss the ongoing development. The stand-up comedian mentions that they always lose the task and discuss Mridul Tiwari.</p>

<h3><strong>Farrhana Bhatt and Kunickaa Sadanand clash with each other</strong></h3>

On the other hand, Gaurav talks to Mridul to clear his stand. Then, we see Tanya narrating the mythological tale of Krishna and Radha to Amaal.</p>

<p>Further, each housemate reviews <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/bigg-boss-19-promo-housemates-split-over-abhisheks-captaincy-with-baseer-ali-calling-him-out-mudon-ko-dabana-is-1397152?amp">Abhishek&#39;s</a> captaincy. Baseer, Tanya, Farrhana, and Amaal criticize the Parvarrish actor. They claim that Ashnoor acted like a vice captain and Bajaj was a puppet to her. After all the votes, he is declared a successful captain. Later, Farrhana and Kunickaa fight. The former calls the Taish actor a &#39;stupid&#39; woman.</p>

<p>Ashnoor warns Bhatt not to use derogatory remarks for Kunickaa. However, Farrhana keeps lashing out at the veteran actor. With the task underway, the episode comes to a close. A major drama is expected to shake the house in the next episode.</p>

Three months after her unfortunate demise, her husband and actor Parag Tyagi launched a YouTube channel in her memory. While dropping the first podcast, Parag talked about what happened that day and whether it was an accident.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parag Tyagi reveals having a premonition about the tragedy</strong></h3>

<p>Filled with tears in his eyes, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-parag-tyagi-all-about-shefali-zariwalas-2nd-husband-who-rose-to-fame-with-pavitra-rishta-1392450">Parag Tyagi</a> recalled the final day of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/what-happened-hours-before-shefali-jariwalas-demise-close-friend-pooja-ghai-confirms-shocking-truth-1392645">Shefali Jariwala</a> and opened up on little-known aspects of their lives. He mentioned that he had a premonition that something tragic would happen. Parag revealed that he took his pets on a walk. Meanwhile, he got a call from home that Shefali is unwell and struggling to breathe. He said, &ldquo;Breathing ek ya do bar aayi, lekin body puri chhod chuki thi, main utha nahi pa raha tha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they rushed to the hospital, the doctor declared that she was no more. &ldquo;CPR mouth-to-mouth deke thodi si breathing lagi, awaz bhi aayi, but phir unhone kaha cornea move nahi kar raha hai,&quot; Tyagi added in a crackling voice.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parag Tyagi recalls how Shefali used to plan everything for the future&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>The<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/pavitra-rishta-fame-priya-marathe-passes-away-at-38-following-a-battle-with-cancer-1396280"> Pavitra Rishta</a> actor further revealed that she used to plan everything for the future. While he asked her not to plan but to do everything now, she used to say, &quot;No, no, let&rsquo;s wait a little more, more money will come, then we can do everything easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emotional Parag talked about the universal truth about time, &ldquo;We never know what will happen and when. There were so many things we still wanted to do. In life, we plan so much - what to earn, what to achieve - but in the end, it all slips away from our hands. She was wearing one of her favourite t-shirts, comfortable and paired with her pajamas. That&rsquo;s all. Her jewelry, her branded clothes, her goggles, everything she loved collecting, were all left behind. She had such a passion for surrounding herself with beautiful things, and now it&rsquo;s all just left as it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the unversed, Parag Tyagi has recently opened an NGO, Shefali Jariwalai Rise Foundation, in the name of his wife. The actor is fulfilling his wife&#39;s ultimate dream of providing education to unprivileged kids and empowering women.&nbsp;</p>

Bigg Boss exposes housemates&#39; discussion about nomination ahead of the task, which he declares is against the rules. So, as punishment, the master of the house announces that all contestants, except Amaal Mallik, remain on the verge of getting nominated.</p>

<p>Later, BB gives them a chance to take two names whom they want to save from this week&#39;s nomination. After everyone votes, the task comes to an end. With the least number of votes, 5 contestants get nominated in the third week. These names are Pranit More, Baseer Ali, Abhishek Bajaj, Ashnoor Kaur, and Nehal Chudasma.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Ashnoor Kaur feels bad about not saving Abhishek Bajaj</strong></h3>

<p>During the voting process, Ashnoor Kaur mentions that she wishes to save Tanya Mittal and Gaurav Khanna. Later, when Abhishek Bajaj realizes that she didn&#39;t take his name, he feels disappointed. Awez Darbar also questions her about the same.</p>

<p>Therefore, she begins crying, and Awez consoles her. Abhishek also comes to her, and they let go of whatever happened.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Amaal Mallik and Baseer Ali share a candid conversation. The singer recalls his childhood and shares how he faced several hardships, but has a heart strong enough to deal with adverse situations.</p>

<h3><strong>Captaincy task leaves Bigg Boss 19 house chaotic</strong></h3>

<p>Later, in the episode, the captaincy task unfolds. The house gets divided into two teams.</p>

<p><strong>Team A: </strong>Ashnoor Kaur, Abhishek Bajaj, Zeishan Quadri, Neelam Giri, Tanya Mittal, Mridul Tiwari, and Shehbaz Badesha</p>

<p><strong>Team B: </strong>Baseer Ali, Gaurav Khanna, Nehal Chudasama, Awez Darbar, Pranit More, Kunickaa Sadanand, and Farhana Bhatt.</p>

<p>The team that collects the highest number of gold coins and bags and fills the crates will win the task. During the game, Neelam Giri, Tanya Mittal, and Nehal Chudasama turn aggressive. Amaal Mallik, being the &#39;sanchalak,&rsquo; makes sure the housemates play fairly. He even asks the female players not to put the bags inside their t-shirts, as they will then have issues with the male players touching them inappropriately. However, before the task concludes, the episode comes to an end.</p>

The duo also hides other housemates&#39; clothes and stuff just for fun. They put Baseer&#39;s, Awez&#39;s, and Abhishek&#39;s clothes under the sofa. In the morning, everyone is baffled. Baseer Ali warns that he would lose his cool with whoever has done the prank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The entire house turns chaotic as everyone discusses who might have pulled off the prank. Since Amaal and Badesha also hid the salt, the contestants eat breakfast without it.</p>

<h3><strong>Bigg Boss clarifies not hiding housemates&#39; belongings&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Later, a heated argument between <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/serial-updates/bigg-boss-19-promo-who-stole-food-from-kitchen-amaal-mallik-and-gaurav-khanna-check-contestants-bags-1396903">Amaal Malik</a> and Abhishek Bajaj shakes the house. They argue as the latter throws his t-shirt in the kitchen dustbin.</p>

<p>On the other hand, although Amaal Malik was involved in the act, he pretends as if he hasn&#39;t done anything. The singer even asks Bigg Boss to look into the matter. Later, the master of the house clarifies that such an act is not the format of the show and has nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>Following the announcement, everyone suspects <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/updates/who-is-shehbaz-badesha-meet-bigg-boss-13-fame-shehnaaz-gills-brother-whos-a-probable-contestant-of-bigg-boss-19-1395925">Shehbaz Badesha </a>and doubts him about the missing things. Gradually, he tells Zeishan Quadri, Mridul Tiwari, and Neelam Giri and asks them not to tell anyone. But the Bhojpuri actress announces the same in the house, and the housemates express disappointment in him.</p>

<p>Abhishek Bajaj urges Bigg Boss to take action against Shehbaz as he played with housemates&#39; health by hiding salt and sugar. As the issue snowballs into a major development, Baseer Ali confronts Badesha about who else helped him in doing so. Abhishek repeats that Shehbaz must be eliminated.</p>

<p>However, Zeishan Quadri backs Shehbaz, mentioning that the act didn&#39;t earn him any personal gain but was just fun. Amaal tells Shehbaaz that housemates are planning to boycott him, will be given multiple duties, and cigarettes will not be given to him.</p>

<h3><strong>Nomination task</strong></h3>

After a while, Amaal Malik assigns the duty of lunch to Nehal. She mentions that it&#39;ll be difficult for her as she is strict about her workout schedule, but the Captain asks her to adjust. The entire issue escalates when they get into an argument, and Amaal turns strict towards her.</p>

<h3><strong>Kunickaa Sadanand&#39;s heated argument with Amaal Malik</strong></h3>

<p>Later, in the episode, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-captaincy-task-baseer-ali-and-awez-darbar-get-into-heated-argument-former-tells-latter-tere-kisse-kholu-kya-1396732">Awez Darbar</a> and Pranit More are seen talking to Farhana Bhatt and Nehal Chudasama, and offer to join their group.

<p>Further, at one instance, Kunickaa Sadanand narrates the incident about how Ashnoor Kaur asked her whether she was sleeping with her from now on. The veteran actress explains that she said no, to which the Patiala Babes actress had replied that she had a problem sharing a bed with Nehal because of her smoking habit.</p>

<p>During late night, Neelam Giri is seen picking out rotten vegetables. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/bigg-boss-19-august-31-weekend-ka-vaar-episode-highlights-no-eviction-kunickaa-resigns-from-captaincy-13963024">Kunickaa </a>asks Ashnoor to help Neelam, but she walks away, saying she has some stuff to arrange. When Kunickaa repeatedly mentions that no one came to help Neelam, Amaal loses his cool. He warns the Fugly actor that she won&#39;t enter the kitchen unless any duty is assigned to her.</p>

<p>Both shout at each other, and their verbal spat turns worse after Amaal says that everyone will inform him about everything.</p>

<h3><strong>Shehbaz Badesha and Abhishek Bajaj almost get into a physical fight</strong></h3>

<p>On the other hand, Shehbaz confronts Abhishek for attacking Kunickaa for being in the kitchen. He calls him out for asking her to make halwa, but then questioning her for taking the kitchen duties into her hands. Both clash and other housemates come to separate them to avoid the spat from turning worse.</p>

<p>The next day, Nehal informs that lunch will be delayed as she will start preparing it after the workout.

<p>As the discussion continues, Pranit comments that he has no issues with either of the choices. This statement leads to an argument with Amaal. Lastly, Nehal expresses anger at Amaal as he calls her &#39;kaamchor.&#39; After the former cries, Farhana advocates for Nehal in front of Amaal. The episode ends.</p>

However, one contestant who is in the news every day is Tanya Mittal. The content creator and entrepreneur is currently the talk of the town for leading a wealthy lifestyle that many can only dream of. Amid this, reports about her net worth and monthly income are making headlines.</p>

<h2 id="68c7e65d2ea49"><strong>Tanya Mittal&#39;s net worth of 2025 and monthly earnings</strong></h2>

<p>According to Times Now, Tanya Mittal&#39;s personal income is said to be over Rs 6 lakhs per month. Her earnings come from brand collaborations, endorsements, and her businesses. Reportedly, her estimated net worth is around Rs 2 crores, which makes her one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs to join Bigg Boss 19. Also, Tanya owns luxurious cars, branded sarees, and many other expensive items that serve as proof of her wealth.</p>

<p>Speaking about her professional journey, Tanya decided to venture into entrepreneurship at the age of 19. She started a business in handbags and handcrafted accessories with an initial investment of just Rs 500. She later expanded into fashion, business, and content creation, quickly gaining popularity on social media.</p>

<h2 id="68c7e65d2ea52"><strong>Why is Tanya Mittal trending?</strong></h2>

<p>Tanya Mittal attracted attention with her participation in<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/serial-updates/why-did-salman-khan-school-pranit-more-during-bigg-boss-19s-first-weekend-ka-vaar-find-out-1396266"> Bigg Boss 19</a>.

<p>Throughout the show, Tanya often emphasized her journey, explaining that she has struggled a lot and is a self-made woman. She also shared that she had no experience with house chores.</p>

He then interacts with the contestants and shares his thoughts on this season. Throughout the episode, Salman has a playful conversation with the contestants.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/newswrap-august-26-salman-khan-completes-37-years-in-film-industry-war-2-and-coolie-gross-over-rs-800-crore-worldwide-1396138">Salman Khan</a> revealed that Amaal Mallik had sent a message to a special someone while speaking to the camera. Amaal expressed his wish that this special person was watching the show. To Amaal&#39;s surprise, Salman announced that they had brought his special person onto the show. Although Amaal was taken aback, Salman playfully teased him by introducing random people.</p>

<p>Salman then asked Nehal if she considered Gaurav a &quot;green flag,&quot; to which she denied. The host inquired if Gaurav could see the true colors of his fellow contestants, and he mentioned that he was trying to understand everyone.</p>

<p>Salman questioned Nehal about her tears over not getting food. He reminded her that there were fruits available in the house, which would have been a good option. The host then asked Abhishek for his opinion, and he suggested that Nehal has a pattern and is aware of the possible outcomes of her actions. Salman also asked Nehal why she did not like Kunickaa&#39;s thick parathas. Nehal claimed that her issue was with Kunickaa&#39;s tone, but Salman noted that the audience does not think Kunickaa is rude.</p>

<h2 id="68c145f87c217"><strong>Contestants give titles to each other</strong></h2>

<p>Salman praised Kunickaa, saying she acted as captain of the house even before her it was announced. He then played a game with her, asking who she thought was the &quot;chill&quot; contestant. Kunickaa named Ashnoor but explained that while Ashnoor is calm, she speaks up when necessary.</p>

<p>When asked to name a contestant who is always angry, Kunickaa Sadanand mentioned Abhishek. She also said that Gaurav is someone who filters comments and speaks. Gaurav was then asked who he thinks provokes others and stirs up conflict, to which he named Tanya. Farrhana was asked who she believed was the &quot;chamcha&quot; of the house, and she named Baseer.</p>

<p>Finally, Amaal was asked who he considered the &quot;dustbin&quot; of the house, and he pointed to Kunickaa.</p>

<h2 id="68c145f87c224"><strong>Salman Khan calls out Gaurav Khanna</strong></h2>

<p>Kunickaa is asked whose behavior bothered her the most, and she names Gaurav. Gaurav is questioned for wanting Ashnoor to be the captain. He explains that he wanted to see Ashnoor&#39;s performance, but Salman points out that Gaurav preferred Ashnoor because he thought she was weak. Salman says that he could take control of the household duties if Ashnoor was the captain. Gaurav shares his perspective.</p>

<p>Salman playfully teases Tanya about her desire to be called a boss, informing her that everyone is talking about her, and not in a positive way. Tanya defends herself, stating that she is opinionated, which leads others to gang up against her. Kunickaa shows her support for Tanya.</p>

<h2 id="68c145f87c22c"><strong>Salman Khan slams Pranit More</strong></h2>

<p>Salman calls out <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/tv/serial-updates/why-did-salman-khan-school-pranit-more-during-bigg-boss-19s-first-weekend-ka-vaar-find-out-1396266">Pranit More</a> for being Tanya&#39;s &quot;satellite,&quot; claiming he only makes jokes at her because she doesn&#39;t seem to be bothered by them. He reminds Pranit of the jokes he has made about him. Salman compares Pranit to comedians like Kapil Sharma, Krushna Abhishek, and Kiku Sharda, noting that they do comedy without crossing the line. He encourages Pranit to continue his comedic efforts but advises him to be mindful, as not everyone has the same understanding.</p>

<h2 id="68c145f87c231"><strong>Tanya Mittal cries after being hurt by Zeishan&#39;s words</strong></h2>

<p>Later, Tanya breaks down when she recalls the names people have called her. She cries, remembering Zeishan Quadri calling her &#39;chudail&#39; and &#39;naagin&#39;. Amaal also apologises to her as he often made fun of her. Tanya confesses how she has been good to everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gaurav expresses disappointment that Ashnoor did not show her support. Baseer advises Pranit not to play along with the group.</p>

<p>Pranit asks if she was hurt by the jokes, and Tanya Mittal admits that she was upset and begins to cry. Pranit reassures Tanya that he has always joked about her in her presence and never talked about her behind her back, which leads to a small argument. Tanya says that Pranit often makes fun of her journey. Tanya asks him not to discuss this topic. However, whenever he discusses, Tanya gets upset, explaining how she cannot argue with him and calls him out for fighting with her.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="68c145f87c235"><strong>Baaghi 4 cast interact with contestants&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Rajiv pointed out that Gaurav excelled in making desserts, so he focused on creating only desserts during Celebrity MasterChef.</p>

<p>The Bigg Boss 15 clarified that winning Celebrity MasterChef does not make Gaurav a chef, as he wouldn&#39;t be able to cook for 20 people. Rajiv stated, &quot;Cooking on a mass scale is very different.&quot; He added that he had tasted Indian food made by Gaurav and didn&#39;t like it.</p>

<p>Rajiv added, &quot;Cake hota toh banata, dessert hota toh banata (He would have made a cake or a dessert).&quot;</p>

With players exhibiting their inner feelings, chaos is sure to unfold.</p>

<p><strong>Change in housemates&rsquo; attitudes after nomination</strong></p>

<p>After this week&rsquo;s nominations for Bigg Boss 19, a noticeable shift in attitude has taken place between contestants. As tensions crept in, Gaurav Khanna appears to be the main target, with him even mentioning that his duties have been changed.</p>

<p>Moreover, singer Amaal Mallik remarks that Gaurav is acting like his &ldquo;mother&rdquo; nagging him about writing.</p>

<p>As the day progressed, Tanya Mittal was seen in a conversation with Kunika, revealing that everyone keeps asking her personal questions, which makes her compelled to explain.</p>

<p>Kunika responded by saying that Tanya isn&rsquo;t here to extend her marriage proposal to anyone and should refrain from sharing too much about herself.</p>

<p><strong>Gaurav Khanna reveals his wife doesn&rsquo;t want children, but he does</strong></p>

<p>Gaurav Khanna was seen having a heart-to-heart conversation with Mridul, who asked whether he ever wanted children. Gaurav admitted that he does, but his wife does not.</p>

<p>He explains, &ldquo;A child is a big responsibility. I work all day, and if she (his wife) also finds a job, it wouldn&rsquo;t be right to leave the child in someone else&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response, Mridul added, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, maybe after 2-3 years,&rdquo; to which Gaurav agreed.</p>

<p><strong>Gaurav struggles with duties and gets into a food argument</strong></p>

<p>As part of his household duties, Gaurav Khanna is tasked with doing the dishes, which leaves him completely exhausted. He tells Tanya that he needs more people for help. Zeeshan chimes in, pointing out that when he made the same complaint earlier, Gaurav brushed it off.</p>

<p>Chaos continued when Gaurav was questioned about eating too much dal. He claims that the dal was well-cooked and that only a small quantity had been made to begin with.</p>

<p>While Nagma agreed that the dal quantity was low, an argument broke out when Nehal confronted Gaurav, &ldquo;Why did you take so much dal?&rdquo; This further escalates when Zeeshan, Amaal and Nehal strongly criticize Gaurav, with Zeeshan even calling him &ldquo;ill-mannered.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Amaal Mallik shares a message to a special person</strong></p>

<p>During the day, Amaal Mallik expressed his affection for a special someone, without taking their name.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;I want to send a message to someone. I&rsquo;m not messing around here. I&rsquo;m not going to find anyone else. When we meet after this show, we&rsquo;ll have a proper conversation. It&rsquo;s only been three days, and I miss you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Does Basheer regret his friendship with Nehal?</strong></p>

<p>Basheer confided in Zeeshan about how Nehal tends to fixate on certain things. This makes him wonder if becoming friends with her was a mistake.</p>

<p>Later, Basheer and Nehal were spotted talking about the other housemates, but Abhishek and Awez suspect that there may be a romance developing between them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kunika and Abhishek got into a spat over making the bed. Kunika asked Abhishek to make his bed, but he snapped back and emphasized that he would only do it when he feels like it.</p>

<p>This further angered Kunika, who said, &ldquo;There are cameras everywhere, you have to keep it clean.&rdquo;</p>

The first episode was full of surprises as Farrhana Bhatt, one of the contestants this season, was evicted by the other contestants.

Tanya Mittal shares with Kunickaa that her father will be upset seeing her doing house chores. However, Kunickaa assures her that her father will be proud. Tanya, on the other hand, mentions that her father would be worried about her being in the Bigg Boss house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone wakes up after the music plays. Baseer Ali states that he doesn&#39;t want to eat food made by Kunickaa, as she tends to make a big deal out of it.</p>

<h2 id="68c14652c07c6"><strong>Tanya Mittal gets offended&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Tanya discusses with Ashnoor Kaur and Awez Darbar how the person in charge of chopping vegetables should wake up early to cook. Tanya explains that she had to do the chopping because the person in charge was still sleeping. Ashnoor points out that it&#39;s impossible to wake up early every day, suggesting that the vegetables should be chopped the night before and kept ready.</p>

<p>When Tanya interrupts, Ashnoor asks her to wait. Tanya becomes offended by Ashnoor&#39;s tone. She tells Awez that her suggestion about the person in charge waking up early was valid. She also mentions that Ashnoor is too young to understand. However, Ashnoor retorts saying that she isn&#39;t young.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nehal Chudasama tells Nagma how Abhishek Bajaj eats chicken and eggs at any time, without considering whether there&#39;s enough for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, Nehal and Amaal discuss how Gaurav is loud and seeks attention. The contestants crack jokes about Farrhana, after which Pranit says that Farrhana never got a chance to use her suitcase since she was evicted on the first day. Farrhana overhears their conversation.</p>

<h2 id="68c14652c07d3"><strong>Nehal Chudasama breaks down</strong></h2>

<p>Nehal&nbsp;Chudasama bursts out in anger when she realizes that there is no chicken left for her and decides not to eat. She claims that there is no food left for her and questions Abhishek as the food gets over. Abhishek explains that he has eaten one piece, and there is one left for her. However, Nehal continues to cry, saying that despite cooking for everyone, there is nothing left for her to eat.</p>

<p>Gaurav encourages her to eat whatever food is left, but she gets emotional, stating that there is no chicken for her. Baseer offers her a piece of chicken and rice, but she feels heartbroken, saying it is too little. Kunickaa informs Abhishek that Nehal didn&rsquo;t cook the food. Farrhana Bhatt witnesses the fighting over food.</p>

<p>Amaal suggests there should be proper food division. Abhishek insists that he hasn&rsquo;t eaten all the food. The contestants start discussing the possibility of Farrhana returning.

<p>Neelam tells Gaurav he is loud, and he agrees. She questions why he never talks to her, and Gaurav replies that it&rsquo;s because she often brings someone else instead of coming alone.</p>

<p>Awez becomes emotional while talking to Nagma. Nagma reveals that Awez is overwhelmed by the nomination process, and Kunickaa hugs her. Nagma advises him not to feel the need to explain his decisions.</p>

<p>Zeishan encourages Tanya not to let the nominations affect her, telling her not to worry about the voting, as she has a huge fan following.
