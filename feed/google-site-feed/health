Here's how he makes the most of his day]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/666923989_microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-1-1.jpg"></img><p><strong>He wakes up every day at 7 A.M and sleeps at?</strong></p>

<p>Satya Nadella&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/fitness/milind-somans-mother-usha-soman-at-85-might-just-be-inspiration-you-needed-for-active-lifestyle-1390198">morning routine</a> is attentively concocted to accelerate productivity. These practices include both physical and mental activities. He knows that rest is important to reinstate energy to take on the day with maximum effort. It appears that he solely believes in the proverb, &ldquo;Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.&rdquo; Like most of his peers, the tech tycoon is an early riser. He wakes up every day at 7 A.M after getting eight hours of sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After getting up and before commencing his busy schedule, he takes some time to reflect on himself and practice acknowledgment. Just reminding himself of what he is thankful for and staying humble does wonders. Satya adopted this practice many years ago, and it is highly recommended by sports psychologists who work with the Seattle Seahawks.</p>

<p>In a podcast with Jessi Hempel, he mentioned that no matter how busy he is or where he is located, he tries to get a half-hour gym session to reinvigorate his body and mind. He doesn&rsquo;t wish to come off as a &ldquo;know-it-all&rdquo; and is always eager to learn. To stimulate his mind, he gets on calls with two executives to keep himself updated, ranging from sports mentors to entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking back at his journey, Satya describes his past outlook as &ldquo;provincial.&rdquo; His life would have turned out completely differently had his father not pushed him out of it. He doesn&rsquo;t want to forget about his roots. He practices humility, a quality that helped him become a competent business leader.&nbsp;</p>

According to reports, he began his weight loss journey in 2024. With an ideal combination of diet, medical interventions, and exercise, he improved his overall health and well-being.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Details of Elon Musk&rsquo;s Dietary Habits During Weight Loss&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Upon being asked about his diet, Elon finally disclosed on X that he kept tasty foods out of sight. Secondly, a practice of eating within a specific time window turned out to be a game-changer. Alongside intermittent fasting, what worked wonders was Wegovy, a weekly injectable medication, designed for diabetes management. Since the weight-loss drug alone won&rsquo;t suffice, Musk incorporated healthy lifestyle habits to remain fit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Elon Musk avoided munching in between meals. Reportedly, he swapped sugary, salty, and high-calorie snacks with wholesome, fibre-rich, and nutrient-filled foods. Such a habit helped cut fat and maintain weight.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick glimpse of his dietary approach:</p>

<p><strong>High-Protein, Low-Carb Diet</strong></p>

<p>To maintain his energy levels, the 53-year-old businessman incorporated lean proteins, vegetables, and healthy fats into his diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mindful Eating</strong></p>

<p>He practiced mindful eating to improve overall nutritional intake. Hence, he vouched for whole foods and reduced the intake of processed items.</p>

<p><strong>Portion Control</strong></p>

<p>Another success mantra of Elon Musk&rsquo;s physical transformation was portion control. He preferred occasional indulgences and avoided overdoing it.</p>

<h2 id="6842fa54645bd"><strong>What is Elon Musk&#39;s Exercise Routine?</strong></h2>

<p>Elon Musk once confessed that he has never been a fan of workouts. Instead of hitting the gym and indulging in a variety of exercises, he preferred a doughnut treat. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case when he was on his weight loss journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To lose weight, Musk engaged in various workouts, including resistance training, cardiovascular exercises, and stretching. He also opted for walking or cycling for short distances, took the stairs instead of elevators, and participated in several outdoor sports.</p>

<p>Last but not least, throughout his weight loss journey, the Tesla boss focused on enhancing his mental health. With improvements in energy levels, he also experienced mental clarity. Undoubtedly, he attributed all physical changes to his healthier lifestyle. Today, Elon Musk not only stands as an inspiration for people worldwide but also acts as a testament to perseverance, dedication, and determination!&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Makhana (foxnuts) instead of chips:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Anshula loves indulging in makhanas and shared in the video that she roasts the superfood using different flavors at home. She even uses it for chaat and describes the food as absolutely &ldquo;yum.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Bajra or jowar chapati instead of whole wheat chapati:&nbsp;</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For a gluten-free meal, Anshula prefers bajra or jowar rotis instead of whole wheat chapatis. In the video, she stated that once you make the switch, you&rsquo;ll feel the &ldquo;difference.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Unsweetened Greek yogurt instead of regular curd:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Anshula loves consuming unsweetened Greek yogurt and calls it a great &ldquo;protein snack&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Sorghum or amaranth bread instead of regular bread:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The 34-year-old Internet celebrity ditches regular bread and instead consumes sorghum or amaranth bread for breakfast. This is a great gluten-free option for her to kick-start her day.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Liquid I.V. instead of packaged soda:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever she has the urge to drink something flavored, she opts for liquid I.V. &mdash; she stated in the post that she loves it because it &ldquo;hydrates and comes in so many flavors.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Making these small changes helps Anshula stay healthy and fit, and manage symptoms of PCOS effectively. She encourages women dealing with PCOS to not &ldquo;sacrifice taste to eat better.&rdquo; In the post, she encouraged the &ldquo;PCOS girlies&rdquo; to try these swaps and see the difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PCOS brings about a lot of change in a woman&rsquo;s body &mdash; navigating through the complexities of the health issue is a transformational journey altogether. Anshula Kapoor has always been bold and courageous enough to talk about health issues in public &mdash; one can take cues from her food swaps and make changes to one&rsquo;s diet. However, it is always recommended to consult a medical practitioner before making any changes to your diet and lifestyle &mdash; especially when dealing with PCOS.&nbsp;</p>

These food items are usually low in fiber, contain added sugar and preservatives, and are high in sodium and calories &mdash; in a nutshell, they are not so good for health and contribute to a lot of health diseases (<a href="https://valleyinternational.net/index.php/ijmsci/article/view/3770" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>1</u></a>), (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146358/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>2</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, whether you are on a weight loss diet or not, it&rsquo;s always a good practice to limit the use of processed foods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LogaPritika Srinivasan&rsquo;s take on weight loss is commendable &mdash; she highlighted some simple tips that can help one burn calories and get a toned body easily.

Fitness Coach Reveals What You’re Doing Wrong!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-02/825040311_zodiac-sf.jpg"></img><p>She not only helped people know what mistake they might be making during their weight loss journey but also shared tips to help people make the right choices.</p>

<p>Below is what she asked her followers to do to accelerate the weight loss process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Ann Maria stated that instead of eating two eggs and a toast for breakfast, one should swap the toast with 3 slices of Kodiak waffles or pancakes. As these foods are high in carbs and protein, they will promote satiety. She further said that one can also prepare this beforehand and put it in the freezer.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Her second tip includes eating thawed crab meat instead of consuming chicken, salad, and yogurt all the time. As a great source of protein, it can also be included in salads for a relishing meal.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>According to Ann Maria, &ldquo;thaw crab meat&rdquo; can also be added to crackers or one can consume it as a snack to increase protein intake.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The fitness coach also emphasized filling half the plate with high-fullness index foods (fullness index of more than 200). High-fullness index foods are those that can keep you full for a long period.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Last but not least, the coach asked her followers to add bone broth to supper.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Ann Maria Tom, a dedicated fitness enthusiast, regularly shares her insights on social media, inspiring others to embrace a healthier lifestyle. Her diet tips highlight that weight loss is a holistic journey, achievable through small, sustainable lifestyle changes. By encouraging the inclusion of whole foods, protein-rich snacks, and regular workouts, she motivates people to transform into their healthiest selves.</p>

So, if a celebrity and their trainer are using external help, they know the consequences, and there will be ill effects on their health.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The celebrity trainer emphasized that staying fit and healthy does not require spending a whopping amount on fitness and workouts. One can opt for affordable, nutrient-rich foods, and commit to sustainable lifestyle choices. For renowned personalities, the stress and struggle that comes with fame and glamor is exorbitant. Hence, they invest in luxury gym memberships and exotic superfoods to stay in peak condition.</p>

<p>Yogesh Bhatega has been training top Bollywood celebrities for years. He recently spilled the beans and revealed fascinating aspects of the A-listers&rsquo; fitness regimes. They spend a staggering amount of their income on fitness to remain in peak condition, showcasing their determination to good health.

He also shared a list of common mistakes that can harm our health when it comes to drinking water:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Drinking one liter of water all at once can slow down digestion and cause bloating. Therefore, Anushka&rsquo;s trusted dietician suggests sipping water in 200 ml increments.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Another common mistake is standing and drinking water quickly. According to the nutritionist, consuming too much water while standing can disrupt your body&rsquo;s filtration process and overburden your kidneys. So, it&#39;s best to sit down and drink water.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Regularly consuming ice-cold water can slow down digestion. It&#39;s advisable to opt for lukewarm or room-temperature water instead.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, water is the solution to every problem. Maintaining proper hydration is crucial for overall health and well-being. As Anushka Sharma&rsquo;s dietician explains, simple tests can quickly reveal your body&rsquo;s hydration status. Listen to your body and adopt healthier drinking habits&mdash;staying hydrated is not only about quenching your thirst but also about enhancing your organ function. Prioritize drinking sufficient water to reap the benefits of optimal health and hygiene.</p>

According to Indya, staying hydrated has long-lasting effects on the body and mind. Not only does it make one&rsquo;s skin more radiant, but it also improves gut health and helps one feel more energized.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong>Meal Prep:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Indya puts so much emphasis on protein intake, she makes sure to do meal prep every couple of days. She prepares two types of protein and pops them in the fridge. This habit helps her save time and put together &ldquo;whatchagot&rdquo; meals anytime.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong>Track Your Habits:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>As someone with anxiety, Indya finds solace in putting her thoughts on paper. She made journaling a habit, and it has helped her practice gratitude and not lock up her thoughts. She also asks her followers to track their habits daily. Preparing to-do lists, tracking your progress, and listing stuff that has to be done can help one in the long run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indya regularly shares the deets on her weight loss journey and hopes it will help others the same way they helped her. She doesn&rsquo;t shy away from sharing about the surgical procedures she opted for. She opted for a tummy tuck, breast augmentation, and lift and body tight on her inner thighs and triceps, following her significant weight loss.

<p>Speculations around Kate Beckinsale&rsquo;s weight loss are proof that we often have no idea what&rsquo;s going on in our favorite celebrity&rsquo;s personal life. So it&rsquo;s better to keep our opinions to ourselves instead of jumping the gun. Kate&rsquo;s stand against trolls is brave and commendable. She stood her ground and called out mean commentators by naming their actions &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;insidious bullying.&rdquo; The fact that Kate had to address such a sensitive topic and personally ask fans to be considerate at the time of bereavement shows us the toxic side of celebrity culture.</p>

<p>The two-time Emmy award nominee has seen various highs and lows right from the initial days of her career.

Her diet is all about creating the right balance. She tries to eat healthy the majority of times but on cheat days, she enjoys cookies and pizza.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When she is training, she consumes more proteins. Moreover, she once acknowledged that she feels better by avoiding gluten, wheat, and dairy products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The American star eats lots of greens from her home garden and loves making salads with spinach, radishes, and other healthy options. Research shows that consuming vegetable-based salad is one effective way to increase nutrient intake and improve overall diet quality (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212267218320495" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>).</p>

<p>When she is at home for lunch, she runs out to the garden plucks some leaves, and throws together a quick salad with quinoa. Plus, she also relishes veggie burgers and gluten-free pretzels with almond cheese dip, which almost tastes like cream cheese.</p>

<p>Jessica Biel&rsquo;s workout routine and diet plan are worth seeking inspiration from if you want to maintain a sculpted figure. Her dedication to eating and staying healthy has yielded fruitful results.</p>

<p>The actress emphasizes the importance of feeling good from within. Her holistic approach to fitness can lead to a fulfilling life. As she continues to share her journey, she remains a role model for many who wish to enhance their well-being and discover personal strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maren Morris&#39;s weight loss journey has been shared publicly by her as well as her trainer, denying internet trolls the pleasure of making upsetting comments about her body. She has advocated for new moms and has addressed the need for them to feel proud of what they have accomplished. Be it her bold move of taking a step back from the country music scene or taking the decision of not showing her son&rsquo;s face to the public, Morris has been the talk of the town lately. But she denies to take these comments to heart and continues to live her life on her own terms.&nbsp;</p>

However, when she doesn&rsquo;t find time to squeeze in a workout, she doesn&rsquo;t beat herself up. She is lenient and pretty good at balancing diet with workouts.

His diet usually consists of a little fat and plenty of lean proteins and vegetables.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For breakfast, he enjoys eating a cheese omelet whereas his lunch includes chicken with a mix of vegetables like cauliflower, spinach, and broccoli cooked in olive oil. Research states that consumption of poultry meat along with a vegetable-rich diet is associated with a risk reduction of developing obesity and cardiovascular diseases (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4462824/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>12</u></a>).</p>

<p>During snack time, he prefers eating nuts and yogurt while sipping herbal energy drinks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, for dinner, he eats chicken or fish and leafy vegetables. Green leafy vegetables have excellent nutritional value as they contain dietary fibers, antioxidants, minerals, &alpha;-linoleic acid, and vitamins (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346008586_Health_Benefits_and_Therapeutic_importance_of_green_leafy_vegetables_GLVs" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>13</u></a>). On the other hand, when he is in the mood to cheat, he relishes pancakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>David Beckham&rsquo;s workout routine and healthy diet helped him build and maintain a swoon-worthy physique for years. It is indeed the result of his dedication, balanced approach, and perseverance. Right from embracing a range of physical activities to his commitment to eating wholesome food, he proves that it is not always about shortcuts and quick fixes but more about hard work and determination. To date, he shows his physical attributes to the world and continues to be the source of motivation.&nbsp;</p>

Christina Aguilera&rsquo;s weight loss was perceived negatively by many of her fans. As someone who has been in the public eye for so long, Christina has struggled with body image issues. But her method of dealing with trolls has evolved with time.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The way Christina Aguilera has dismissed the public&#39;s opinion about her body is refreshing to see. The singer hopes she has inspired her children to do the same. She struggled when she was younger and the negative comments about her body bothered her a lot. But she doesn&#39;t want her children to go through the same agony. 25 years into her career and she is still putting out enjoyable music for fans. She appears to be a lot happier and healthier and has decided to focus on her career and her family.</p>

Stefani works out at least four times a week, for 60-75 minutes per session. After all, a combination of nutrition and physical activity is the most promising when it comes to promoting healthy lifestyles and one&rsquo;s well-being (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10255595/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>). She visits the gym to stay fit and keep her abs toned. In an interview, the singer revealed that she always feels better when following a routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her former personal trainer, Mike Heatlie also mentioned that circuit training and high-intensity weight training with cardiovascular training is how she maintained her coveted physique.</p>

<p>Along with her husband, Blake, Gwen also carries out her exercises and plays tennis. They go to the gym together and she does squats, lunges, and light weights. Squats strengthen the muscles in the lower limbs whereas lunges are more effective at reducing body fat (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6050697/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>), (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9925109/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>9</u></a>).</p>

<p>Initially, she used to go crazy in the gym but lately, she just works out enough to make her body feel good. She hits the gym at least five days a week since it helps her feel the best of herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Publicly, she also disclosed that initially, she tried yoga and Pilates, but she opted for old-school fitness workouts like boxing.&nbsp; Yoga has been proven an effective method for improving health in addition to the prevention and management of diseases (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415184/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>). On the other hand, boxing is more efficient in developing physical fitness (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326307335_The_impact_of_a_boxing_training_program_on_physical_fitness_and_technical_performance_effectiveness" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>).</p>

<p>Reportedly, Gwen&rsquo;s personal trainer, Gunnar Peterson, also suggested considering rowing as a cardio exercise, in addition to hiking and outdoor physical activities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="67189e7f858d9"><strong>Gwen Stefani&rsquo;s Abs Workout&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>For Gwen, being consistent with working out helped her stay in shape and tone her abs. Additionally, she is quite active and spends nights dancing on stage in front of a live audience. In one of the interviews, she revealed that dancing on stage was more like preparing for a marathon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Gwen Stefani&rsquo;s Weight, Fitness, and Wellness Journey</strong></h2>

<p>The American personality also tries to keep her mental and physical health in check.&nbsp; Moreover, she has always prioritized working out and taking breaks whenever she felt her body needed it. Research states that there is a strong link between mental health and physical health, especially when one is aging (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617306639" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>12</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>After her split from Gavin Rossdale, her ex-husband in 2015, she focused on spiritual exercising to connect better and live more in the present. She also admitted that she struggled really hard to maintain her size 4 figure even before her pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking about her weight loss, one of the key components for her was staying hydrated, Hence, she drank lots of water and was always on a diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gwen Stefani&rsquo;s diet and urge to consume organic vegetarian food left fans stunned. In fact, she also confessed that she hates talking about her body. She doesn&rsquo;t want her body to define her. She manages to maintain her frame with good decisions and healthy food choices regarding her fitness and diet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the songwriter doesn&rsquo;t like to get caught in too much negativity and rumors. She maintains a healthy attitude towards negativity for the sake of her mental health. Last but not least, she urges everyone to find self-acceptance as it is never about how fat or thin you are, it is more about your mind and how you feel as a whole. Her toned figure which she claims to be an accident is purely because of her commitment toward her body.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to working out, and having a healthy and satisfying diet, Hudson finds self-care through getting fresh air from the great outdoors, practicing meditation, and maintaining an indulgent skincare routine. She also likes indulging in her favorite treats from time to time and sipping on her favorite cocktails.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">So there you have it. Everything mentioned above is a detailed account of Kate Hudson&rsquo;s workout, diet, and lifestyle. When it comes to physical activity, Hudson believes that movement is medicine and hence, keeps falling back on Pilates, strength exercises, hot yoga, and dance. Her healthy diet has a heavy emphasis on fiber-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables as well as high-quality lean proteins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hudson likes to kickstart her mornings with fluid cleanses, meditation, and rejuvenating face masks, which are all part of her self-care routine. Most importantly, the actress prioritizes being happy, gaining knowledge about healthier lifestyles, and having fun in everything she does, which is nothing short of inspiring.

<h2 id="6708ee123a7fa"><strong>Rob Lowe&rsquo;s Self-care Tips to Stay Healthy</strong></h2>

<p>For Rob Lowe, a healthy body and a happy heart can be achieved by being consistent with healthy lifestyle habits. According to him, it&rsquo;s not a particular diet, but a way of life that can help one nourish oneself from within. He is a spokesperson for the Atkins low-carb diet because he has been following it for years now and finds it quite sustainable and easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, he takes care of physical fitness, as it helps him relieve stress and calm his head. Adding to that, he focuses on having a good sleep, which further helps him stay fit.&nbsp; Good quality sleep not only calms one&rsquo;s mind but also improves physical health by improving heart health and promoting a healthy weight (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6281147/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Now that we have taken a look at Rob Lowe&rsquo;s diet, it&rsquo;s clear that the actor is determined to set some serious health and fitness goals for years to come. It&rsquo;s not just a mere diet or physical activity that has helped him defy aging &mdash; it&rsquo;s his holistic approach to his health that has paved the way for a healthy body and a happy mind. While we don&rsquo;t encourage going on an Atkins diet (high-protein, low-carb diet) without medical supervision, we do encourage following a healthy lifestyle plan consistently to improve your overall health.</p>

Eva revealed that she was &ldquo;depressed&rdquo; before, as well as through the divorce. She had also been &ldquo;trying to navigate and discover&rdquo; herself. She was in a dilemma whether to let herself go and look like how &ldquo;someone&rsquo;s mom&rdquo; should or take the &ldquo;top model&rdquo; away and lose her identity. The 40-year-old didn&rsquo;t opt for any weight loss drug like Ozempic, nor did she starve herself, trying to stay lean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eva&rsquo;s alteration wasn&rsquo;t intentional, and it disclosed the ugly side of celebrity culture once again. The public failed to show her any mercy and tore down her confidence by commenting negatively on her appearance. The star&rsquo;s weight loss wasn&rsquo;t intentional, and her health journey reminds us to be positive even when we are dealing with a traumatic life experience.</p>

This simple cardio exercise helps her energize and get a boost, especially in her morning workouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>High-intensity Cycling: </strong>In cardio, Beckham also engages in high-intensity cycling at the gym to give a boost to her thigh muscles and calves, while also maintaining a good posture.</p>

<h2 id="66ebe3641d15c" style="text-align:justify"><strong>Victoria Beckham&rsquo;s Journey with Health, Wellness, And Weight</strong></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the birth of her first child Brooklyn, Beckham&rsquo;s body was harshly criticized by the media. On the front page of a magazine, her postpartum body has arrows pointing at areas where she needed to lose weight. In an interview, she admitted that those things affected her deeply back in the time, which perhaps became the cause of her ultra-strict fitness regime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, she recently acknowledged how she has become more accepting of her appearance and more unapologetic. She seems to have found a balance between a disciplined lifestyle and having fun and knows what works for her.&nbsp; Today, Beckham is very happy about the fact that &ldquo;thinness is becoming old-fashioned&rdquo; and how people care about overall health and fitness more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Victoria Beckham&rsquo;s diet has been a topic of curiosity in the media for a very long time. She doesn&rsquo;t switch up the things she eats very often and sticks to her fish and veggies meals and avocado snacks most of the time. This is a nutritious choice of foods that Beckham has discovered works best for her, which is why she hasn&rsquo;t been keen on changing her diet in the past two decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This extreme decision to follow the same diet every day came after much scrutiny about her body, which made the Spice Girl make a commitment to herself. However, due to the lack of variety in her diet and the lopsided quantity of avocados she consumes, health experts and nutritionists aren&rsquo;t a fan of her diet. Hence, it is not a good idea to hop on the bandwagon if you&rsquo;re looking at losing weight, too.&nbsp;</p>

Research states that being fit or active is associated with a greater than 50% reduction in health-related risks (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1402378/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>10</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Tom suggests starting from a biomechanically neutral position that consists of knees over feet, hips over knees, shoulders over hips, and a firm core. However, if you are not in the correct alignment then you condition your body to be out of balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In one of the videos, Tom Brady&rsquo;s trainer, Alex Guerrero, laid stress upon starting an exercise in an athletic, neutral position by activating core muscles. During a set, when your muscles get exhausted, it is time to stop. According to Tom, when one&rsquo;s form breaks down, it is vital to bring the exercise to a halt.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">To start, Tom performs an active warm-up to stimulate his nervous system and get the blood flowing. For Tom, his trainer Alex uses three types of resistance bands &mdash; handle bands, long-looped resistance bands, and short-looped bands. Resistance training increases in skeletal muscle mass (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095254623000601" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>11</u></a>). In addition, a combination of strength and cardio delivers ground force production.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Tom Brady&rsquo;s diet plan and workout regime underscore the importance of living a healthier lifestyle. While he is committed to his TB12 diet even after retirement, he also acknowledges the importance of maintaining the right balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Overall, Tom Brady&#39;s diet method offers insights into making conscious and informed choices about food and lifestyle to support overall well-being and longevity. Additionally, his workout regime is also an intriguing topic for individuals looking to improve their own dietary habits and overall health.</p>

Despite being a mother of four and being tied down by a hectic schedule, Vanessa didn&rsquo;t want to let go of herself or compromise her health. However, it&rsquo;s not all smooth sailing. Her recent BTS photoshoot images for a well-known magazine have sparked Ozempic (or similar weight loss drugs) rumors, and fans have started to make assumptions that she opted for some weight loss surgery.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Fortunately, fans who have been dedicatedly following her fitness routine over the years are eyewitnesses to how much effort Williams puts into staying healthy and how her slim and toned physique is just a byproduct of the same. Her fans have even defended her amidst online trolls, outlining how several other reasons can act as catalysts for her weight loss other than any drug or surgery and how people shouldn&rsquo;t make nasty assumptions.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Besides, there is no evidence of Williams taking any shortcuts to weight loss, and the stories of her exercise routine and diet plan are all over her social media. The relentless trolling doesn&rsquo;t matter to Vanessa, as she&rsquo;s still killing it, both in her career and personal life!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Matthew Perry&rsquo;s weight loss was a direct result of his drug and alcohol abuse. The actor never really recovered and the health complications haunted him for years. Incredibly, Matthew&rsquo;s comic genius brought comfort to many of us, while he was struggling in his own life.&nbsp; Most of what we know about Matthew Perry&rsquo;s weight loss is that it was caused by the appetite suppression effects of drugs. However, there&rsquo;s little we know about his diet and exercise regime to get a better idea of his health and fitness levels. What&rsquo;s inspiring, though, is how the actor didn&rsquo;t give up on his battle with his addictions and stayed strong through his excruciating health journey.</p>

<p>Following his colon burst, Perry committed himself to dedicatedly healthy habits and managed to liberate himself from his addictions. If it wasn&#39;t for the misfortunes from his ketamine overdose, our beloved Chandler Bing would&rsquo;ve likely continued living a healthier life!</p>

She usually eats lunch at one or two, and for dinner too, she eats plenty of veggies and some protein-rich food.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Veggies provide us with plenty of nutrients that help keep various diseases at bay and boost our immunity (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649719/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>4</u></a>). Protein, on the other hand, is considered an essential muscle-building food, that not only helps improve muscle health but also increases energy levels, decreases fatigue, and improves satiety, thereby aiding in weight management (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566799/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>5</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>She Doesn&rsquo;t Refrain from Snacking</strong></h3>

<p>Snacks often have a negative connotation to them, however, snacking can be healthy if you do it right. Jennifer eats apples, popcorn, or almond butter as snacks in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She gives into her cravings as well and eats frozen yogurt topped with granola as a midnight snack. The <em>Love Happen</em>s star finds solace in eating Mexican food and often indulges in it on her cheat days.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>She Loves Eating Eggs</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Eggs are a staple food in Jennifer&rsquo;s diet and having avocado and eggs along with a shake is one of her favorite breakfast meals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eggs are a wonderful source of protein and keep us feeling full for a long period of time. Alongside, they contain vitamins too that build muscle, improve satiety,&nbsp; strengthen the immune system, and contribute to weight loss (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9316657/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>6</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>She Drinks Plenty of Water</strong></h3>

<p>Jennifer makes sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep herself hydrated. She candidly expressed that she drinks so much water that feels like it&rsquo;s &ldquo;comical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennifer Aniston takes every task seriously &mdash; be it acting, doing charitable work, or maintaining her fitness, she leaves no stone unturned in giving her all in everything. And this is the reason why she is one of the finest and fittest actors and is an inspiration to all who think as we age, we need our bodies to slow down.</p>

<p>At the age of 55, she is still burning calories and following a healthy meal plan as well as a consistent workout routine to stay in shape. For anyone embarking on a health and fitness journey, Jennifer Aniston&#39;s workout can prove to be highly motivating &ndash; so get inspired by her and become healthier and fitter!</p>

She took one step at a time. At first, she set a clear goal that she didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;wanna be fat anymore&rdquo; and embarked on a fitness journey. Then, she stayed patient and knew that progress, even &quot;in the smallest ways,&rdquo; matters. By making subtle changes to her diet, she managed to transform herself. Her weight loss story proves that eating healthily can definitely help us stay fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">What&rsquo;s commendable about that is unlike most people who lose oodles of weight, Rhimes did not seem pleased with the compliments about her weight loss that came her way. She stood strong in her opinion that losing weight doesn&rsquo;t make her a different person, and a person&rsquo;s weight and appearance shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for society to treat them differently and measure their value. Moreover, being a responsible and influential figure, Rhimes has never promoted any unhealthy or idealistic body standards for people and has always encouraged fans to be confident in who they are.</p>

She loves her ice cream, waffles, chocolates, gummies, etc., especially if they&rsquo;re sprinkled with some extra sprinkles and love. However, her favorite dessert of all would be a &ldquo;pizooki&rdquo; which is a chocolate chip cookie topped with vanilla ice cream.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Moreover, Sweeney loves snacking between meals, and one of her favorite snacks are peanut M&amp;Ms.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">To conclude, Sydney Sweeney&rsquo;s workout routine is so hardcore and intense that her occasional indulgence in treats doesn&rsquo;t come in the way of fitness at all. That being said, most Sweeney fans out there who don&rsquo;t follow such an extreme fitness lifestyle like hers should not partake in her food choices or sleep schedule on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For most people, a healthy lifestyle should comprise a simple mix of aerobic, cardiovascular, and strengthening exercises combined with breathwork and stretches (and regular recovery days). In addition, their diets should comprise well-balanced meals with proteins, complex carbs, healthy fats, and vegetables, limiting junk foods as much as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As Lawrence doesn&rsquo;t like to diet, she prefers going into her beast mode during workouts and usually exercises a lot more than an average person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was her preparation for the role of Mystique for <em>X-Men: First Class</em> that primed her exercise routine for the following years as well, under Wong&rsquo;s training. While we have discussed much of her workout habits above, the following is an overview of exercises that she typically engages in:</p>

<p><strong>Short HIIT Circuits:</strong> During the time she worked on the film, she would often incorporate regular bursts of HIIT circuits (15-minute-long) on the film&rsquo;s set. Lawrence doesn&rsquo;t feel the need to practice cardiovascular exercise separately as her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/fitness/emily-blunt-workout-1329798" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>HIIT workouts</u></a> incorporate many sprints and aerobic exercises to help increase her heart rate.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Weight Training:</strong> Joining the club of the best action actresses in Hollywood wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without practicing a great deal of weight training exercises. Besides, Lawrence is big on muscle strength and overall fitness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Posture Exercises:</strong> Wong&rsquo;s training laid the most emphasis on posture exercises, especially when J-Law was shooting for <em>Red Sparrow</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Yoga: </strong>Lawrence&#39;s exercises also incorporate a lot of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/fitness/benefits-of-vinyasa-yoga-1270512" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>yoga stretches</u></a> and breathwork to boost flexibility and enhance mind and body connection. She also practices diaphragmatic <em>ujjayi </em>breathing before bedtime &mdash; something Wong refers to as &lsquo;beditat-ing&rsquo; &mdash; to improve her lung health and sleep quality.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Pilates:</strong> To tone her body and improve coordination and core strength, Lawrence engaged in cross-training in the form of Pilates.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Jennifer Lawrence&rsquo;s weight loss began while filming <em>Red Sparrow, </em>where she portrayed the character of a former ballerina. Her journey is marked by compromises and patience. Instead of going on strict diets, she made minor changes in her daily routine, which resulted in her amazing transformation. She refuses to restrict herself from indulging in her favorite food items. Instead, she trains hard at the gym to make up for the excess calories.&nbsp;</p>

Over the years, he has made remarkable improvements in his health and physique without taking any shortcuts or using drugs such as Ozempic. Hence, his weight loss has been gradual but sustainable, and now, he looks better than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only concern about Matthews&rsquo; weight loss regime is that there is very little emphasis on exercising, which is also an important part of one&rsquo;s overall health and fitness. However, he does make it a priority to take long walks daily, which is an easy, practical, reasonable, and free-of-cost exercise physical activity for most people. Besides, considering that much of Matthews&rsquo; weight loss journey has been talked about on television or on his Instagram page, people have more transparency about it and can learn directly from his ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ross Mathews, through his weight loss journey, proves that with dedication and determination, anyone can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals, reminding us that change is within reach for all who dare to pursue it.</p>

<p>Drew Carey&rsquo;s weight loss is a testament to his unwavering commitment to a healthier lifestyle. Even after attaining his goal, Drew didn&rsquo;t dispose of his healthy habits. Looking at his transformation, we can derive how important it is to reduce the intake of excess carbohydrates in our diets and prioritize fruits, vegetables, yogurt, protein, and whole foods. For those who find it hard to part with carbohydrates, a good starting point is cutting back on fast food and packaged snacks&mdash;both of which were major culprits in Drew Carey&rsquo;s life as well. But he still rewards himself with a little treat every once in a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, Carey&rsquo;s routine highlights the importance of incorporating cardiovascular exercises into a fitness regimen for effective results. He greatly prioritized working out several times a week to lose weight. Drew Carey&rsquo;s physical transformation proves that to age gracefully without crippling health problems, such as diabetes and blood pressure, one should reconsider their diet and physical activity and improve it gradually.</p>

Bale has dropped a serious amount of weight for <em>The Machinist </em>and appears unwell. On the other hand, he is renowned for putting on a load of bulk to play <em>Batman</em>. In an interview, Christian shared that he ate a lot of pie for acing the role. However, one should restrict overeating sugary foods to minimize the risk of obesity (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9920526/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>8</u></a>).</p>

<p>After transforming into various characters for movies like <em>The Big Short </em>and <em>American Hustle</em>, Bale realized that he couldn&rsquo;t play with his weight so drastically all the time. It is not good, after all. Adding to that, he opened up stating that his morality kept staring at him right onto his face. No matter how many times he has shed pounds or gained some, his wife has seen it all. She has appreciated his role and dedication to give his best but is not someone who supports his actions when it comes to weight.</p>

<p>Christian Bale&rsquo;s weight loss for The Machinist is applaud-worthy. Known for extreme weight transformations for his roles, the actor&rsquo;s way of acing different characters is phenomenal. What makes him a stand-apart actor is his dedication and consistent persistence. His commitment to embodying every role demonstrates not only his talent but also his desire to push the boundaries of physical transformation. To date, the media and the public still marvel at his physique and look forward to what he will achieve in his upcoming roles.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In 2003, when Shaina went on a horse ride, she got bit by a tick and contracted Lyme disease. She revealed that she felt quite scared as she started feeling dizzy on stage and thought she&rsquo;d fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This unfortunate incident took a toll on her voice too. She feared that she would lose her melodious voice forever. After 6 or 7 years after the incident, her doctor found out that she had sustained nerve damage to her vocal cords, caused by the disease.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">She underwent open-throat vocal cord surgeries and took the help of a therapist to get her voice back.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For the unversed, Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Its symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3652387/" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><u>7</u></a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shania Twain&rsquo;s weight loss journey wasn&rsquo;t a cakewalk. She focused on dietary changes and working out and even adopted a holistic approach to lead a healthier life. Her journey has undoubtedly motivated a lot of people to switch to healthier foods and lose weight without opting for surgeries or expensive weight-loss drugs. She proved that achieving weight loss goals without extreme measures is not only possible but also satisfying.</p>

Pushing Too Much Too Soon</strong></h3>

<p>This is a common mistake that people make with not just the cobbler&rsquo;s pose but with any yoga asana for that matter. Flexibility is a faculty that can be achieved only with consistent practice, not in a single go! Hence, pushing your body too much in the practice, especially when it is not used to this form of movement can have more negative effects than positive, and risk aches and injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2. Not Using Blocks for Support, If Needed</strong></h3>

<p>Yoga blocks are essential tools to facilitate movement in an intermediate practice, such as the cobbler&rsquo;s pose, especially when you are new to it. They help muffle the impact that your body is not prepared to endure all by itself. Hence, when your knees can&rsquo;t get perfectly flat on the mat, it is a good idea to place two blocks under them to support the movement. If you don&rsquo;t have blocks, you can use substitutes such as firm bolsters.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>3. Holding the Breath for Too Long</strong></h3>

<p>Often, beginner yoga practitioners confuse deepening the breath with holding the breath for too long. However, doing so may end up choking you, thereby not only disrupting the practice but also posing severe health risks. To get an idea of how long is too long when it comes to holding your breath, align your breath cycle with the back-and-forth movement of the bound-angle pose, assuming you&rsquo;re practicing that variant. If practicing the static cobbler&rsquo;s pose, you can simply breathe naturally.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>4. Not Keeping the Back Straight</strong></h3>

<p>By rounding the back too much in this seated position, you would be straining your muscles too much or putting your front body in a position that collapses forward, leading to injuries. Besides, rounding the back counters the benefits of practicing this pose, which is improving the posture.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>5. Practicing with a Knee/Groin Injury</strong></h3>

<p>This pose comprises stretching the inner thigh muscles and groin muscles, as well as bending of the knees, which inevitably puts pressure on those parts of the body. Hence, one should avoid practicing this pose when they have any injury in those regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Like every hip-opening yoga pose, <em>baddha konasana</em> too offers the body a rejuvenating experience that comprises an exhilarating release and enhanced mood. The pose is grounding and challenging at the same time, and its practice has very few risks involved if done correctly. Another feature that sets this pose apart from the rest is that it fits a sweat-jerking <em>hatha </em>yoga sequence as well as a gentle and calming yin yoga practice. With regular and consistent practice, you will see a dramatic change in how much the range of motion, of your body has increased. Ensure that you don&rsquo;t go overboard with this exercise in the first try itself, and respect your body while practicing this asana.</p>
