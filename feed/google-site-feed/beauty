It is common to prepare a besan and turmeric ubtan, and many have grown up using it for tan. Ubtan was the only known way to fight sun damage for a long time.</p>

<p>However, with increasing pollution in urban areas, your skin is exposed to additional impurities, along with heat. Hence, a modern <a href="https://foxtale.in/products/skin-radiance-mask">tan removal face mask</a> and a <a href="https://foxtale.in/products/super-glow-face-wash">detan face wash</a> are just the solution you need to prevent modern skin problems.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s understand the details of <strong>traditional ubtan vs new age ubtan</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="69942e17d6fc9">What is Traditional Ubtan? Benefits and&nbsp;limitations</h2>

<p>Traditional ubtan is India&rsquo;s original glow-up kit. A mix of besan (gram flour), turmeric, sandalwood, and a splash of milk or rose water is a trusted recipe for generations. It is natural, cooling, and offers a gentle way to scrub away the day.</p>

<p>However, ubtan also has its downsides. You prepare it yourself so that the results can be hit-or-miss. The coarse gram flour may be too grainy for some, causing redness or irritation.</p>

<h2 id="69942e17d6fd7">New Age Ubtan vs Traditional Ubtan</h2>

<p>New Age ubtans are different. Think of it as the traditional recipe, but refined in a lab. The old-school version relies on raw kitchen ingredients, but new-age ubtans are clay-based masks that carry the same spirit but with precision.</p>

<p>New-age ubtan uses high-quality clays like Kaolin clay and stabilised ingredients, such as Niacinamide or Vitamin C. The biggest difference? You do not have to scrub your face raw. A modern tan-removal and de-tan face mask can outperform a DIY bowl.</p>

<h2 id="69942e17d6fdf">Clay Masks: The Modern Answer to Tan Removal</h2>

<p>Clay masks have become the go-to for city dwellers because they do more than just surface-level cleaning. Ubtan mostly works on the surface, but clays like Kaolin or Bentonite act like a vacuum for your pores. They pull out the pollution, sweat, and oil that build up under the sun deep within your skin.</p>

<p>A modern tan-removal mask for the face is formulated to be gentle. It provides controlled exfoliation that removes dead skin cells without stripping your natural oils.</p>

<h2 id="69942e17d6fe4">Why Foxtale Skin Radiance Mask Stands Out as a De-Tan Face Mask</h2>

<p>The Tan removal face mask is a standout choice if you are ready to try the new-age ubtan approach. It is designed to give you an instant, fresh-from-the-salon glow without the hassle of a multi-step facial.</p>

<p>This de-tan face mask is a favourite for its creamy, non-drying formula. Most people expect clay masks to crack and feel tight, but this one stays comfortable on the skin. It is a tan-removal and de-tan face mask for all skin types that helps improve sun damage and dullness.</p>

<h2 id="69942e17d6fe8">Tan Removal Solutions by Skin Type: What Works Best?</h2>

<p>Not all skin reacts to the sun (or masks) the same way. Here&rsquo;s how you can make a safe choice.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>For Oily Skin:</strong> Sun exposure can increase oiliness. A <strong>tan removal face mask for oily skin</strong> uses clay to absorb excess sebum while clearing the tan.</li>
	<li><strong>For Dry Skin:</strong> Traditional ubtan can leave dry skin feeling tight. A <strong>tan removal face mask for dry skin</strong> contains hydrating ingredients, making them a safer option for removing tan from dry skin.</li>
	<li><strong>For Sensitive Skin:</strong> The grains in DIY ubtan can be too abrasive. A <strong>tan removal face mask for sensitive skin</strong> offers a soothing option.</li>
	<li><strong>For Combination Skin:</strong> You need a <strong>tan removal and de-tan face mask for all skin types</strong> that treats your oily T-zone and dry cheeks equally well. Clay masks are perfect for this balance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="69942e17d6fec">Daily Tan Control Starts With the Right Cleanser</h2>

<p>A weekly mask is a great treat, but you cannot ignore the other six days of the week. <strong>Tan removal mask for face</strong> works best when it is part of a daily habit. This is why a daily detan face wash is so important.</p>

<p>A brightening cleanser removes daily buildup from sun damage, so use it every day. Your face wash is like daily maintenance to keep the glow alive, while your clay mask is the deep-clean that hits the reset button on your skin once a week.</p>

<h2>Traditional or Modern: Which One Should You Choose?</h2>

<p>Traditional ubtan is a beautiful ritual, but it does not always have the strength or the convenience we need today. Modern clay masks offer a more reliable way to see results.</p>

<p>A routine that actually holds up in 2026 is mentioned below.</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Daily:</strong> Use a gentle detan face wash to keep your skin fresh.</li>
	<li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Spend 15 minutes with a high-quality de-tan face mask to clear away stubborn tanning.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Final Takeaway: The Better Choice for Your Skin</h2>

<p>New-age ubtan clay masks are the clear winner for faster, cleaner, and more consistent results. They take the best parts of Indian tradition and adapt them to modern skin that faces 2026 levels of sun and pollution. You can make your glow last longer by choosing a mask designed for Indian skin.</p>

Nutritionist Shikha Singh points out that chronic inflammation is often a silent barrier to weight loss. When we are stressed, sleep-deprived, or eating too much sugar, the body releases chemicals called cytokines. Shikha describes these as &lsquo;noise&rsquo; that messes with our internal signals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your diet has a lot of processed food, sugar and alcohol, or if you smoke, are under stress, or you do not get enough sleep and have a hormonal imbalance, your body may have inflammation,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Your body may release an inflammatory chemical called cytokines, which disrupts the functioning of insulin and leptin, which are related to managing sugar and hunger. Such disruptions can lead to more fat storage in the body and drastic weight gain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To truly embrace this lifestyle, experts like Simrun Chopra, founder of Nourish with Sim, suggest a serious pantry audit. The goal is to remove &lsquo;trigger&rsquo; foods that keep the body in a state of high alert.</p>

<p>By clearing out these inflammatory triggers, the body stops fighting itself, allowing hormones to balance out and weight to drop naturally&mdash;just as it did for Aamir.</p>

<p>Yet another simple technique to get your skin makeup ready is to ice it with the help of a roller. If you don&rsquo;t want to spend a penny, then you can simply take an ice cube from your refrigerator and roll it over your face. This will not only open your pores but also reduce puffiness, calm inflammation and help increase the absorption of other product formulas, making for an effective remedy.</p>

<h2 id="68c293e437ce9"><strong>Massaging Your Face</strong></h2>

<p>Massaging your face may sound very basic, but it is actually quite beneficial. Either use a jade roller or just your fingers, but gently massaging your face before applying makeup will help your facial muscles relax, reduce redness and help boost blood circulation. It gives your skin a gentle, short-term lift, which is perfect before applying your makeup.</p>

<h2 id="68c293e437cec"><strong>Kareena Kapoor&rsquo;s work front</strong></h2>

<p>Kareena Kapoor was last seen in Singham Again alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/ajay-devgn-upcoming-movies-1363214" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline">Ajay Devgn</a>, Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor and more. Regarding her next project, Pinkvilla exclusively shared last year that she has signed one of the biggest and most exciting feature films of Indian cinema. The source also told us that it is set to release in 2026.</p>

From raw ginger shots to nighttime routines, here’s her secret]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-08/970688515_image-1280x720-13.webp"></img><p>Priyanka Chopra&rsquo;s glass glowing skin is to swoon over. The actress is one in the industry who has had a holistic approach to wellness and skincare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having stepped into the movies at an early age, Chopra has managed to maintain a healthy and glamorous appearance over the years while also inspiring her fans to keep themselves fit at all times.</p>

<p>The Matrix actress has often talked about different practices and has shared her homemade remedies for clear skin and a healthier digestive system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an interaction with her fans on social media, the actress presented them with a tip of rubbing raw garlic on feet to reduce inflammation. In the clip, she laughed and went on to say, &ldquo;The raw garlic thing really had a moment, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="68ccfe49bb94d"><strong>Priyanka Chopra&rsquo;s daily routine for a glowing skin</strong></h2>

<p>The White Tiger star relies on age-old remedies provided by her mother and grandmother, which have worked wonders for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For that visible glow on the face, the actress mixed rice water and coconut oil to make a homemade mask, which helps in shrinking the pores and tightening the skin. The mask can be applied every day for a few minutes before bed. Additionally, Chopra is very particular about following her six-step routine while also visiting her facialist regularly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress has also got hacks for some common ailments. Priyanka gave a peek into her 3-ingredient drink.<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/priyanka-chopra-rings-in-43rd-birthday-with-greatest-gifts-husband-nick-jonas-and-daughter-malti-marie-pics-1393985"> The Dostana star</a> mixed powdered fennel, cumin seed, and coriander with water, which could bring down the acidity and give a healthier gut.</p>

<p>Chopra also weighed in on her healthy shots, which include raw ginger and a spoonful of honey, revealing that it is a brilliant cure for sore throats. She added that the drink with all organic ingredients also boosts the immune system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Practicing Priyanka Chopra&rsquo;s daily routine would not only bring a glow to the skin but also purify the blood and is healthy all the way.</p>

<p>Amid flaunting her gorgeous skin at the event and on her social media account, the actress shared a variety of products she used, which some of her fans believed to be quite expensive.

<p>As for the fourth step, Gomez applied a toner, gently tapping it in with a makeup pad. The next step includes a facial oil, which she went on to massage across her face before applying some moisturizer.&nbsp;</p>

Almost 90 per cent of people deal with it and are on a constant quest to find a perfect hack to deal with it. Although there are an infinite number of tips and tricks that people follow, today we have a unique routine straight from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-tamannaah-bhatia-vijay-varma-call-it-quits-after-years-of-dating-details-inside-1375691">Tamannaah Bhatia</a>&rsquo;s beauty regimen. She uses her own spit to deal with pimples and claims it is effective.</p>

<h2 id="68904074c030d"><strong>Tamannaah Bhatia&rsquo;s spit hack</strong></h2>

<p>In a recent interview with Lallantop, Tamannaah Bhatia was asked the secret behind her clear skin and the hack she uses to deal with pimples. She instantly replied, &ldquo;Spit (thook)&rdquo;. This left everyone speechless, to which she said, &ldquo;ya, the silence&rdquo;. The interviewer immediately jokes, &ldquo;Yeh reel viral hone wali hai.&rdquo; (This reel is going to get viral). The actress further added, &ldquo;It works, but the morning spit, which is before brushing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Explaining the hack, the Entertainment star explained that it is scientific. When you wake up in the morning, there is enough antibacterial. She suddenly paused and clarified that she is not a doctor, but this is what she understands of the science, and that it is her personal hack, and she believes there is a science to it. Bhatia revealed that your body creates a lot of antibacterial elements in the mouth in the morning.</p>

<p>She further added that this is why our eyes are full of mucus, our nose is full of mucus, and our mouth is battling all the bacteria which has accumulated in the night before brushing our teeth. Bhatia concluded, &ldquo;If you use this spit, it will immediately dry up your pimples, if it&#39;s not cystic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earlier in a conversation with Vogue India, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/skincare/tamannaah-bhatias-diy-face-masks-for-glowing-healthy-skin-1390003">Tamannaah shared that her skincare routine</a> has always been influenced by her mother&rsquo;s advice.

The actress recently welcomed a daughter with Sidharth Malhotra. While her work, personal life, and social media activities often grab our interest, her beauty is something that leaves us speechless. Kiara has flawless skin, and there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. But do you know how she maintains her glowing, clear skin? Here&rsquo;s what you should know.</p>

<h2 id="688e094ec6183"><strong>Kiara Advani talks about her homemade quick DIY facemask</strong></h2>

<p>At the launch of Tira Beauty&#39;s store in Jio World Plaza, Mumbai, in 2024, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/sidharth-malhotra-and-kiara-advani-welcome-baby-girl-1393807">Kiara Advani</a> revealed her beauty secrets while speaking to Vogue India. She emphasized that nothing gives a glow quite like the natural ingredients found in her kitchen. She mentioned that she has been using her grandmother&#39;s face mask recipe for years and shared that, regardless of your skin concerns, DIY face masks made with fruits and vegetables are the simplest way to achieve clearer, more radiant skin.</p>

<p><strong>Here is Kiara Advani&#39;s 3-step DIY facemask:</strong></p>

<p>1. Take gram flour (besan) as needed.<br />
2. Add a little milk or malai (fresh cream).<br />
3. Add a little honey.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/war-2-new-song-aavan-jaavan-twitter-review-are-fans-liking-hrithik-roshan-and-kiara-advanis-sizzling-chemistry-1394841">War 2</a> actress mixes all these ingredients into a smooth paste and applies it to her face. She had stated, &quot;I think it is the best detox face mask that my grandma passed down to me; but also, any fruit or vegetable that you are eating, once you are done, the peels of that are just perfect for your skin. So, whatever you eat, you can just put a little bit of it (on your face) and it always works.&quot;</p>

<h2 id="688e094ec6197"><strong>More about her skincare routine</strong></h2>

<p>Kiara Advani was asked about her secret to always having fresh skin. She revealed how she maintains her skin in her 30s. She ensures that she removes all her makeup to prevent any residue on her face. She follows a basic routine of applying moisturizer and sunblock.</p>

This chia seed drink is what you need in your life]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-07/1099597132_mrunal.webp"></img><p><strong>Mrunal Thakur uses papaya mask, honey scrub for her skin</strong></p>

<p>In an old interview with Tweak India, Mrunal revealed that she has dry skin.

She also prefers to use DIY face masks and scrubs for her skin.</p>

<p>Every Sunday, she applies a papaya mask and honey or sugar scrub on her face. While honey has antibacterial properties, brown sugar gently removes dead skin cells. Mrunal also applies aloe vera by gently rubbing it on her skin. She gets the leaf directly from the plant and takes out the gel to use it on her face.</p>

<h3><strong>Why are chia seeds beneficial?</strong></h3>

<p>Chia seeds have omega-3 fatty acids and are rich in antioxidants, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They are great for skin and digestion. The seeds hydrate your skin and improve its elasticity. Chia seeds can also help with issues like acne and redness. They improve digestion and detoxify your body.</p>

<p>Wondering how the diva maintains such healthy and radiant skin so effortlessly? Here&rsquo;s when she revealed her trusted beauty hacks that you can easily follow as well.</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor does not compromise on hydration&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The key to good and healthy skin is hydration, and Shraddha Kapoor adheres to it. During one of her previous interviews with Zoom, the actress had opened up about how she makes it a point to stay hydrated all the time.</p>

<p>Besides regular water, the starlet emphasized consuming coconut water at least once a day. It is known for its antioxidant properties, which keep the skin nourished, reduce signs of aging, fight acne, and improve skin texture.</p>

<p>Shraddha said, &ldquo;I drink a lot of water in a day, accompanied by coconut juice at least once a day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor focuses on eating clean&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides fluids, Shraddha Kapoor also keeps a close watch on her food intake and diet patterns. The actress, known for maintaining a healthy appetite, highlighted that she tends to avoid junk food and opt for cleaner eating habits.</p>

<p>She also mentioned attempting to incorporate vegan options into her diet, which leads to a natural glow on her face. In her words, &ldquo;In terms of food, I avoid eating junk and since I am trying to go vegan, I eat very healthy, which reflects a special glow on the face.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor&rsquo;s strict rule against taking makeup to bed</strong></p>

<p>Another most important highlight of Shraddha&rsquo;s makeup hack is certainly surrounding makeup. The actress emphasizes never wearing makeup to bed and duly removes it before going to sleep.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/will-aditya-roy-kapur-shraddha-kapoor-reunite-with-mohit-suri-for-aashiqui-3-director-says-burden-mere-sar-pe-1393822">Stree 2</a> star also ensures that she applies sunscreen generously whenever she steps out of her house during the daytime.

<p><strong>Cleanse: </strong>Use a gentle, soap-free, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free cleanser that doesn&rsquo;t irritate the skin and is dermatologically tested. Look for brightening ingredients like Vitamin E, Niacinamide, and Sea Daffodil.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Treat:</strong> Follow your dermatologist&rsquo;s guidance for treating sensitive skin and related concerns like acne or pigmentation. Choose clinically tested products specifically formulated for sensitive skin. Serums with ingredients like Advanced Peptide, Vitamin C, Sea daffodils, Niacinamide can effectively target the dark spots and uneven skin tones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Opt for moisturizers that reinforce the skin barrier, Hydrate, Soothe, and protect against irritation, provide relief from itching, redness, and discomfort. Look for ingredients such as Niacinamide, Panthenol, and Glycerin, which help calm inflammation and support skin repair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Protect:</strong> Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen. Mineral or hybrid sunscreens are ideal for sensitive skin types.&nbsp;</p>

No matter how controversial we may think their stance is, no one can deny that they have redefined the beauty standards for a whole generation by popularizing the hourglass figure and fuller lips. Kylie Jenner had previously broken her years-long silence on getting work done and revealed getting breast enhancement before giving birth to her daughter. Not long after that, she also revealed specific details regarding her surgery, disclosing the size, profile, and place of her breast implants and even the name of her surgeon, Garth Fisher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears that her bold statement has inspired her sister Khloe to divulge the details of her cosmetic procedures. After Dr. Jonny Betteridge, a London-based doctor, deciphered her cosmetic procedures following her recent appearance at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez&rsquo;s wedding, she came clean about all the times she opted for a nip and tuck.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Jonny Betteridge Lists Khloe Kardashian&rsquo;s Various Plastic Surgeries&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Betteridge is a London-based doctor and is the founder of JB Clinics, a renowned skin care facility. He became famous among beauty enthusiasts by decoding the cosmetic procedures attempted by big-name celebrities. Recently, he offered his insights into Khloe Kardashian&rsquo;s aesthetic procedures. Keeping his tone respectful and formal, he cataloged various surgeries Khloe may have opted for. Here&rsquo;s what he revealed.</p>

<p>Firstly, he lauded Khloe for standing out with her all-pink ensemble at Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s wedding. Khloe, who recently turned 41, looks stunningly different from her younger years. Dr. Jonny points out that the influencer has noticeably lost weight over the years, which contributed to her changed appearance. However, plastic surgery has also played a big role in her looking so different. According to the doctor, these procedures include both surgical and non-surgical interventions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He believes that Khloe has gotten a temporary brow lift. The surgical procedure is slightly different from a full brow lift and focuses on lifting the outer corners of the eyebrows to give the face a more chiselled and youthful appearance. Khloe may have also opted for an upper blepharoplasty. She may have had Botox injected into her forehead to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles. When you take a close look at her nose, the raised tip and sharp nose bridge point toward a rhinoplasty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Dr. Jonny, Khloe has had both a lip lift done and fillers injected into her lips to give them a voluptuous look. She has also gotten a chin implant to attain a sharper jawline. Jonny thinks she may have gotten a facelift and neck lift done, as evident from looking at her earlobes, as they are tucked behind her jaw.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The post went viral in no time, and Khloe also took notice. She commented under the post, sportingly revealing that she has lost over 80 pounds over the years. She also listed down all the times she went under the knife and the names of her doctors. The Kardashian&nbsp;star revealed getting a nose job, laser hair, soft wave laser for skin, fillers, collagen, baby threads under her chin and neck, regular facials, and other skin treatments done that range from salmon sperm facials to peptides.&nbsp;</p>

They have wisely swapped them up with the right virtues that one holds within. Priyanka, India&#39;s desi girl, has made her mark in both Bollywood and Hollywood, inspiring millions around the world.&nbsp;The Miss World 2000 has truly broken cultural and industry barriers and continues to stand as a testament to resilience and perseverance for many.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, the most-loved Deepika Padukone goes a step beyond and acquaints her audience with the true beauty that lies within. Not only does her acting prowess speak for itself, but&nbsp;<span style="box-sizing:border-box; margin:0px; padding:0px">her ethos surrounding makeup,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/5-bizarre-and-unusual-beauty-hacks-by-b-town-divas-alia-bhatt-priyanka-chopra-and-katrina-kaif-1388093" target="_blank">beauty, skincare</a>, and mental health also&nbsp;</span>reflects her outlook on life. Here&rsquo;s what the two beauties have to say about all things beauty standards.</p>

<p><strong>Learn What Beauty Is According to Priyanka Chopra And Deepika Padukone</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/priyanka-chopras-body-language-changed-after-moving-to-hollywood-listen-to-what-this-famous-psychotherapist-has-to-say-1391403">Priyanka Chopra Jonas</a> has carved her path of success, right from winning the title of Miss World 2000 to becoming an accomplished actress, producer, and philanthropist. Over the years, she has learned a lot about beauty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one of the interviews, she candidly stated, &ldquo;If you are happy, you will look your most beautiful.&rdquo; Hence, she always strives for happiness to look her best version of beauty. Chopra emphasizes that women from all backgrounds should prioritize themselves, highlighting the benefits of dedicating a few minutes to self-care. The life of a beauty pageant and actress indeed comes with a set of pressures and challenges, but what goes a long way is true happiness.</p>

<p>One beauty advice the Dostana<em> </em>actress ever received was to double cleanse her face before going to bed. The process helps take off every ounce of makeup, pollutants, and impurities clinging to the skin. The 42-year-old actress is incredibly grateful to have adhered to the advice since her 20s and 30s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deepika Padukone embodies resilience and determination. She has always been open about her personal struggles with mental health and beauty. For her, true beauty lies in the ability to express oneself authentically. In one of the public discussions, she stated that a person is considered beautiful when they feel centered, confident, and healthy, both physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>For the Happy New Year alum, rather than makeup, personality speaks a lot about beauty. The true definition lies within what one radiates, feels, and embraces about oneself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be it Priyanka or Deepika, the influential personalities hit the right spot, influencing countless individuals across borders. They have not only broken societal stigmas and burst beauty myths, but also dealt with the pressures of real life.&nbsp;</p>

But here&rsquo;s the thing: retinol is potent, and your skin needs time to adjust. At first, you might notice some dryness, redness, or flaking. That&rsquo;s your skin&rsquo;s way of adapting to the faster renewal process. Starting slow and using a hydrating moisturizer alongside retinol can help ease this transition.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t skip sunscreen. Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to UV rays, so applying a broad-spectrum SPF every morning is a must to protect your investment and prevent further damage.</p>

<p><strong>Take Away: Why Retinol Deserves a Spot in Your Routine</strong></p>

<p>Retinol is a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/skincare/avneet-kaurs-skincare-routine-with-moisturizer-as-key-element-for-glass-skin-1390143">skincare</a> hero because it works on multiple levels: speeding up cell turnover, increasing collagen, evening out dark spots, and supporting skin repair. Its chemistry-driven effects take time but can transform your skin&rsquo;s texture, tone, and overall youthful glow.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to retinol, start with a gentle formulation like <a href="https://www.olayskincare.com/en-in/skin-care-products/retinol24-night-serum-with-retinol-and-vitamin-b3/">Olay Regenerist Retinol24 Night Serum</a> or <a href="https://www.olayskincare.com/en-in/skin-care-products/retinol24-night-moisturiser-with-retinol-and-vitamin-b3/">Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Face Cream</a>. These products contain retinyl propionate, a milder and more stable form of retinol, along with a hydrating complex that helps minimize dryness. The formula works overnight to smooth and even out skin tone, and many users report visible improvements in fine lines and wrinkles within just 28 days. It&rsquo;s also free from artificial dyes, fragrances, and oils, making it suitable for daily use.</p>

<p>To learn more, consult a dermatologist. With patience, protection, and consistency, retinol can be an effective part of your skincare routine for years to come.</p>

<p>Deepika is always open to trying new styles. &ldquo;She never says no unless she wears something and it turns out to be a disaster,&rdquo; Shaleena shared. That&rsquo;s when they all agree to drop the look.</p>

<p>When it comes to fashion and beauty,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/suniel-shetty-is-the-modern-and-coolest-nana-to-athiya-shetty-kl-rahuls-daughter-evaarah-and-his-workout-plans-say-it-all-1389383">Evaarah</a>&rsquo;s mommy picks comfort. Her skin and style routine reflect that simple, natural approach.</p>

<p><strong>Athiya&rsquo;s fashion choices</strong></p>

<p>Her fashion sense is rooted in comfort, with a touch of effortless chic. She believes fashion should be fun and reflect your personality. &quot;It&rsquo;s all about how you feel in what you wear,&rdquo; she says, emphasizing that confidence is key to carrying any look well.</p>

<p>Her everyday go-to outfit is a pair of hoodie tracks. Simple, cozy, and perfect for a quick step out. She also loves adding accessories to complete her look. A chunky bracelet and a wristwatch are her staples, and she would never want to leave her home without them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about her preference between heels and flats, she chose flats without hesitation. On special occasions, she keeps it classic with a well-fitted pair of jeans and a white tee or a sleek black cocktail dress.</p>

<p>She also follows fashion advice from her mother, trusting her instinct and experience. For her, style isn&rsquo;t about trends but about expressing how you feel.</p>

<p>Athiya Shetty proves that you don&rsquo;t need a dozen products to achieve great skin. A bit of hydration, a gentle skincare routine, and sticking to what works &mdash; that&rsquo;s her real secret.</p>

<p>Next, she creates a mask using curd (which she swears by for its moisturizing properties), honey, and mashed seasonal fruit&mdash;in this case, banana. She mixes them well and applies the paste generously on her face.</p>

<p>While sharing this routine, Janhvi Kapoor recalled a fun memory with her sister, Khushi Kapoor. During one of their vacations, their bathroom turned into a fruity mess, filled with leftovers from their skin experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Orange for brightening</strong></p>

<p>Once the mask is washed off with water, Janhvi takes half of a fresh orange, squeezes some juice out, and gently rubs the orange on her cheeks and face. She says this helps with removing tan and adds a brightening effect to the skin.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Relaxing with almond oil</strong></p>

<p>After letting the orange juice sit for a few minutes, she rinses her face again and takes a small amount of almond oil. Using just her fingers, she gently pats it under her eyes. Janhvi finds this step extremely relaxing and soothing, especially after long shoots or meetings.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Sun protection is a must</strong></p>

<p>To finish the routine, she applies a good sunscreen to lock in the care and protect her skin before heading out.</p>

<p>This DIY routine is not only easy to follow but also connects Janhvi to cherished memories with her mom, Sridevi, who was known for her timeless beauty and shared several natural skincare tips with her daughter.</p>

<p>Kriti then applies a serum packed with skin-loving ingredients. Her serum contains hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, alpha arbutin, Kakadu&nbsp;plum extract, and aloe vera extract.</p>

<p><strong>Sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>Kriti does not prefer using a separate moisturiser followed by sunscreen. Instead, she uses a sunscreen that also works as a moisturiser. This helps her simplify the routine without compromising on protection. She advises using a generous amount of sunscreen and applying it thoroughly to the face, neck, and even eyelids. Kriti emphasised the importance of sunscreen, stating that 80 to 90 percent of premature ageing is caused by sun damage, making it essential to wear sunscreen whether indoors or outdoors.</p>

<p><strong>Lip balm</strong></p>

<p>To wrap up her morning routine, she&nbsp;applies a hydrating and glossy lip balm. The diva&nbsp;mentioned that she always carries her lip balm wherever she goes, ensuring her lips stay nourished throughout the day.</p>

<p><strong>Kriti also takes care of these simple steps while following her morning skincare routine:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Follow product thickness: </strong><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-kriti-sanon-admits-feeling-frustrated-with-limited-opportunities-i-wanted-something-deeper-1293086">Kriti Sanon</a> recommends applying skincare products in the order of thickness&mdash;start with watery or water-based products and layer the thicker ones later. She also mentioned that face oils should always go last because no product can penetrate through oil.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t skip the neck and chest:</strong> She highlights that your skincare routine should not be limited to the face. She suggests applying products to the neck and a bit on the chest area too.</p>

<p><strong>Be mindful in the morning:</strong> Kriti avoids using any products that may make the skin sensitive to sunlight, especially in the morning when she&rsquo;s most exposed to the sun, pollution, and harsh lighting. She believes morning skincare should be light and simple, especially if makeup will be applied later.</p>

Known for her glowing skin and healthy hair, Shraddha shared how she maintains her beauty from the inside out and the self-care practices she never skips.</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor&#39;s daily wellness rituals</strong></p>

<p>In a conversation with NDTV, when asked about her daily wellness and beauty rituals, Kapoor emphasized the importance of staying hydrated. For her, hydration is a life mantra that she follows consistently every day. Along with drinking plenty of water, she believes in keeping her skincare routine minimal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using only one or two products on her skin, she relies on the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; philosophy. Regular exercise also plays a crucial role in her overall self-care routine, supporting both her physical and mental health.</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor&#39;s beauty philosophy</strong></p>

<p>Shraddha believes that true beauty stems from inner well-being. She highlights the importance of staying positive and taking care of both her mind and body.</p>

<p>According to her, external beauty treatments and products can only do little. Maintaining a balanced internal state is what helps her look and feel her best. For Shraddha, mental peace and emotional wellness are just as important as any skincare product.</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor prioritizes self-care&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Despite her packed routine, Shraddha&nbsp;prioritizes self-care. She shared that having a hectic lifestyle makes it even more essential to take time out for oneself. Every night before bed, she reserves an hour just for herself.</p>

<p>During this time, she indulges in activities that help her relax and unwind. Whether it&rsquo;s reading a book, listening to music, meditating, or spending time with her dog and family, this hour is a daily ritual she cherishes and looks forward to.</p>

<p><strong>Shraddha Kapoor&#39;s secrets for healthy hair</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/fitness/shraddha-kapoor-swears-by-her-skincare-secret-and-its-drinking-water-heres-why-you-should-too-1388043">Shraddha Kapoor</a>&rsquo;s beautiful, healthy hair is no accident. She follows a consistent routine that includes trimming her hair every six to eight weeks to avoid split ends. Oiling every alternate week is another essential step in her routine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She prefers to keep her hair product use to a minimum and avoids exposing them&nbsp;to excessive heat during styling. These practices help her maintain her hair&rsquo;s natural shine and strength.</p>

<p>Shraddha Kapoor&rsquo;s approach to beauty and self-care highlights the importance of simplicity, consistency, and inner well-being.</p>

<p>Place your fingers gently on your forehead to anchor your hands. Then, use your thumbs to massage the cheek area. Switch to your knuckles and press gently from the inside of your cheeks outward. Mira lists out the benefits of this step and mentions that not only does it reduce puffiness but also enhances blood flow and skin elasticity.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Under-Eye Massage</strong></p>

<p>The under-eye area can often appear tired or puffy due to screen exposure and stress. Fix your thumb on your upper cheek, then use your knuckles to gently roll along the under-eye region. Mira further mentions that this movement helps reduce dark circles and puffiness and makes the eyes appear more refreshed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Neck and Shoulder Massage</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget your neck and shoulders, these areas hold a lot of tension. As Mira Rajput&nbsp;shows in the video, use both hands to massage your neck in upward strokes.</p>

<p>Mira believes that when done regularly, facial massage can transform your skin. She also mentions that it improves circulation, detoxifies the skin, and gives it a natural lift.

Known for her love for all things natural, Athiya often posts about her skincare routines, and one of her most-loved hacks is an easy under-eye mask that helps reduce puffiness and refresh tired eyes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple, budget-friendly, and can be made using ingredients you already have at home. Here&#39;s how you can make Athiya Shetty&#39;s DIY coffee under-eye mask.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 heaping tablespoons of coffee grounds</p>

<p>1/4 cup of warm water</p>

<p>A few ice cubes</p>

<p>2 cotton pads</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mix the coffee:</strong> In a small bowl, dissolve the coffee grounds in warm water. Stir it well until the mixture is smooth and emulsified.</p>

<p><strong>Cool it down:</strong> Add a couple of ice cubes to the coffee mix to cool it. This will give a refreshing, soothing touch when applied under the eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare the patches: </strong>Cut two cotton pads into crescent shapes that fit neatly under your eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Soak the pads:</strong> Dip the cotton pads into the chilled coffee mixture and let them soak fully.</p>

<p><strong>Apply and relax:</strong> Place the soaked pads gently under your eyes. Sit back and relax for about 10 to 15 minutes or until the cotton pads dry and the mixture is absorbed into your skin.</p>

<p><strong>Rinse:</strong> Once done, rinse your face with cool water to refresh your skin further.</p>

<p>This natural remedy is a favorite of Athiya&#39;s for a reason. It&#39;s quick to make, requires no fancy tools, and can easily become a part of your weekly self-care routine.</p>

<p>While Athiya Shetty has said goodbye to films, her influence in the beauty space continues. The actress made her Bollywood debut in 2015 with Hero, followed by Mubarakan in 2017. Her final screen appearance was in Motichoor Chaknachoor in 2019, where she starred opposite Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Despite getting more film offers, Athiya chose not to pursue acting further.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Zoom, her father, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/suniel-shetty-reveals-secret-to-unbreakable-bond-with-hera-pheri-co-star-akshay-kumar-despite-misunderstandings-if-anyone-tried-to-1388943">Suniel Shetty</a>, shared that Athiya told him she was not interested in continuing with films. Instead, she is now focused on motherhood, which he described as the most important and beautiful role of her life.</p>

<p>Athiya married cricketer KL Rahul in 2023. Earlier this year, the couple welcomed their daughter, Evaarah, whose name means &quot;Gift of God.&quot; While Athiya might be away from the silver screen, she remains close to her fans through her lifestyle choices, self-care routines, and family updates.</p>

From her dazzling performances on-screen to her impeccable grace off it, the Bollywood icon has long been admired for her glowing skin and thick, shiny tresses. But did you know that her haircare secret doesn&rsquo;t lie in expensive products but in a humble homemade remedy? The actor recently shared a 3-ingredient DIY hair mask that&rsquo;s perfect for tackling frizzy, unmanageable hair.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/how-to-look-young-at-58-like-bollywoods-dhak-dhak-girl-madhuri-dixit-1387843">Madhuri Dixit</a>&rsquo;s DIY recipe, which she posted in a video titled &ldquo;My secret for smooth and shiny hair!&rdquo; on her YouTube channel, is simple, affordable, and uses ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen.</p>

<p><strong>How to Make Madhuri Dixit&rsquo;s DIY Hair Mask</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>1 ripe banana (overripe works best)</p>

<p>1 tablespoon coconut oil</p>

<p>&frac12; teaspoon honey</p>

<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>

<p>Mash the Banana: Begin by peeling and thoroughly mashing a ripe banana. An overripe banana is not only easier to blend but also more nutrient-rich, perfect for deep nourishment.</p>

<p>Add Coconut Oil: Mix in 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Madhuri suggests using less oil to avoid excessive greasiness post-wash, making the rinsing process simpler.</p>

<p>Mix in Honey: Finally, add &frac12; teaspoon of honey and stir the ingredients well until you get a smooth, consistent mixture.</p>

<p><strong>How to Apply the Mask</strong></p>

<p>The application is just as easy. Madhuri advises applying the mask from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair, steering clear of the roots to avoid unnecessary oil build-up. You can use your fingers or a hairbrush to ensure even distribution.</p>

<p>Once applied, cover your hair with a shower cap to avoid drips and let the mask sit for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>After the waiting period, simply wash it off with your regular shampoo.</p>

<p>No conditioner needed&mdash;your hair will already feel softer, shinier, and more manageable. The mask can be used once a week for frizz-prone hair or once every 20 days if your hair is finer or less dry.</p>

<p><strong>What Are DIY Hair Masks?</strong></p>

<p>DIY (Do-It-Yourself) hair masks are natural, homemade treatments made using ingredients commonly found in your kitchen. They offer a chemical-free, cost-effective alternative to commercial hair products and are tailored to address specific hair concerns like dryness, frizz, damage, or dullness. Unlike many store-bought products that may contain harsh preservatives or synthetic fragrances, DIY masks are typically gentle and safe for regular use.</p>

<p>Most DIY hair masks use ingredients like yogurt, eggs, aloe vera, oils, honey, and fruits, and each is chosen for its individual benefits. Depending on your hair type and needs, these masks can be customized to provide hydration, volume, repair, or even dandruff relief.</p>

<p>Eisha starts her eye makeup after the base is complete. She fills in her brows using an eyebrow gel, giving them a fuller yet natural look.</p>

<p>For the eyeshadow, she picks shades from a&nbsp;nude palette of her choice, mixing matte tones with a bit of glitter to keep it soft and elegant. &ldquo;Wear your makeup with confidence,&rdquo; she advises viewers, reminding them not to be afraid of trying new shades.</p>

<p>She lines her eyes with an eyeliner pen, a product she seems to enjoy for its precision. Then she curls her lashes and applies&nbsp;mascara to lift them. To add even more volume and length, she layers on another mascara.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Blush and Contour</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to blush, Eisha loves a natural flush. She uses liquid blushes in light shades. Using a brush, she gently taps the product into her cheeks. &ldquo;It gives a natural, dewy look,&rdquo; she says. She admits she should have blended her concealer better before applying blush, but that&rsquo;s what makes the video so real and relatable.</p>

<p>For contour, she uses a contour kit to add some definition to her face.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Lips and Final Touch</strong></p>

<p>Eisha keeps her lips simple yet polished. She first moisturizes them with a lip balm, then applies a lip liner and follows it up with her favorite&nbsp;lipstick. To finish the look, she dabs on some compact, which sets the makeup and removes any unwanted shine.</p>

<p><strong>The Final Word: Water and Rest Are Key</strong></p>

<p>Before wrapping up, Eisha Singh gives an important reminder: drink enough water and get proper sleep. These, according to her, are the real secrets to good skin. Makeup can enhance features, but healthy skin is the real foundation.</p>

<p>Throughout the session, Eisha shares small glimpses of her life, like how she often roams around her house while doing makeup. Her laid-back yet knowledgeable approach makes her tutorial not just helpful but also very real. She encourages beginners to try things out, experiment, and see what makes them feel good.</p>

The diva&rsquo;s cute baby bump and glowing skin have gotten all the attention already, as fans cannot stop gushing over the happy news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, did you know the secret behind her everlasting skin glow is because of a simple 5-step routine she swears by? Read on to find out!</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Cleanse gently, moisturize deeply</strong></p>

<p>The first step for Kiara is to use a gentle cleanser to rid her skin of all impurities, including any makeup residue, while keeping the natural barrier of the skin intact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She then follows it up with a good moisturizer, which consists of vitamin E, leaving her skin feeling hydrated and nourished for a long time.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Never miss out on sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>Kiara Advani&rsquo;s glow never fades away, even when out in the sun. The reason? Well, the diva does not forget to use a sunscreen that protects her skin from the UV rays and acts as another barrier to avoid pigmentation.</p>

<p>For the actress, a good sunscreen is ideally one with a large SPF spectrum and also has some nourishing properties. It also must not leave a white cast on her face and blend nicely.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Hydration is key&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Throughout her day, Kiara keeps fulfilling the fluid requirements of her body and skin and keeps track of her water intake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While she begins her day with a glass of warm water, she ensures that throughout the rest of the day, she consumes enough fluids (juices, water, etc.) to keep her skin supple, nourished and hydrated.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Don&rsquo;t take makeup to bed</strong></p>

<p>Kiara Advani has been an advocate for minimal makeup trends most of the time. However, once back from work, the first and most important thing for her is to remove all of it before hitting the bed.</p>

<p>Sleeping with makeup is a big no-no for her, as keeping it overnight on her face blocks pores and makes her skin unable to breathe. Finally, she ends her day by applying a generous amount of night cream, which nourishes, repairs and rejuvenates her skin.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Secret hack passed down from her grandmother</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest secrets behind Kiara Advani&rsquo;s all-time glowing skin is a very special hack passed down from her grandmother. Well, ditching store-bought cleansers, the diva trusts the goodness of natural ingredients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She often uses a homemade face pack made of besan, malai, and honey, which forms a thick paste. This helps to give her skin the best detox ever, leaving it feeling refreshed and glowing.&nbsp;</p>

The diva&rsquo;s hair is literal goals as she flaunts long and luscious strands, which can leave anyone smitten. However, such charming hair can&rsquo;t be achieved easily; it&rsquo;s a result of conscious efforts. From being picky about haircare products to following a 6-step hairwash day routine, here&rsquo;s everything Sonam Kapoor does to keep her hair healthy, long, and shiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s haircare ritual&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sonam&rsquo;s haircare routine displays her love for her hair. While you might think it must be high-end and complicated, it&rsquo;s, in fact, quite practical and accessible. Check the process and steps:</p>

<p><strong>1. Shampoo&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sonam Kapoor shampoos her hair twice. This technique is in trend, and more and more people are practicing it. Shampooing twice or double cleansing helps in deep cleaning and getting rid of buildup. And when you&rsquo;re in an industry where your hair constantly goes through all sorts of processes, double cleansing becomes a necessity.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Conditioner&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/sonam-kapoor-enjoys-her-week-off-in-abstract-print-taffeta-midi-dress-and-hermes-sling-bag-1384975">The Khoobsrat actress</a> strongly emphasizes conditioning after shampooing. When you&rsquo;re double cleansing, your hair might lose moisture and become dry and frizzy. To replenish the lost moisture and keep your strands smooth and manageable, conditioner is important. Further adding on the technique of applying a conditioner, Kapoor suggests not applying it to the scalp. However, she does apply conditioner from high up, all the way to the ends, thoroughly treating her hair.</p>

<p>PS: The actress suggests towel drying after shampooing and before applying conditioner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Hand perm&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After going through a catastrophic experience with perming on one of her salon visits, Mrs. Ahuja took matters into her hands. She does hand perm, a simple hair styling technique which is in trend. This involves crunching your hair upwards with your hands, after the conditioner, to create a naturally wavy texture.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Serum</strong></p>

<p>Serum is hands down one of Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s favorite haircare products. She towel-dries her hair after washing off the conditioner and then applies serum. Kapoor emphasizes applying serum on the ends as well to lock in the moisture and have a silky and smooth effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Heat protectant&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Being in the showbiz, Sonam&rsquo;s hair go through a lot. To protect them from possible damage, she applies heat protectant as part of haircare ritual. However, things like heat blow drying and UV radiation can also damage hair, making it equally important to apply a heat protectant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. Bow dry or blast dry&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>After her hair is ready to take the heat with the heat protectant, Kapoor goes on with blow-dry or blast-dry to style her hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Biggest hair mistake&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>At one time or another, we all have gone crazy with our hair. This includes cutting bangs at home, coloring with no professional guidance, or straightening them until they turn into a broom. For Sonam, it was perming hair. She got her hair permed for a movie often, leading to brutally damaging results. Sharing the regrettable anecdote, Vaayu&rsquo;s mom further mentioned that in such situations, good salon advice is needed. Kapoor revealed that it took her 5 years to regrow and re-strengthen her hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Take professional guidance before going through a hair change to avoid any future oopsies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Obsession with long hair&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/sonam-kapoor-spending-her-week-off-with-vayu-without-distractions-is-major-mother-son-bonding-goals-dont-miss-their-fun-workout-1384965">The Zoya Factor actress</a> has luscious and long hair reaching below her waist. In an interview with Grazia, the style maven opened up about her obsession with extended tresses. She revealed that she has always had long hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has cut her hair only a few times, including for the movies Ayesha and Khoobsurat. However, her hair grows quickly, letting her get into her everyday avatar quite easily. Ditching the trends, she often chooses long hair as her go-to style.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s haircare tips&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Being a hair enthusiast, Sonam Kapoor is always on the lookout for tricks and techniques that would keep her hair strong and luscious. She shared a few haircare tips from her trove of haircare wisdom:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be very careful and mindful about choosing the right haircare products and taking the right advice from professionals.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Be aware of your hair problems and take preventative measures at the earliest.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A heat protectant is a must. Especially if your hair goes through constant treatments and exploitation.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Consume protein and have a balanced diet that supports hair growth and strengthening.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

Shanaya Kapoor's Goa diaries]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-05/304178175_image-43.jpg"></img><p>Shanaya Kapoor&rsquo;s recent photos from Goa have everyone dreaming of a beach vacation. With her sun-kissed selfies, breezy outfits, and stunning sunset views, it&#39;s easy to see why the beach life looks so tempting. But with all the beauty that comes with coastal getaways, there&rsquo;s one common concern&mdash;sun tanning.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re already imagining your toes in the sand but worried about skin damage, relax. Here&#39;s how you can enjoy the sunshine without bringing back unwanted tan lines, dryness, or breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Start With the Right Sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>This is the golden rule. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 50. Look for UVA and UVB protection. Mineral-based sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are gentler on sensitive skin and work instantly after application.</p>

<p>Apply it 30 minutes before stepping out into the sun, and reapply every 2 hours, especially after swimming or sweating. Don&rsquo;t skip spots like your ears, neck, feet, and the back of your hands.</p>

<p><strong>2. Cover Up With Light Layers</strong></p>

<p>Shanaya&#39;s comfy loungewear and oversized shirts are not just stylish&mdash;they&rsquo;re smart. Loose, cotton, or linen fabrics allow your skin to breathe while shielding it from harsh rays. A full-sleeve shirt, wide-brimmed hat, and UV-protective sunglasses can go a long way in reducing direct exposure.</p>

<p><strong>3. Avoid Peak Sun Hours</strong></p>

<p>The sun is most intense between 10 AM and 4 PM. Plan your beach walks or sunbathing either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Take breaks under umbrellas, beach tents, or shaded spots to give your skin some rest.</p>

<p><strong>4. Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize</strong></p>

<p>Saltwater, sand, and the sun can dry out your skin. Use a light, water-based moisturizer post-shower to restore hydration. For extra nourishment, pack an aloe vera gel&mdash;it soothes sunburns and calms irritated skin.</p>

<p>If your skin feels itchy or tight, apply hydrating sheet masks in the evening. And don&rsquo;t forget your lips&mdash;carry a lip balm with SPF to keep them soft and protected.</p>

<p><strong>5. Stay Hydrated</strong></p>

<p>Shanaya&#39;s Goa food diaries included lots of fruits, and there&rsquo;s a reason why. A fruit-rich diet can boost skin health from within. Add watermelon, oranges, cucumbers, and coconut water to your beach menu. Drink at least 2-3 liters of water daily to keep your skin plump and glowing.</p>

<p><strong>6. Use Physical Barriers on the Beach</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re lounging for hours, consider using a beach mat, towel, or even a portable umbrella to block direct contact with hot sand. Sand can reflect UV rays back onto your skin, increasing the risk of tanning and even sunburn.</p>

<p><strong>7. Use After-Sun Care Products</strong></p>

<p>Once your beach day ends, give your skin some love. Cool showers, gentle exfoliation with a soft scrub, and calming lotions with chamomile or cucumber extracts help your skin recover overnight. Products with vitamin E and antioxidants are also great for reversing early sun damage.</p>

<p><strong>8. Opt for Tinted Moisturizers or BB Creams Instead of Heavy Makeup</strong></p>

<p>Wearing full makeup on the beach can clog pores and cause breakouts. Instead, use a tinted SPF moisturizer or BB cream, especially if you want to even out skin tone. Choose non-comedogenic products that allow your skin to breathe.</p>

<p><strong>9. Take Extra Care of Sensitive Areas</strong></p>

<p>The skin around your eyes is thinner and more prone to sun damage. Wear UV-blocking sunglasses, and if needed, dab a small amount of SPF-infused eye cream around the area. Your scalp is also at risk&mdash;wear a hat or apply a spray sunscreen on your hair parting.</p>

<p><strong>10. Limit Exfoliation Before and During the Trip</strong></p>

<p>Many people think scrubbing off the tan will help. In reality, over-exfoliating can strip away the skin&rsquo;s natural oils and increase sun sensitivity. Exfoliate once a week, not more. Be gentle and follow up with deep moisturization.</p>

<p><strong>11. Choose Your Beach Beauty Products Wisely</strong></p>

<p>When on a coastal trip, switch to oil-free, non-comedogenic, and fragrance-free products. The humid beach climate can trigger breakouts or rashes. Also, avoid using products with retinol, AHAs, or BHAs before sun exposure&mdash;they can make your skin more sensitive to light.</p>

<p>Shanaya Kapoor&rsquo;s sun-kissed Goa vacation photos may make you want to hit the beach right away. And rightly so! But while you&#39;re chasing sunsets and sipping smoothies, don&rsquo;t forget your skin needs a little extra love. From choosing the right SPF to staying hydrated and protected, beach skincare doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated. Just a few thoughtful steps can help you enjoy your getaway glow without the unwanted tan.</p>

While her stunning looks leave everyone in awe, the secret lies in the simple yet essential regimen she follows without fail.</p>

<p>In one of the videos on her YouTube channel, the diva offered a glimpse into the detailed steps of her skincare routine and even listed the products she uses.</p>

<p>Check out the 5 must-have beauty products from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/people/7-best-korean-skincare-products-to-add-to-your-beauty-routine-alia-bhatt-swears-by-avocado-ceramide-recovery-serum-1387863">Alia Bhatt</a>&rsquo;s vanity that are absolute essentials for a good skincare routine:</p>

<p><strong>1. Jade roller/skin massager</strong></p>

<p>The first step in Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s skincare regime is using a jade roller (also known as a skin massager) across her cheekbones and jawline. It helps calm the skin, boosts blood circulation, and reduces signs of fatigue.</p>

<p><strong>2. Eye cream</strong></p>

<p>Alia works through a hectic schedule which often leads to less sleep. As a result, it causes dark circles, which is where a good under-eye cream comes in handy. It also helps with dryness around the eyes.</p>

<p>She applies the Farmacy Dew It All Total Eye Cream before any other product and allows it to settle down a bit before proceeding with other items.</p>

<p><strong>3. Watermelon glow niacinamide</strong></p>

<p>Alia Bhatt credits niacinamide in her skincare routine for reducing fine lines and protecting skin from pollution. It also helps regenerate and hydrate the skin.</p>

<p>The Raazi actress uses Glow Recipe&rsquo;s Watermelon Glow Niacinamide Drops, applying it generously all over her face.</p>

<p><strong>4. Watermelon juice moisturizer</strong></p>

<p>Moisturizing is a non-negotiable step in Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s skincare routine. She generously applies moisturizer to keep her skin hydrated throughout long shooting days.</p>

<p>The diva uses Glow Recipe&rsquo;s Watermelon Juice Moisturizer, applying it all over her face, neck, and hands.</p>

<p><strong>5. Fotoprotector Fusion Water Sunscreen</strong></p>

<p>The final and most crucial step in Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s skincare routine is sunscreen. She advises applying it everywhere&mdash;even indoors&mdash;since harmful sun rays can penetrate and damage the skin.</p>

<p>Alia uses ISDIN&rsquo;s Fotoprotector Fusion Water Sunscreen with broad-spectrum SPF 50, generously applying it all over her face and neck before makeup.</p>

<p>Before applying her favorite red lipstick combo, the Zoya Factor actress dabs a tiny amount of coconut oil&mdash;a staple in every Indian household&mdash;on her lips. This helps the lipstick glide on smoothly, bringing out its true color. She also shared that most lip balms tend to dull the lipstick&rsquo;s real shade, affecting its overall vibe.</p>

But it&#39;s not just his acting that&#39;s grabbing attention; his effortlessly cool curly hair is making waves too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When someone once asked Ishaan about the secret behind his curls, he gave a heartfelt answer that he got them from his mother. With his trademark wit, he clarified, &quot;Not from where, but from whom&mdash;my mom.&quot; For those who don&#39;t know, Ishaan is the son of veteran actress Neelima Azeem and actor Rajesh Khattar. He also shares a strong bond with his half-brother, actor Shahid Kapoor, Neelima&#39;s son from her previous marriage to actor Pankaj Kapur. It&#39;s clear that his striking curls, much like his talent, run in the family.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking to rock a similar curly hairstyle, here&#39;s a simple guide to help you achieve and maintain those chaotic curls.</p>

<p><strong>Embrace your natural texture</strong></p>

<p>Curly hair is unique and requires specific care to look its best. Whether you have natural curls or are aiming to create them, understanding your hair type is the first step.</p>

<p>Identify Your Curl Type: Hair types range from wavy (Type 2) to curly (Type 3) and coily (Type 4). Knowing your type helps you select the right products and styling techniques.</p>

<p>Consult a Professional: A hairstylist can provide insights into your hair type and recommend suitable cuts and products.</p>

<p><strong>Right haircut matters</strong></p>

<p>A well-chosen haircut can enhance your curls and make styling easier.</p>

<p>Layered Cuts: Adding layers can reduce bulk and allow curls to form naturally.</p>

<p>Regular Trims: Trimming every 6-8 weeks prevents split ends and maintains the shape of your hairstyle.</p>

<p><strong>Washing and conditioning</strong></p>

<p>Curly hair tends to be drier than straight hair, so proper washing and conditioning are crucial.</p>

<p>Use Sulfate-Free Shampoo: Sulfates can strip natural oils, leading to dryness. Opt for gentle, sulfate-free shampoos.</p>

<p>Condition Generously: A good conditioner hydrates and detangles curls. Apply it generously and consider using a wide-tooth comb to distribute it evenly.</p>

<p>Deep Conditioning: Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to restore moisture and elasticity.</p>

<p><strong>Styling Your Curls</strong></p>

<p>Styling curly hair involves techniques that define curls and reduce frizz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apply Products on Wet Hair: After washing, apply curl-enhancing products like creams or gels while your hair is still wet to lock in moisture and definition.</p>

<p>Scrunching: Gently scrunch your hair upwards to encourage curl formation. Avoid rubbing or tousling, which can cause frizz.</p>

<p>Use a Diffuser: Attach a diffuser to distribute heat evenly and maintain curl patterns when blow-drying. Use a low heat setting to prevent damage.</p>

<p><strong>Nighttime Care</strong></p>

<p>Protecting your curls while you sleep helps maintain their shape and health.</p>

<p>Silk or Satin Pillowcases: These materials reduce friction, preventing frizz and breakage.</p>

<p>Pineapple Method: Gather your hair into a loose, high ponytail to preserve curls overnight.</p>

<p>Avoid Overwashing: Washing hair too frequently can strip natural oils. Aim to wash your hair 2-3 times a week.</p>

<p>Limit Heat Styling: Excessive heat can damage curls. If you must use heat tools, always apply a heat protectant.</p>

<p>Stay Hydrated and Eat Well: Healthy hair starts from within. Drink plenty of water and maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p>Following these steps, you can achieve a curly hairstyle reminiscent of Ishaan Khatter&#39;s iconic look. Embrace your natural texture, care for your curls diligently, and you&#39;ll be turning heads in no time.</p>

According to Adam Schaffner, a Triple Board-certified plastic surgeon, Kim should have opted for safer alternatives. However, Dr. William Bruno feels that it would be unfair to compare her current state to her younger days.</p>

<p>Kim Novak&rsquo;s plastic surgery tells the tale of Hollywood&rsquo;s obsession with toxic beauty standards that push many celebrities to opt for plastic surgeries. Her cosmetic procedures were failed attempts at restoring her youth, which backfired. The saga is not a fancy tale of amplifying youthfulness. Instead, it is a real-life story from which one can learn and take lessons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter how advanced plastic surgeries, facial treatments, and cosmetic alterations are, one should be aware of the results. For Kim Novak, her non-surgical facelift didn&rsquo;t bear fruitful results, affecting her image and career. However, it is commendable how, despite her personal struggles and insecurities, she had the guts to speak about her regrets. Today, she serves as a poignant reminder of the unpredictable nature of such procedures.</p>

</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Persistent Stains:</strong> If stubborn stains remain even after deep cleaning, the beauty blender may not be as effective.</li>
	<li><strong>Texture Changes:</strong> If the sponge becomes too soft or loses its bounce, it&rsquo;s a sign that it&rsquo;s breaking down and should be replaced.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a worn-out beauty blender can lead to less effective makeup application and an increased risk of skin issues, so it&rsquo;s important to replace it regularly.</p>

<p>With our guide on how to wash beauty blenders the right way, you can easily clean the makeup tools without causing many conundrums or failures.

<h3><strong>Emily Ratajkowski&#39;s Surgery</strong><strong> for Abs</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">Creating slits in eyebrows is a quick and easy process, but there are essential tips and precautions you must keep in mind before going ahead with it.</p>

<p>1. If you pluck your eyebrows too aggressively, you could end up with permanent alopecia and struggle with regrowth forever. So, think twice before picking up those tweezers.</p>

<p>2. Make certain that all tools used during the process are cleansed and disinfected. Refrain from employing razors or electric trimmers that are not your own. This is imperative for safety and hygiene purposes.</p>

<p>3. Be gentle during the process and shave only as much as needed. Overdoing it could lead to an unpleasant result or even cause harm.</p>

<p>4. If you get a cut, ensure to use an antiseptic liquid to avoid any infections.</p>

<p>5. Keep in mind that eyebrow slits are often linked with gang culture and violence. Make sure that the people around you are not offended by this form of self-expression before proceeding.</p>

<p>Eyebrow slits, once exclusive to celebrity culture, are now more popular than ever. The trend may have been popularized by Tom Hardy, Jason Momoa, Lesley Ann Brandt, and Zayn Malik, but it&#39;s up to you to give it your unique twist and make it your own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hesitate any longer now that you know how to do eyebrow slits. Unleash your artistic spirit and make those slits pop! Just remember to be careful when shaping them and avoid using scissors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And if you accidentally shave off a bit too much, fear not! Your trusty eyebrow pencil will come to the rescue, allowing you to easily conceal any unwanted gaps. It&#39;s time to make a dramatic statement with your eyebrows, so go ahead and let your creative juices flow!</p>

Previously, her lips were luscious and well-shaped, but in recent times, they have taken on an unnaturally fuller appearance. Both her upper and lower lips seem significantly larger than they appeared just a few years ago, and they have become a dominant feature of her face.

However, the artist has not confirmed whether she has had lip fillers or injections.</p>

<h3><strong>Maren Morris Botox</strong></h3>

<p><em>My Church</em> singer, Morris Morris, has been a subject of speculation about Botox injections despite not admitting to using them. Someone suggested she lay off the Botox, but Morris subtly shared that it&#39;s no longer part of the picture, thanks to her recent pregnancy and time spent in quarantine. This reply implies that Botox could have played a role in maintaining her consistently tight, smooth, and wrinkle-free brow, although there&#39;s been no official confirmation from her end.</p>

<h3><strong>Maren Morris Boob Job</strong></h3>

<h2 id="6891f3860f959"><strong>Maren Morris&#39;s Reaction to Plastic Surgery Allegations</strong></h2>

<p>Maren Morris has consistently responded to plastic surgery claims and body-shaming comments with confidence and humor. In April 2020, she addressed a troll&#39;s remark about Botox by explaining that she had just gone through a pregnancy and that the effects of Botox had long worn off.

<p>In July 2020, when another hater commented on the size of her breasts, Maren humorously replied, &quot;Don&#39;t let my boobs knock you on the way out,&quot; accompanied by a crying-laughing emoji. This response showcased her ability to stand up for herself while maintaining a sense of humor.</p>

It is rumored that the Dhadhak actress underwent rhinoplasty to define her broad nose, a lip job to enhance her pout, and a jawline surgery to make it look more angular. The results are evident, and Jhanvi looks stunning!</p>

<p>It is no secret celebrity nose jobs have become common in Bollywood, Hollywood, and the entertainment industry. Celebrities have been open about going under the knife to achieve their desired look, whether for aesthetic purposes or to correct a breathing problem. With technological advancements and medical procedures, plastic surgery has become more accessible and affordable for many individuals. However, it is essential to remember that cosmetic surgery is not a solution to underlying self-esteem and self-worth issues. Instead, it is merely a tool to enhance one&#39;s appearance and confidence.</p>

<p>In conclusion, beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, and it is up to each individual to decide however they want to present themselves to the world. So whether it&#39;s a celebrity nose job or someone embracing their natural features, remember that beauty indeed lies in the eye of the beholder.</p>
