With its global fame, the K-drama spawned a spin-off called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hospital-playlists-jo-jung-suk-jeon-mi-do-jung-kyung-ho-and-more-lend-their-voices-to-resident-playbook-ost-1378926">Resident Playbook</a>, where the original show&rsquo;s cast members had cameos, which was released in 2025. However, the desire for a return of the 99ers gang has long been awaited. Now, actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/connection-starring-ji-sung-and-jeon-mi-do-know-where-to-watch-release-date-time-plot-cast-and-more-1308088">Jeon Mi Do</a>, who plays Chae Song Hwa, has spilled that season 3 may happen sooner than we expected.</p>

<p><strong>Jeon Mi Do shares the Hospital Playlist cast&rsquo;s desire for season 3 and the makers&rsquo; promise</strong></p>

<p>In a chat with Woman Donga, Jeon Mi Do spoke about the undying wish fans as well as the cast members have for a return of the show. She revealed how the conversation is not ending for the actors and the creators as well, who have long been pestered about it, saying, &ldquo;The director (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-hospital-playlist-season-3-happen-anytime-soon-director-shin-won-ho-says-fan-pressure-is-affecting-plans-1382726">Shin Won Ho</a>) and writer (Lee Woo Jung) promised, &#39;We&#39;ll do it within five years.&rsquo; We always talk about it in our group chat. We&#39;re all eagerly awaiting it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Adding how the one part she&rsquo;s excited about, remains the love line between herself and the character played by Jo Jung Suk, she shared, &ldquo;I&#39;m also very curious to see what kind of doctor Song Hwa will be with [Lee] Ik Jun.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Addressing the fans directly, she expressed hopeful words, &ldquo;I hope that if you just trust me and wait a little longer, there will be good news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lot remains to be explored with the characters in the show, including the love stories of many couples. From all five original cast members finding their partners by the end of season 2 to their juniors getting involved more in their lives, &nbsp;a glimpse was shared during their appearances on Resident Playbook starring Go Yoon Jung, Shin Si Ah, Kang You Seok, Han Ye Ji, and Jung Joon Won.</p>

Agency responds to reports ahead of intimate wedding]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/872955874_taecyeon.webp"></img><p>Another 2PM member is set to tie the knot soon! Following the marriage ceremony of the youngest star, Chansung, last year, it was revealed that member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/taecyeon-seohyuns-the-first-night-with-the-duke-under-police-probe-for-unesco-heritage-site-damage-director-publicly-apologizes-1391263">Taecyeon</a> had proposed to his longtime girlfriend and is all set to marry her early in 2026. Confirming his plans, his acting management label shared in November that their artist would be marrying in Seoul, set for a Spring wedding. Now new reports have surfaced that the said ceremony will be held on April 24 at a private location. His agency has decided not to reveal any details owing to the bride-to-be&rsquo;s non-celebrity status and requested warm support instead.</p>

<p><strong>Taecyeon&rsquo;s marriage details to remain under wraps, says agency</strong></p>

<p>On February 25, SPOTV shared that Ok Taecyeon&rsquo;s wedding will be held on April 24. Responding to the same, his management label 51K shared their official position, choosing to remain tight-lipped about the details, &ldquo;Out of consideration for the bride-to-be, who is a non-celebrity, all details regarding the wedding, including the schedule, will be kept private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, they hope the fans of the star can cheer for his new path and added, &ldquo;We kindly ask for your understanding that specific information related to the wedding cannot be disclosed. Please send your blessings and warm support as actor Ok Taecyeon begins this new chapter of his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While not much is known about the couple, it has been reported that the two have been dating for a long time, with speculations suggesting a decade-long relationship. The singer-actor&rsquo;s girlfriend is said to be four years younger than him, and the two have been spotted overseas on a few occasions. Previously, photos surfaced of the actor getting down on a knee in front of Paris&rsquo; Eiffel Tower in an apparent proposal, which was later shared by his agency to be a birthday celebration instead.&nbsp;</p>

Among the many composers and producers who have worked with the group on the album previously, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/arirang-diplo-confirms-work-on-bts-album-is-his-biggest-work-yet-says-it-will-shock-the-world-1400578">Diplo confirmed his contribution</a>, and now, OneRepublic&rsquo;s Ryan Tedder has chimed in about it being a &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; thing in his own career.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>After Diplo, Ryan Tedder calls the BTS album one of his biggest works done</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the crowd during the group&rsquo;s set for the OneRepublic From Asia, With Love 2026 in Seoul concert, he spoke about how he has two jobs, one in his own group and one back in the studio with many artists. Ryan Tedder then said, &ldquo;Most recently, I did a lot of work on the upcoming BTS album,&rdquo; earning loud cheers from them. Asking attendees whether they wanted to hear more, he said, and started off by building hype around his work with the septet, &quot;Working on <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-if-theyll-submit-arirang-for-grammy-rm-reacts-to-k-pop-nods-dont-want-to-be-desperately-1400723">BTS</a>&#39; new album is truly amazing... You&#39;ll probably love it.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to share his praise for the group and their work, &quot;I&rsquo;ll say this. It absolutely blew me away how talented they (BTS) were. Honestly, it&#39;s one of the craziest things I&#39;ve ever worked on in my whole career. Ever. It&rsquo;s crazy. I think I know you&#39;re going to love it. So that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m going to say.&rdquo; He then joked, &quot;I think I&#39;ll get in trouble if I say more, so I&#39;ll stop here.&quot;</p>

<p>The man behind contributions to Grammy-winning albums like Adele&#39;s 21 and 25, and Taylor Swift&#39;s 1989, has dipped his toes in the world of K-pop many times before. From BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa&#39;s ROCKSTAR, TWICE&#39;s CRY FOR ME, TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s Back for More and Do It Like That, and he has even worked on BTS&rsquo; Jimin&#39;s Be Mine. With many hits under his own group, the One Republic star managed to raise the stakes for the upcoming album even further.</p>

<p>BTS will release their 5th full-length album ARIRANG on March 20, 2026.</p>

In the text, following message was written, &lsquo;(There&#39;s always talk of plagiarism, and it&#39;s not once not been mentioned) Huh... that&rsquo;s what. I took a look as well and thought, &lsquo;Oh, this is kinda similar&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead of relying on his agency to comment on the issue, V took the matter into his own hands. Taking a stand against the use of his chat without his permission, he wrote on his social media handle, &ldquo;This is part of a private, everyday conversation that I shared with empathy, as they were my acquaintance. I have no intention of taking sides. However, I find it very upsetting (surprised, or embarrassed, or taken aback) that the conversation in question was submitted as evidence without my consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTS is all set to release a new album called <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-reveals-if-theyll-submit-arirang-for-grammy-rm-reacts-to-k-pop-nods-dont-want-to-be-desperately-1400723">ARIRANG</a> on March 20, 2026, which be followed by a world tour across 81 stops in 34 cities.

Jo Jung Suk’s ‘secret relationship’ remark shocks actor]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1244381088_yoo-yeon-seok.webp"></img><p>Yoo Yeon Seok&rsquo;s private life always has the attention of all his fans. At the age of 43, the star is not known to be dating anyone publicly; however, he has been rumored to be in a relationship with many of his co-stars. Now, a new remark from his dear friend Jo Jung Suk has raised questions among fans about whether he has had a secret romance all this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jo Jung Suk&rsquo;s &lsquo;secret relationship&rsquo; comment to Yoo Yeon Seok grabs attention</strong></p>

<p>As seen on the Seollal (Lunar New Year) special episode of the variety show Whenever Possible, hosted by Yoo Jae Suk and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/not-something-yoo-yeon-seok-reveals-if-he-plans-on-marrying-when-the-phone-rings-co-star-chae-soo-bin-1365814">Yoo Yeon Seok</a>, the latter gave a phone call to his Hospital Playlist co-star Jo Jung Suk to congratulate him on welcoming his second daughter with wife Gummy in January 2026. During their telephonic chat, in which the other cast members also shared their wishes, the father of two made a surprising remark just before ending the call. He said, &quot;You should get married soon, too. Don&#39;t keep your relationship a secret,&quot; aimed at the Mr.m Sunshine actor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Catching him off guard, the younger actor immediately lowered the volume on his phone, hung up, and replied, &quot;Even my uncle wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; which invited laughter. This interaction has welcomed quite a number of questions from the fans of the When the Phone Rings star. While there continues to be buzz around his relationship, the actor has remained tight-lipped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the star couple, actor Jo Jung Suk and singer Gummy, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jo-jung-suk-and-gummy-become-parents-for-second-time-welcome-daughter-to-world-1399898">welcomed their second child</a>, a daughter, as announced on January 14 local time.

The two got married back on October 8, 2018, in a private ceremony attended by family members and friends, after dating for five years.&nbsp;</p>

She also revealed other cast members&rsquo; reactions, &ldquo;The panelists apologized to all the cast members. We were actually very grateful. It was a very warm moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 26-year-old also revealed if the public&rsquo;s widely negative reaction to her decisions on the show affected her, sharing that she tried not to look up the reactions. Moreover, she admitted that her choices surprised her at times, &ldquo;The panelists&rsquo; honest reactions helped viewers relate. Even I acted strangely at times. I think their comments were justified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Choi Mina Sue ended up choosing contestant Lee Sung Hun in the end, although the two did not decide to date outside of the show owing to their starkly different schedules and living arrangements.

Here's why fans think so]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/461820911_lim-ji-yeon-lee-do-hyun.jpg"></img><p>Korean actors Lim Ji Yeon and Lee Do Hyun surprised the world, their fans, and especially the viewers of the thriller drama The Glory when they confirmed that they were dating. After they crossed paths on the sets of the Song Hye Kyo starrer, they remained friends and began dating shortly after, as reported, however it seems that now the wedding bells are ringing for the two. Or so the fans are convinced, as they spotted the actress following a wedding planner account on her social media. The two sides are yet to make any statements on the matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Actor couple Lim Ji Yeon and Lee Do Hyun seemingly eye marriage plans, here&rsquo;s what we know</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/how-can-he-not-be-dating-lim-ji-yeon-comments-on-revolver-co-star-ji-chang-wooks-romantic-life-watch-1338417">Lim Ji Yeon</a> has not been subtle about her blooming love for fellow actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-do-hyun-shows-1329278">Lee Do Hyun</a>, and rightly so. Her heart-filled eyes, visible during any talk about her boyfriend, have always invited adoration from each of their fandoms, and now it seems they may be ready for more. The 35-year-old was noted to have been following a wedding planner account from her Instagram handle, a detail that fans are convinced points to their upcoming wedding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the &lsquo;Mrs Quokka | Wedding preparation and dating&rsquo; account includes other celebrity followers, it was Lim Ji Yeon&rsquo;s unexpected follow that has invited questions about whether the couple is looking to say their I dos soon. Fans of the two have polarizing reactions to this, with some saying that it seems only natural that the duo would aim for marriage, while others have pointed out that Lee Do Hyun is very early into his career and may want to wait. A few have noted their 5-year age gap.</p>

<p>Amid all the speculations, there has been no update from the parties involved. They confirmed they were dating back in early 2023 and have been through the 30-year-old star&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-do-hyun-fan-meet-2025-exhuma-star-announces-asia-tour-one-day-after-military-discharge-check-schedule-1387673">military enlistment phase</a> in their years of dating, remaining strong through it all.</p>

So when the announcement for a new album came through, many wondered if the team would be interested in getting nominated once again. Leader RM is unsure of it as of now, but instead appreciates all the charm of the show, including the recent increase in K-pop nominees, including BLACKPINK member Ros&eacute; and KPop Demon Hunters&rsquo; appearance in the Big Four categories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS reacts to possibly submitting ARIRANG to the Grammys</strong></p>

<p>Reflecting on the growing number of K-pop nominees at the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-members-custom-grammy-awards-performance-suits-to-be-exhibited-at-seouls-jewelry-museum-from-sept-to-dec-1323292">Grammy Awards</a>, including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/grammys-2026-blackpinks-rose-makes-history-as-1st-k-pop-soloist-performing-kpop-demon-hunters-golden-locks-debut-win-1400390">Ros&eacute;</a>&rsquo;s two Big Four nods for APT. and KPop Demon Hunters&rsquo; total five, out of which they won one, RM shared with GQ, &ldquo;There are a lot of K-pop-related nominees you see in the general field and, really, I want to send big applause for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sharing that the thought of winning a golden gramophone is still a goal for the team, the captain calls it far-fetched for the group. More than a month before the release of their 5th studio album, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/arirang-diplo-confirms-work-on-bts-album-is-his-biggest-work-yet-says-it-will-shock-the-world-1400578">ARIRANG</a>, leader RM added, &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;ll try. Maybe we&rsquo;ll submit our album to the Grammys again. But I don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t want to be desperately eager for it&hellip;. We don&rsquo;t want to say anymore like, &lsquo;Ah, man, we want the Grammys.&rsquo; I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we really don&rsquo;t want it&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll try. But if not, then okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>BTS nabbed a nomination for Dynamite in 2021 and then for Butter in 2022, and finally three more in 2023 for Yet To Come, My Universe with Coldplay, and Music of the Spheres as a featured artist, but walked away empty-handed all times, infuriating their fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the group seems to be more than accepting of their missed chance with the Recording Academy&rsquo;s awards, and although it is one of the accolades they haven&rsquo;t managed to grab so far, they&rsquo;re not heavily relying on it. &ldquo;Now, the most important thing is just that we are here back together again, we&rsquo;re going to see the fans all over the world,&rdquo; concluded RM.</p>

Ahead of releasing their fifth studio album, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/is-bts-filming-arirang-comeback-music-video-in-lisbon-fans-spot-group-at-dubai-airport-layover-1400436">ARIRANG</a>, the group is sharing their thoughts on being away from the limelight for so long, owing to their military enlistments, and on their return, leader RM spoke up about feeling the pressure from all around the world for a banging comeback. He opened up about considering a hiatus and even disbandment, which surprised millions. Now, fellow bandmates shared with GQ how they took the fun route instead of taking it too seriously.</p>

<p><strong>BTS reveals how they coped with RM&rsquo;s honest live session</strong></p>

<p>Back in December 2025, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-did-rm-say-its-time-to-disband-bts-know-truth-behind-hilarious-livestream-exchange-with-jimin-1398647">RM</a> had spoken about how massive the pressure is for the group. While contemplating whether to go for sleeping pills, while wondering if the team should take a break or break up, after all, the singer managed to shock their millions of fans. However, the other <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-walk-kings-road-during-gwanghwamun-square-comeback-live-heres-what-we-know-1400450">BTS</a> members, the only people who could understand just exactly what was going through the leader&rsquo;s mind, decided to take it in stride. Making fun of the situation, they shared memes of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, none of us watched that video of the live-streaming,&rdquo; V shared, who admitted that being the captain of the ship comes with more pressure for the 31-year-old, with Jin adding that they had only witnessed short-form content versions of the livestream. SUGA added that the members don&rsquo;t often consume each other&rsquo;s chats with their fans, and it&rsquo;d be &lsquo;weird&rsquo; to watch it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always together, and we&rsquo;re like brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clarifying that it was indeed RM&rsquo;s deep honesty with the ARMY and his way of being vulnerable, the team resorted to making fun of him for it instead of calling him out, terming his vulnerability as his love language. Jimin shared that the group isn&rsquo;t the type to console each other, &ldquo;But we just laugh and make fun of the person to make him laugh and forget about it&hellip;. We also had some drinks together. Booze always works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The group, although also affected themselves, decided to focus on meme-making and pretending that nothing happened.&nbsp;</p>

As revealed by his management label Big Planet Made on February 12 local time, the duo is expecting their second child. Actress Lee Da In is believed to be 5 months pregnant, with the couple focusing on the mother&rsquo;s health at this point in the pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lee Seung Gi and Lee Da In expand their family with the upcoming birth of their second child</strong></p>

<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-seung-gi-wishes-for-kids-health-after-visiting-childrens-hospital-with-his-and-lee-da-ins-10-month-old-daughter-pics-1362926">Lee Seung Gi</a>&#39;s agency Big Planet Made shared with OSEN, &quot;Lee Da In is five months pregnant, and Lee Seung Gi and Lee Da In are prioritizing the mother&#39;s health and stability and focusing on prenatal care.&quot; The happy update comes two years after the birth of their firstborn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple first publicly confirmed their relationship in May 2021 and held their wedding in April 2023. They then welcomed their first child, a daughter, in February of the following year. With the announcement of their second pregnancy, congratulatory messages have continued to pour in for the family.</p>

<p>Lee Seung Gi has previously been called &lsquo;daughter fool,&rsquo; a colloquial nickname attached to fathers who deeply adore their daughters. The Vagabond actor has previously shared how he definitely recommends marriage and starting a family, while sharing his happiness from developing a bond with his wife and child. During an appearance on the variety show My Little Old Boy, he recalled the satisfaction that taking his young daughter to and from her school brings him. He has acknowledged that being married and having a kid come with their fair share of issues, but he has managed to overcome them with the happiness of a growing family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actor has faced much criticism from the masses for his in-laws&rsquo; controversial positioning in society, and previously decided to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-seung-gi-apologizes-for-father-in-laws-illegal-stock-manipulation-cuts-ties-with-wifes-family-citing-damaged-trust-1384943">sever his ties</a> with them in order to protect his own.

From being co-stars on Uncle Samsik to planning a life together, they&rsquo;ve come a long way, and there&rsquo;s nothing stopping them from being happy. So when the actor was asked about his feelings ahead of his supposedly upcoming marriage, he kept it brief, funny, and redirected the conversation to the project he was promoting, film Pavane.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Byun Yo Ha reveals thoughts on his relationship with Tiffany Young</strong></p>

<p>The couple, which is said to have first started dating following the completion of their drama, Disney+&rsquo;s Uncle Samsik, where they played lovers. On Thursday, appearing before the media at the press conference for his next work, his first since confirming his relationship with Tiffany Young, actor Byun Yo Han was caught off guard by a question on his impending marriage. As shared by Herald Muse, the star was thrown off by a &lsquo;light&rsquo; query about his feelings ahead of his nuptials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noting that it was not at all a lighthearted question, the actor responded, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly why you should watch Pavane. Giving love, receiving love, what love truly is&hellip; Through this film, I want to communicate the message of love and meet viewers around the world.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;As many people have supported us, I will live well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byun Yo Han was successfully able to swerve away from the talk about his marriage to his latest project and then let out a breath of air in relief as the attendees giggled. He was cheered on by fellow cast members, Go Ah Sung and Moon Sang Min.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/girls-generations-yoona-reveals-taking-career-break-after-king-the-land-to-recharge-physically-plans-to-go-full-throttle-this-year-1366028">Girls&rsquo; Generation</a> member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/tiffany-young-breaks-silence-on-byun-yo-han-relationship-says-boyfriend-cheers-me-on-without-holding-back-1399800">shared her gratitude for the people&rsquo;s attention</a> to her personal life during the press conference for the reality show, Veiled Cup. She said that those around her have cheered on her work without holding back, hinting at her boyfriend&rsquo;s support.</p>

<p>The two confirmed that they were dating in December 2025 and clarified that, though they are meeting with good intentions, their marriage plans had not been set in stone so far.</p>

All about final couples in dating show]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/765812812_singles-inferno-5.webp"></img><p>Single&rsquo;s Inferno 5, the latest season of the popular Korean Netflix dating series, aired its last episodes on February 10, 2026. After premiering on January 20, the show released 10 episodes before the last week, where two more parts were dropped. Many were curious about how many final pairings would be formed owing to the 15-contestant lineup. In the end, a whopping 5 couples walked out together, walking hand-in-hand, from the Inferno to the Paradise in real life.</p>

<p><strong>Single&rsquo;s Inferno 5 final pairings&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>With a total of 12 episodes released across four weeks, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/11-k-drama-and-ott-releases-to-check-out-in-january-2026-can-this-love-be-translated-to-singles-inferno-season-5-1399566">Single&rsquo;s Inferno 5</a> invited the attention of plenty. Every week, the choices of the participants were discussed widely online, gathering support and criticism alike. With the finale on Wednesday, the final couples walking out together were revealed as follows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Kim Min Gee and Song Seung Il: </strong>Even with so many ups and downs to their relationship, the real Queen of this season walked in arms with the man she had her eyes set on right from the get-go. Even with many moments of them knocking on other doors, the couple came out on the other side happy and together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Park Hee Sun and Lim Su Been:</strong> The most would-they would-they-not pairing in the Inferno, viewers remained at the edge of their seats till the last moments. As Su Been contemplated his choices and Hee Sun enjoyed her time with Lee Sung Hun, the two chose each other in the end.</p>

<p><strong>3. Lee Joo Young and Kim Jae Jin: </strong>While many tried to sway her heart, Joo Young stayed true to her heart and went with the hilarious oddball, dancer Jae Jin. They were the perfect and most stable fit among all the contestants on the show.</p>

<p><strong>4. Kim Go Eun and Woo Sung Min: </strong>With the attention of three men at her feet, Go Eun had a tough choice to make. She grabbed the one who gave her peace and did not confuse her, going for the dedicated Sung Min after everything that went down with Jo I Geon.</p>

<p><strong>5. Choi Mina Sue and Lee Sung Hun: </strong>Having the highest screentime across episodes and inviting the most polarizing views of them all, Choi Mina Sue was juggling 4 to 5 men at one point, trying to talk with everyone and stick to her instincts, much like the premise of the show expected. In the end, the comfortable vibes with Lee Sung Hun, aka Samuel Lee, won her heart.</p>

On February 4, reports surfaced of the star planning to marry his longtime girlfriend in a private ceremony this year. Earlier, it was believed that his partner was a non-celebrity, whose identity was kept secret, but the latest reports have revealed her to be none other than fellow actor Cha Jung Won. The couple is expected to marry this summer, with some rumors even suggesting a July date. However, the two sides have denied there being any truth to these plans.</p>

<p><strong>Ha Jung Woo and Cha Jung Won&rsquo;s dating and marriage plans debunked</strong></p>

<p>The two actors have reportedly been dating after first meeting in 2020 and developing a strong bond later. The two are said to have met as only colleagues, later getting close by supporting each other. They have an 11-year age difference and have been seriously thinking about marriage for a while now, with concrete plans seemingly being made since last year. With their busy schedules, the couple has yet to lock down a marriage date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Wednesday, as per Dispatch reportage, Ha Jung Woo and Cha Jung Won will &ldquo;likely begin preparing for the wedding while keeping an eye on the progress of his film shoot.&rdquo; Another report cited the Tunnel star&rsquo;s father, but he later clarified that he only shared that he was unaware of the matter and instead wished to congratulate the son if he was planning his nuptials.</p>

<p>Clarifying an update on the postponement of a July wedding at the Shilla Hotel in Jung-gu, Seoul, Chosun Ilbo has shared a response from the rumored bride-to-be&rsquo;s agency, Saram Entertainment, &quot;Actor Cha Jung Won is currently dating actor Ha Jung Woo. However, marriage rumors are unfounded.&quot; Meanwhile, the actor&rsquo;s management label, Walk House Company, said to OSEN, &quot;It is true that actor Ha Jung Woo is in a relationship, but the marriage rumors are untrue. There are no plans for marriage, including this summer or July.&quot; Neither of the teams commented on when their artists started dating or how it all began.&nbsp;</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1470099793_bts.webp"></img><p>BTS is K-pop royalty, and once again marking their mark in the world of Korean music, the team is seemingly taking a big step for their Gwanghwamun Square show. Reports have surfaced on Wednesday that the septet is expected to walk a route famously taken by Kings in the past and holds great historical significance. As of right now, the rumors only stem from Korean media coverage, with Chosun Ilbo sharing it as a possibility. Official confirmations are awaited from the group&rsquo;s team.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS to walk the royal path to meet fans and shoot content for ARIRANG comeback livestream</strong></p>

<p>As per reports on February 4, BTS is expected to take the historic route from Geungjeongmun to Heungnyemun to Gwanghwamun and the plaza as the opening scene for their performance at the esteemed Gwanghwamun Square, which will be broadcast to millions across the world. The walk is expected to be pre-recorded or partially livestreamed to the BTS ARMY on March 21.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously undertaken by Korean Kings for their meetings and interactions with their subjects, BTS may follow the famed &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Road/King&rsquo;s Path&rsquo; to interact with their fans. It is known that the plaza in front of Gwanghwamun Gate, known as the &quot;wolgae&quot;, was restored in 2023 after being destroyed a century ago. Originally built in 1866, the route would imply the &lsquo;return of the King of K-pop&rsquo; if this becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Just one day prior, it was announced that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-livestream-arirang-comeback-for-global-fans-bts-the-return-documentary-planned-for-march-27-1400416">BTS THE COMEBACK LIVE: ARIRANG</a> live will be streamed on March 21 at 8 pm KST (4:30 pm IST) on Netflix.

The event will be followed by a feature-length documentary called BTS: THE RETURN, which will be released subsequently on March 27 and cover the making of the record.</p>

<p>Following the release, the group will set out on a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-adds-2-concert-dates-to-arirang-world-tour-as-pre-sale-sells-out-4-million-pre-orders-surpass-4-million-1400143">world tour</a> across 34 cities and 81 stops, starting with the debut show at Goyang Stadium.</p>

In a refreshing and welcome change, amid all the stigma around K-pop idols&rsquo; dating lives, she has been upfront about her past experiences and included them in her songwriting. During her latest appearance on Alex Cooper&#39;s Call Her Daddy podcast, she spoke about how in the past, the fear of being caught made her buy older women outfits so she could dress in them before going to her boyfriend&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p><strong>Dating as a K-pop star is tough and this time, Ros&eacute; is laying it bare</strong></p>

<p>Opening up about the many times that she has had to change her appearance in order to fool fans that may be lurking around or even paparazzi keeping a track of her actions, the singer shared with the host how she would keep a big set of disguise clothes at her place. Ros&eacute; shared, &ldquo;I got a wig. A black curly wig, like a short one. And then I studied how older people&mdash;like elderly women&mdash;would dress on the street. I&rsquo;d be like, Okay, they wear that kind of skirt, those shoes, that kind of bag. I would study it, order it, and then dress up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being paranoid about being caught dating, she turned to these methods to keep herself hidden away from the lenses and went &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; with it. On being asked whether she would go to outside dates dressed like that, the 28-year-old revealed that they were stuck at home mostly because she could not be spotted outside, &ldquo;I would go to his house like that, because we couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I traveled that way just in case somebody saw me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eventually her obsession with dressing up came to a point that she had a section of just grandma clothes at her home. She clarified that she had gotten rid of it since. Revealing whether her partner would also dress up or disguise himself, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/katseye-and-blackpinks-rose-earn-first-ever-grammy-nominations-check-out-who-theyre-up-against-1398300">APT.</a> hitmaker shared that her boyfriend would also become more &lsquo;grandpa-ish&rsquo; but did not have to wear a wig unlike herself who even learned how to walk like old people.</p>

This Monday, online reports suggested that a new free concert will be held by the K-pop juggernauts as their official return to the stage at the historical Gwanghwamun Square (Gwanghwamun Plaza). In response to the claims, BIGHIT MUSIC has stated that discussions are still ongoing and that official confirmations will be made later.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BTS contemplates plans to take over iconic Korean locations for album release</strong></p>

<p>Amid reports of holding a free concert at Gwanghwamun Square, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-confirms-new-album-release-on-march-20-wipes-off-instagram-with-group-celebrating-new-year-at-rms-home-1399552">BTS</a>&rsquo; agency said to Newsen, &quot;We are currently discussing it, and an official announcement will be made once the location and schedule are finalized.&quot; It is being said that the company has applied to the National Heritage Administration for permission to use and film not just Gwanghwamun Square but also the historically important Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Sungnyemun Gate area.

He is an undisputed King of the list, having ruled for numerous consecutive years, and only a few other K-pop stars have occasionally surpassed him, only for the singer to be back at the number one spot once again in the following month. The start of 2026 is no different, as the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-announces-34-city-world-tour-starting-april-2026-india-missing-from-list-with-more-concerts-planned-1399884">BTS</a> member was once again crowned the leader of the list of brand reputation rankings for individual K-pop boy group members.</p>

V grabbed the sixth rank, J-Hope the 10th, SUGA the 20th, and finally, leader RM the 26th. Interestingly, 5 out of 7 members of the team managed to be in the top 10, even though the group is yet to release any new music since the end of their military break in June 2025. Six months on, they continue to win the favor of fans.</p>

<p>Unmissable from the reputation list is BIGBANG&rsquo;s leader G-Dragon, who has nabbed the second spot on the rankings amid his ongoing tour and year-end award show appearances, as well as new concert announcements. EXO&rsquo;s Baekhyun has impressed with his fourth spot standing amid solo fan meetings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wanna One&rsquo;s Kang Daniel, NU&rsquo;EST and Wanna One&rsquo;s Hwang Minhyun, the former of whom revealed his military enlistment plans and the latter who returned after completing his service, have both grabbed the interest of fans. Meanwhile, TWS&rsquo;s Dohoon, whose cuteness Overdrive challenge with fellow members, has taken over the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Duo&rsquo;s Gaeko and Kim Su Mi cautiously share updates on their divorce</strong></p>

<p>In a shocking revelation to the fans of the couple and especially the Dynamic Duo&rsquo;s admirers, the two have announced their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/t-aras-jiyeon-and-baseballer-hwang-jae-gyun-file-for-divorce-mediation-after-2-years-of-marriage-1352120">divorce</a>, after seemingly living a happy and fulfilling marriage for the past almost a decade and a half. The rapper took to his social media account to share a short letter.<br />
&ldquo;Hello, this is Gaeko.<br />
I&rsquo;m sharing some personal news with a cautious heart.<br />
After many long and thoughtful conversations, we decided last year to end our relationship as a married couple while continuing to respect each other&rsquo;s lives.<br />
As parents, we will take on shared responsibility for raising our children and continue to fulfill our roles to the end.<br />
We kindly ask for your warm understanding and support.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kim Su Mi wrote, &ldquo;As this is a private matter, I am being cautious. We decided to conclude our marital relationship as a choice that respects each other&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; She added her request to understand this time and advised people not to raise speculations or spread rumors. &ldquo;Rather than excessive interest or hasty interpretations, I ask that you watch over us with a little warmth,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Kim Yoon Sung, aka Gaeko, and Kim Su Mi got married back in May 2011 and have welcomed two kids that they continue to raise as a family. They seem to have settled for joint custody of their children.

They are known to have filmed the music video at the end of last year, with photoshoots for the album cover and more seemingly being done soon after. A large-scale promotional cycle is expected for this return to the music scene.</p>

<p>The drop of the DEADLINE album comes over seven months since the release of their last digital single, JUMP, which met the world on July 11, 2025. The group has since been on a world tour, which is all set to conclude on January 26, 2026, in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-adds-2-shows-to-deadline-world-tour-across-singapore-and-hong-kong-know-new-schedule-1397004">Hong Kong&rsquo;s Kai Tak Stadium</a>.</p>

<p>After much speculation and unconfirmed rumors that have riddled the comeback of the girl group amid their ongoing world tour, the announcement comes as a necessary respite for fans. Previously reported to be <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">releasing in November</a>, which was then changed to&nbsp;the end of 2025, following a revelation from YG Entertainment founder Yang Hyun Suk himself, the record was pushed further to seemingly improve its quality. Now, the plans have been confirmed for the new album as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/boyfriend-on-demand-first-look-blackpinks-jisoo-and-seo-in-guk-are-each-others-undoing-in-romance-k-drama-1399734">Jisoo</a>, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-and-blackpinks-jennie-make-unexpected-cameos-at-2026-golden-globe-awards-heres-how-1399840">Jennie</a>, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa continue their world tour.</p>

The actor and singer couple have welcomed the birth of their second daughter, as revealed by the management label on Wednesday. The newborn and the mother are said to be in recovery as of now. No further reactions were shared.</p>

<p><strong>Jo Jung Suk and Gummy become parents to their second daughter</strong></p>

<p>As reported by Ten Asia, the couple shared the happy news with their fans and well-wishers via their team. JAM Entertainment has revealed that the star couple, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/weak-hero-class-2-jo-jung-suk-steals-show-with-memorable-cameo-know-how-he-flipped-switch-in-park-ji-hoon-starrer-1384756">Jo Jung Suk</a> and Gummy, have welcomed a new family member. Confirming the birth of their second child, a daughter, on January 14 local time, the agency said, &quot;We are pleased to deliver the happy news that a new member has joined the family.&rdquo; They added that the songstress and the newborn baby are in good health after the birth and are recovering from it, &quot;[they are] recovering peacefully with the love and care of their family. We kindly ask for warm support and encouragement for the couple. We extend our sincere thanks to everyone who has shown heartfelt interest and love,&rdquo; they shared, expressing happiness over the joyful news.</p>

<p><strong>About Gummy and Jo Jung Suk&#39;s relationship</strong></p>

<p>The couple previously confirmed that they were <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jo-jung-suk-and-gummy-expecting-second-child-5-years-after-birth-of-daughter-report-1394844">expecting their second child</a> back in July 2025, resulting in a flurry of excitement from their fans who congratulated the duo. The update was also met with good wishes from the industry, who learned of it 4 to 5 months into the pregnancy. Earlier during his appearance on My Little Old Boy, the actor revealed how it was during the filming for his film My Daughter Is a Zombie in Haenam when the singer called her to ask if he wanted to have a second child.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two got married on October 8, 2018, in a private family ceremony after dating for 5 years. Jo Jung Suk and Gummy have a daughter who was born back in 2020. With this new happy addition, the duo has grown into a family of four. While the name of their first child has not been revealed publicly yet, both parents are known to dote on their kid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amid all the excitement, Indian fans of BTS who have long been waiting for any update on the group&rsquo;s visit to the country may have to wait longer. After member V hinted at the team coming to the South Asian land for their tour stop, there is no Indian city among the 34 names announced for the upcoming tour so far. However, all hope may not be lost as the poster for the stops also revealed that more dates will be announced later, including stops in Japan, the Middle East, and other places.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the group is also gearing up to release a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-confirms-new-album-release-on-march-20-wipes-off-instagram-with-group-celebrating-new-year-at-rms-home-1399552">new album on March 20, 2026</a>, as previously announced. It would be their first new album in over three years and nine months. Called their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-announces-14-track-5th-album-all-we-know-so-far-about-release-pre-order-world-tour-schedule-and-rumored-dua-lipa-collab-1399652">5th regular album</a> as of now, the full-length record has not yet revealed its name to the public, with many even speculating that it would be an eponymous release for the group, marking their historic return. With the tour drop, it seems only more plausible due to the absence of a tour name.</p>

On January 11 local time, the much-awaited <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/2026-golden-globes-selena-gomez-makes-1st-red-carpet-appearance-as-wife-with-benny-blanco-jennifer-lawrence-ariana-grande-bring-a-game-1399826">2026 Golden Globe Awards</a> were held at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, USA. In attendance were Lisa and SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Joshua, who represented K-pop at the ceremony. But fellow member Jennie and Bangtan Sonyeondan were also a part of the event in their own ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the ceremony, fans noticed that BTS&rsquo; Dynamite, the song released about 6 years ago, still found its way to the masses, especially all the celebrities attending the Golden Globes. The group&rsquo;s first-ever track to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 chart&rsquo;s No. 1 is still relevant and very much loved by fans as well as award ceremonies, as one could see. It was played during the announcement of the Best Podcast award at the Golden Globe Awards. During the broadcast, fans could see Amy Poehler getting up to receive her trophy for her podcast, Good Hang with Amy Poehler, as it grabbed the win.</p>

<p>BLACKPINK member Jennie may not be at the event in person, but her music made its way to the celebratory evening. The 2025 released song, Like JENNIE, which became viral for its catchy tunes and trendy hook steps, was running in the background as Jennifer Lopez presented an award at the 83rd Golden Globes. While she was announcing the winner for Best Male Actor Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, the song rang in, showcasing its unbeatable stronghold on the general public.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lisa makes historical Golden Globes debut</strong></p>

<p>Lalisa Manobal, the Thai BLACKPINK member, officially became the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/83rd-golden-globes-blackpinks-lisa-seventeens-joshua-and-lee-byung-hun-bring-the-glam-pics-1399827">first K-pop act to present an award</a> at the Golden Globes. She took hold of the red carpet with a stunning black sheer piece, which she later changed to wear a grey-silver dress while presenting. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/2026-golden-globe-awards-priyanka-chopra-fixes-nick-jonas-tie-on-red-carpet-stuns-in-strapless-blue-dior-gown-1399824">Priyanka Chopra</a> joined her as the two giggled away, announcing the Best Actor in a TV Series-Drama Award.</p>

<p>Korean actor Lee Byung Hun was also a part of the guestlist following his meaningful contribution to works like Squid Game 3 and KPop Demon Hunters in 2025.</p>

On January 11, a notice from his agency informed the fans of his plans to begin his enlistment on February 9, 2026. The period of his military service is expected to be for one year and six months. Having previously decided to step away from active promotions with his team MONSTA X, the singer has reportedly undergone rehabilitation, which allows him to participate in an upcoming group concert in their home country of South Korea.</p>

<p><strong>I.M. locks military enlistment date</strong></p>

<p>Starship Entertainment has announced plans for I.M.&rsquo;s military enlistment a month later. They also added, &quot;We are pleased to inform you that I.M. will be participating in the 2025 MONSTA X WORLD TOUR [THE X: NEXUS] Seoul concert.&quot; The same will be held just a week before his enlistment. The two days of the show, January 30 and February 1, will mark his last team activity before he takes a hiatus. As per the standard regulations, he is expected to be discharged from service in the fourth quarter of 2027. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A separate notice from his own team spoke about his plans to enter basic military training, which will be followed by his military service lasting 18 months in total.<br />
&ldquo;Hello, this is Team I.M.<br />
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all the fans who continue to support I.M.<br />
We are writing to provide an update regarding his upcoming military service.<br />
I.M will enlist at a recruit training center on February 9, 2026, to undergo basic military training, after which he will serve as an active-duty soldier in the Army.<br />
No official event will be held on the day of his enlistment. Since the enlistment ceremony is an event attended by many service members and their families, we kindly ask for your understanding and cooperation in refraining from visiting the site to ensure safety and maintain order.<br />
We ask for your continued love and support until I.M faithfully completes his service and returns in good health.<br />
Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With I.M.&rsquo;s military enlistment and discharge, all six members of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/throwback-when-monsta-x-unknowingly-helped-seventeen-exit-escape-room-with-100-points-on-karaoke-watch-1337822">MONSTA X</a> would have completed their service, with the only leader, Shownu, having served as a public service worker and the rest as active duty soldiers. The group is expected to reunite at the end of 2027 as a full group, ending their military era.</p>

The former co-stars on the period thriller K-drama Uncle Samsik have been dating for a while, and it is believed they&rsquo;re headed towards marriage.

Sweet Home actor Lee Jin Wook is reportedly set to star alongside her as the male lead. Her agency later confirmed receiving the script and reviewing it, but has not shared the decision.</p>

<p>Shin Min Ah is gladly not shying away from romance roles, and there&rsquo;s nothing more that we as fans could ask for, except maybe a romantic role with now-husband Kim Woo Bin. She is said to be in talks for a new romance K-drama called Wed Thurs Fri with actor Lee Jin Wook, who was last seen in Beyond the Bar, alongside Jung Chaeyeon. The actress&rsquo;s management label, AM Entertainment, later shared, &ldquo;She received an offer and is positively reviewing it,&rdquo; with the actor&rsquo;s side yet to comment on the reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wed Thurs Fri is said to be based around a restaurant which only functions on the three days of the week. It will aim to showcase the love story between the head chef at the eatery and a woman who finds a deep connection with the place. If confirmed, it would be Shin Min Ah&rsquo;s first project post-marriage. She is currently working on Disney+&#39;s The Remarried Empress, in which she stars in the titular character&rsquo;s role alongside Lee Jong Sok, Ju Ji Hoon, and Lee Se Young. The filming for the show began in mid-2025 and is expected to wrap up in the coming months.</p>

<p>The news came after the couple&rsquo;s romantic Eiffel Tower proposal photos were leaked online and then taken down by the studio that shot them in Paris earlier this year. The actor had then clarified that the images were taken in April 2024 for his lady love&rsquo;s birthday and were not from the official engagement.</p>

While it is not known when the group will set out for a global takeover, member V previously teased that an India stop may be on the map after all, sending their desi fans into a meltdown. Previously, J-Hope also confirmed that the group had begun practising choreography for their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-head-back-to-us-for-filming-new-songs-music-video-comeback-album-likely-to-release-in-march-2026-1396317">new song</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, just as the clock struck 12 am on December 31 and January 1 began, the whole of BTS&rsquo; Instagram was cleared off. Over 1700 posts were archived to start the new chapter in the group&rsquo;s music career. Not only that, but the group&rsquo;s overall social media was changed, with their Weverse and Twitter profiles undergoing a visible move to a black and white theme, no sign of their photos in sight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seven boys were at leader RM&rsquo;s new house and decided to conduct an impromptu livestream to ring in the New Year with their fans. Sitting on one big couch, bickering and sharing their hope for a fruitful 2026, they bowed their heads in true Korean tradition and wished for a successful music comeback.&nbsp;</p>

The two managed to find each other at the perfect time in their lives and fall in love, then get married and have a handsome son who everyone agrees is a stunner already. Their path to finding each other was extremely heartwarming, and the couple maintains their stance that they did not date while filming <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/my-wife-hyun-bin-blushes-at-son-ye-jin-mention-as-fans-call-actress-his-biggest-souvenir-from-crash-landing-on-you-1395364">Crash Landing on You</a>. Speaking on Jung Jae Hyung&rsquo;s YouTube show, Fairy Jae Hyung, Hyun Bin dished on whether he and his now-wife would reunite for a third project.</p>

<p><strong>Hyun Bin reveals if he and Son Ye Jin were dating while filming Crash Landing on You</strong></p>

<p>Jung Jae Hyung asked <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hyun-bin-was-uninterested-in-marriage-until-meeting-son-ye-jin-heres-why-actor-didnt-expect-to-become-father-soon-1371415">Hyun Bin</a> how he and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/son-ye-jin-reveals-hyun-bins-face-on-instagram-for-first-time-since-marriage-after-making-blue-dragon-history-1398640">Son Ye Jin</a> were able to portray their romance-filled eyes without having already been in love during the shooting of the cross-border K-drama. &ldquo;I truly believed it was love,&rdquo; Jung Jae Hyung remarked. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t deliver that kind of acting unless there&rsquo;s genuine emotion behind it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not caving into the questions, Hyun Bin clarified, &ldquo;No, it [our dating] started after filming ended.&rdquo; He went on to share how, despite working together on the film The Negotiation, they did not have many chances to film face-to-face scenes due to the nature of the story and their characters. &ldquo;We filmed mostly in separate spaces. We only saw each other briefly during meals or monitoring,&rdquo; he shared.</p>

<p>When asked if there was a specific moment that made him fall for Son Ye Jin, Hyun Bin melted all hearts with his response, &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t one defining moment,&rdquo; he shared while pondering. &ldquo;It just happened over time&mdash;like water slowly soaking into clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Would Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin want to work together?</strong></p>

<p>The mom-of-one previously shared how she&rsquo;d be more than happy to get back into working mode with her husband, with whom she recently won the Popularity Award. Meanwhile, the actor was of the same mindset, ready to get back on set with his former co-star and now his wife, but instead of going for another love story, he seems to be looking for something more bold. &ldquo;A story about a married couple whose relationship suddenly falls apart could be interesting,&rdquo; he quipped.</p>

<p>Imagining the kind of project they would agree on, he name-dropped Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s 2005 film, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith.&nbsp;</p>

While originally, best friend EXO&rsquo;s D.O. was supposed to sing the congratulatory song, his commitments at the Melon Music Awards kept his visit to only a few minutes. Meanwhile, singer Car, the Garden (Cha Jung Won), took on the responsibility to sing Romantic Sunday from the bride&rsquo;s K-drama, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple&rsquo;s friends including industry mates like BTS member V, Zo In Sung, Nam Joo Hyuk, Kim Taeri, Uhm Jung Hwa, Ahn Bo Hyun, Ryu Jun Yeol, Gong Hyo Jin, Jin Kyung, Lee Byung Hun, Go Doo Rim, Lee Se Young, Yoon Kyung Ho, Lim Ju Hwan, and Yoo Hae Jin, were spotted among th <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-woo-bin-and-shin-min-ahs-wedding-bts-v-exos-d-o-nam-joo-hyuk-kim-taeri-and-more-attend-1399304">guest list</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Heirs, Genie, Make a Wish, and The Glory screenwriter Kim Eun Sook, as well as Na Young Seok PD, and Our Blues writer Noh Hee Kyung, were seen at the ceremony, according to reports. The couple announced their decision to get married back in November, after dating for 10 years.&nbsp;</p>

The couple rang in their ceremony on December 20, at the Shilla Hotel in Seoul, South Korea, in the presence of their close friends, industry mates, and family only. The two dropped their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-woo-bin-and-shin-min-ah-star-in-first-couple-photo-ahead-of-wedding-grateful-for-warm-blessings-1399291">first-ever couple photo</a> this morning from a pre-wedding shoot done a few days ago, shared by their agency AM Entertainment, thanking the fans for their support and asking for their blessing on their new journey.</p>

<p>The duo had earlier created a handwritten invite for their guests, with the two contributing to the words and the drawing each, making it a very personal invitation for all their near and dear ones. As the time for the ceremony came close, one by one, cars filled with celebrities and paparazzi, ready to capture them, appeared near the venue, alongside a multitude of fans who had arrived to lend their support to the power couple.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kim Woo Bin and Shin Min Ah&rsquo;s wedding guest list</strong></p>

<p>BTS member V made a surprise entry, with no one knowing whose friend he was from the duo and how they had gotten so close, earning him a wedding invite. However, the most shocking of them all was when EXO member Doh Kyung Soo arrived. D.O. was seen at the 2025 Melon Music Awards red carpet with his teammates just a while ago and then took over an hour&rsquo;s drive to his best friend&rsquo;s wedding spot. He arrived for a brief time, leaving quickly after meeting the bride and groom, in true bestie spirit. He is said to have been sad originally on learning that the MMA and the wedding were scheduled for the same day. The singer soon returned to the awards event to sing and perform a new EXO song as well as take over the stage with Growl, Love Shot, and The Eve dances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The host of the evening, model, comedian, and actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-kwang-soo-to-host-bestie-kim-woo-bins-wedding-to-shin-min-ah-this-weekend-in-seoul-1399230">Lee Kwang Soo</a>, who is also a part of the same friends group as D.O. and Kim Woo Bin, as well as their co-star on the reality shows Green Bean, Red Bean, and GBRB: Joy Pops Laugh Pops, arrived with a bunch of notes in his hand, prepping for the big day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other industry friends attending the ceremony include actors Nam Joo Hyuk, Kim Taeri, Uhm Jung Hwa, Ahn Bo Hyun, Ryu Jun Yeol, Gong Hyo Jin, Jin Kyung, Lee Byung Hun, Go Doo Rim, Lee Se Young, Yoon Kyung Ho, Lim Ju Hwan, and Yoo Hae Jin, among others.</p>

<p>The non-actor invitees included The Heirs, Genie, Make a Wish, and The Glory screenwriter Kim Eun Sook, as well as Na Young Seok PD, who created the GBRB series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not known so far whether other Hyung Squad members, Cha Tae Hyun, Zo In Sung, and Bae Sung Woo, also attended.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>All about Kim Woo Bin and Shin Min Ah&#39;s wedding ceremony</strong></p>

<p>The ceremony, which was initially supposed to be held at 6 pm KST, was then seemingly moved to 7 pm KST. Aiming to accommodate their dozens of friends and family, acquaintances, and more, who they&rsquo;ve acquired over the years in the industry, the couple chose a classic, massive venue for their nuptials. Other celebrities who have previously wed at the spot include Jun Ji Hyun and Choi Joon Hyuk, Jang Dong Gun and Ko So Young, Yoo Jae Suk and Na Kyung Eun, Jeon Do Yeon and Kang Shi Kyu, as well as Song Joong Ki and Song Hye Kyo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple that first met on the sets of a brand shoot and dated for a decade before announcing their decision to marry last month.</p>

A black and white snap, it managed to perfectly capture their chic essence as a couple. Snow could be seen falling down on them as they walked ahead on a snow-clad ground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dressed in an all-white bridal look, Shin Min Ah can be seen holding big, bulbous flowers while her hair cascades down her back over the two-piece corsetted ensemble. On the other hand, the former model, Kim Woo Bin, has a happy glint in his eyes, dressed in a fitted black blazer over lighter pants and a white shirt peeking from underneath, as he walks right ahead. The duo is holding their hands, hidden behind the actress, in a rare PDA moment.</p>

<p>Previously, Kim Woo Bin and Shin Min Ah penned handwritten invites to their near and dear ones, welcoming them to their evening ceremony, showing their dedication. After dating for 10 years, the two actors will tie the knot today evening in the presence of their loved ones.&nbsp;</p>

What started as an unexpected meet-up at one of their many advertisement shoots soon turned into a romance that surpassed all fairytales. Ahead of their long-awaited wedding on December 20, 2025, we&rsquo;re taking a look at the many highlights of their relationship and sharing all the details we have of their nuptials.</p>

<p><strong>January 2015: First meeting</strong><br />
Back then, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/is-shin-min-ah-pregnant-with-her-and-kim-woo-bins-first-child-agency-reacts-amid-marriage-announcement-1398594">Shin Min Ah</a> had a major hit like My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho, co-starring Lee Seung Gi, under her belt, alongside several other good projects in the pipeline. She was on the cusp of another superhit rom-com, Oh My Venus, with So Ji Sub, and all the attention of the world on her next steps. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-woo-bin-pens-sweet-note-to-fans-after-announcing-marriage-to-shin-min-ah-starting-family-with-my-partner-1398583">Kim Woo Bin</a> was a household name following his appearance in The Heirs, in which his chemistry with Park Shin Hye as well as his bond with Lee Min Ho became the talk of the town. The two were chosen for an ad shoot by the famed brand Giordano. K-pop Herald quoted them saying, &ldquo;Despite their packed schedule, the two stars actively took part in the shoot so we really enjoyed shooting.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Feb-May 2015: Courting&nbsp;</strong><br />
The two are said to have approached their relationship carefully while promotions for the brand remained a constant in their lives. After getting interested in February of the year, they seemingly began dating in May as reported by Dispatch. It is believed that Kim Woo Bin would carefully plan his dates with his lady love by even pushing back his filming schedule to match hers. He would pick her up from her home for sweet nighttime dates.</p>

<p><strong>July 2015: Confirmation</strong><br />
The two did not take long to be open about their relationship, and by a month&rsquo;s time, their agencies had confirmed that they were dating. &ldquo;We have confirmed with [Shin Min Ah] that the two are currently dating,&rdquo; said her side, while his checked with the actor before replying similarly.</p>

<p><strong>March 2016: PDA</strong><br />
While not too big on public expressions of love, it was Shin Min Ah who made her first move for her man by sending over a beautiful support food truck for all the staff and actors on the set. A buffet style menu awaited those in attendance. It was belatedly revealed that the actress had decided to treat her boyfriend&rsquo;s support staff, who initially believed that it was he who brought in the food truck.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>May 2017: Health diagnosis&nbsp;</strong><br />
On May 24, Sidus HQ shared that Kim Woo Bin had been diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer. &ldquo;Thankfully, they said it&rsquo;s not too late to receive treatment, so he has started radiation therapy and is taking medication,&rdquo; shared his agency. Shin Min Ah stood by him with short and firm words of encouragement, &ldquo;I am currently helping Kim Woo-bin get better while he is under treatment.&rdquo; The two put their careers on hold to focus on his health while the actor received multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>January 2019: Overseas dates</strong><br />
The duo had gone through much together and continued to stay by each other&rsquo;s side. While they did plan on returning to their work, they took some time off to head to Australia for some cozy dates. They were spotted by unassuming fans who took photos of them on quiet outings away from the spotlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>August 2019: Return favor</strong><br />
Kim Woo Bin sent a coffee truck to the set of Chief of Staff season 2 filming as a supportive action for his girlfriend. His sweet message made all the difference for the fans of the two, &ldquo;I support all the cast and crew of Chief of Staff, especially Shin Min Ah. I support you a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>February 2020: Same agency</strong><br />
After shockingly leaving his label, Sidus HQ, after eight years of being together, Kim Woo Bin joined the AM Entertainment family, which also housed Shin Min Ah.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>September 2020: Return to work</strong><br />
With the actor deciding to get back to acting, his lover was right by his side, offering warm words. &ldquo;Since we have the same career and we support each other, we say, &lsquo;Hwaiting!&rsquo; to each other. I also hope Kim Woo Bin does well since he&rsquo;s making his return. We&rsquo;re cheering each other on,&rdquo; she said as per News1 during the Diva film interview.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>April 2021: Same show</strong><br />
While he had only done one film since his comeback, he was gearing up for a K-drama return with her as a fellow lead. Though the two did not star as romantic partners on Our Blues, their presence in the same show offered comfort to their fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>November 2025: Marriage announcement</strong><br />
The two <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/shin-min-ah-and-kim-woo-bin-to-get-married-in-december-after-10-years-of-dating-1398579">decided to get married</a> after 10 years of being together, as shared by their agency, AM Entertainment. Kim Woo Bin shared a letter revealing his plans to his admirers and asked for their warm support.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>December 2025: Wedding</strong><br />
The two are all set to get married on December 20, at the Shilla Hotel in Seoul, South Korea. It is known that only family and friends will be in attendance, with longtime pal <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-kwang-soo-to-host-bestie-kim-woo-bins-wedding-to-shin-min-ah-this-weekend-in-seoul-1399230">Lee Kwang Soo leading the ceremony</a> as the MC.</p>

Caught in the moment, Suzy appeared staring down at her booted feet while a very animated V spoke to her in pout, possibly directing their next pose. The final nail came with their last photo, where the two loudly smiled at each other, with her hiding behind her palm as he gazed at her.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old also shared selfies with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/park-bo-gum-receives-surprise-of-lifetime-from-bts-v-during-the-seasons-last-show-id-love-to-shoot-1394957">Park Bo Gum</a> and the members of team TWS in images, smiling and posing with smiles on their faces, showing the strong bond among the stars. The two actors have featured together as the leads in Wonderland, which became the 32-year-old actor&rsquo;s first movie post military discharge. They have remained close since, often seen hanging out at events.</p>

Lee Kwang Soo&rsquo;s management label King Kong by Starship shared a short confirmation with Celeb Media, &ldquo;Lee Kwang Soo will be the MC for Kim Woo Bin and Shin Min Ah&rsquo;s wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Hyung Squad expected to reunite at Kim Woo Bin&rsquo;s wedding</strong></p>

<p>Lee Kwang Soo and Kim Woo Bin are part of a bigger group of friends called the &lsquo;Hyung Squad&rsquo;, which also comprises actors Doh Kyung Soo, Zo In Sung, Bae Sung Woo, Cha Tae Hyun, and Lim Joo Hwan. The former two became friends during their modeling days and have been close since. They often hang out together and support each other&rsquo;s projects.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shin Min Ah and Kim Woo Bin met on the set of an endorsement shoot back in 2015. The two have continued to date and remain low-key while leading successful acting careers, and even moving to the same agency, AM Entertainment. After 10 years of dating, the couple is set to tie the knot in the presence of their friends and family this weekend.</p>

<p>While other guests&rsquo; attendance is yet to be confirmed, it is known that D.O. would be unable to be present, due to his appearance alongside EXO members at the MMA awards happening on the same day.&nbsp;</p>

The singer-actress announced her plans to marry longtime boyfriend, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/who-is-rado-black-eyed-pilseungs-one-half-and-man-behind-stayc-dating-apinks-bomi-1298546">Rado</a>, whom she has been dating for the past nine years. On December 18, a JTBC report of the two tying the knot surfaced on the internet post which the Apink member took to her official fancafe to share the update with her fans via a handwritten letter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Apink&rsquo;s Bomi confirms marriage plans with former Black Eyed Pilseung&rsquo;s Rado</strong></p>

<p>In a note shared by her agency, WITH US Entertainment, the 32-year-old&rsquo;s decision to marry her beau was shared. It reads, &ldquo;We are sharing our official position regarding the update reported today about Yoon Bomi. She is set to marry her cherished partner, who has been by her side for a long time, in May of next year. We ask for your warm support for the couple as they embark on this new chapter of their lives.<br />
Even after marriage, Yoon Bomi plans to continue her steady activities without change as a member of Apink, as an actress, and as an entertainer. She will return with a more mature and responsible image to repay the fans who have always supported her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similarly, the to-be-groom&rsquo;s side also shared their confirmation, &ldquo;Our chief producer Rado (real name Song Joo Young) has met a cherished partner and will be getting married in May of next year. Even after marriage, Rado plans to continue to devote himself to music as the representative producer of High Up Entertainment. We ask for your warm blessings for the couple&rsquo;s future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bomi then took to her official fan cafe to share a handwritten note, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to spend the rest of my life with someone who has been by my side for a long time while sharing our everyday lives and being together through both happy times and difficult moments. I didn&rsquo;t know I would be delivering this news like this, but I really wanted to convey my feelings to PANDA, who are like my long-time friends, first.&rdquo; She apologized for letting her life update be conveyed via an article first, as well as for her personal decision to take this step, even as fans await news about Apink&rsquo;s new music after 3 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rado has previously worked on the girl group&rsquo;s releases like Only one and I&rsquo;m so sick, alongside being the producer for multiple K-pop hits for STAYC, TWICE, Chung Ha, Sistar, and MissA.

Agency and Jang Jae Hyun respond]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-12/1487973102_yoo-ah-in.webp"></img><p>Chicago Typewriter star Yoo Ah In may be eyeing his acting comeback already. According to reports, on December 17, he was cast in the upcoming production by director Jang Jae Hyun, known for his work in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/happy-kim-go-eun-day-goblin-exhuma-little-women-and-more-exploring-talented-actress-versatile-roles-1323027">Exhuma</a>, The Priests, and Svaha: The Sixth Finger. However, both the actor&rsquo;s management and the filmmaker have responded with vague comments. Called Vampire, the film will focus on the supernatural creatures in a new setting.</p>

<p><strong>Yoo Ah In&rsquo;s acting career looms in uncertainty with possible involvement in Jung Jae Hyun&#39;s film</strong></p>

<p>A Sports Chosun report quoted an entertainment insider stating that Yoo Ah In will be making his return to Korean films with Vampire. Previously, the Jang PD had shared that they&#39;re in the early stages of developing an original Korean story with vampires as its central theme, with inspiration from Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula. &quot;I want to create a vampire film set in the Russian Orthodox Church,&quot; he had revealed, and dedicated 2 years to writing the screenplay and 4 years to release it. It seems that Vampire is scheduled to begin filming in the second half of next year.</p>

<p>With rumors rampant, an Ilgan Sports report clarified the status. Yoo Ah In&rsquo;s agency, UAA, was careful about its response, stating &ldquo;nothing has been decided yet&rdquo;. Director Jang Jae Hyun, meanwhile, denied the casting rumors, saying reports of Yoo Ah In&rsquo;s involvement are &ldquo;not true&rdquo;. They doubled down that decisions have not been finalized, adding that while discussions about the project are going on, the casting remains completely undecided.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yoo Ah In has been away from the entertainment industry for 3 years now, owing to his personal scandals, which shook the internet. The 39-year-old was supposed to be a part of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hellbound-season-2-full-review-kim-sung-cheol-and-kim-hyun-joos-strong-performances-resurrect-compelling-plot-yet-struggle-for-clarity-1355430">Hellbound season 2</a> before reports of him being replaced were confirmed. His other projects, including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/yoo-ah-in-to-appear-in-the-match-despite-drug-scandal-director-kim-hyung-ju-confirms-1376478">The Match</a> and Goodbye Earth, were also put on hold and released belatedly. The director for Hi.5 also decided not to edit out his scenes in order not to compromise the quality of the film. Yoo Ah In continues to remain away from the spotlight since his controversies came to light.</p>

Girl and boy groups, as well as solo acts, it was one exciting release after another. Here&rsquo;s a look at some of our favorites releases in no particular order.</p>

<p><strong>1. Jennie Like JENNIE: </strong>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-adds-2-shows-to-deadline-world-tour-across-singapore-and-hong-kong-know-new-schedule-1397004">BLACKPINK</a> member made an inimitable impact on the music scene this year. With solo music show appearances and global performances, everyone could only talk about Jennie, and she ensured that her songs did too. Like JENNIE&rsquo;s repetitive tune became a total earworm, and the choreography invited countless to participate.</p>

<p><strong>2. J-Hope Killin&rsquo; It Girl: </strong>The dance master was back, and he made sure everyone knew it. Baring his abs for the first time around, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-ot7-livestream-rm-gets-drivers-license-group-reveals-year-end-plans-and-wonders-if-suga-secretly-got-married-1399179">BTS</a> member geared up for his solo adventure with this collaboration alongside GloRilla, who featured on a verse.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Thunder:</strong> The thirteen-member team gave the last bow before their military era with another powerful number. Knife-like dance moves aside, Thunder made its way into party playlists without letting anyone realise it and held onto its position.</p>

<p><strong>4. KATSEYE&rsquo;s Gnarly: </strong>Noise music, thought you&rsquo;d never get accustomed to it? The girl group managed to bring on a lot of chatter around their new song, with differing opinions surrounding them. Soon after, everyone was obsessed with the track, and just like that, KATSEYE had another winner on their hands.</p>

<p><strong>5. HUNTRIX&rsquo;s (Ejae, Audrey Nuna, Rei Ami) Golden: </strong>The world was (and still is) painted golden earlier this year. Unexpectedly, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/kpop-demon-hunters-sequel-greenlit-as-animated-film-becomes-netflixs-most-watched-with-236-million-views-1396144">KPop Demon Hunters</a> took over everyone&rsquo;s lives with a fabulous storyline and animation, but its music more so. The track has become an anthem full of encouragement and has made millions of fans of a fictional K-pop group.</p>

<p><strong>6. NMIXX&rsquo;s Blue Valentine: </strong>The JYP Entertainment girl group&rsquo;s success is long overdue. With music spanning across many genres, the team has always kept it interesting, and this time was no different. Blue Valentine began small but is now enjoying a steady run on charts, and for all the right reasons.</p>

<p><strong>7. ALLDAY PROJECT&rsquo;s FAMOUS: </strong>One of the most awaited debuts of the year happened with THEBLACKLABEL&rsquo;s ADP, where a chaebol heiress, a former ILLIT member, a former Trainee A member, a popular choreographer, and an influencer would come together. The co-ed team managed to grab eyeballs right from the start with a song that read, &lsquo;we ain&rsquo;t even famous.&rsquo; What a power move!</p>

<p><strong>8. CORTIS&rsquo; GO:</strong> After BTS and TXT, what was next for BIGHIT MUSIC? The famed K-pop agency showed off its cards with CORTIS, who made everyone GO crazy with easy dance moves and a catchy tune.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9. Dayoung&rsquo;s Body: </strong>The most unpredictable success of the year came along with WJSN&rsquo;s Dayoung, who made a notorious debut on the charts and rose to the heights. The single brought along a fun dance challenge and showed off her strong traits.</p>

<p><strong>10. Hwasa&rsquo;s Good Goodbye: </strong>One music video, a long letter, and a viral award moment, Hwasa and actor Park Jung Min hoodwinked everyone with their romantic performance. Soon, the song caught the general public&rsquo;s attention and resulted in Perfect All Kills on music charts.</p>

<p><strong>Special Mentions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Saja Boys&rsquo; (Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, Samuil Lee) Soda Pop: </strong>It was the year of KPop Demon Hunters and what&rsquo;s talking about the animated film if not about the very hunters. True, blue K-pop, the song received dance covers and cosplay attempts from famed K-pop stars themselves, including ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Jay and WONHO.</p>

<p><strong>KATSEYE&rsquo;s Gabriela: </strong>The only act to have two songs on our list, Gabriela was an unexpected hit with catchy lyrics but even catchier dance moves. The hand swirls ignited attention from anyone and everyone watching their performances.</p>

<p><strong>TXT&rsquo;s Love Language: </strong>TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s comeback was long-awaited by fans, and the quintet delivered a fabulous show once again. With swift choreography and their princely charms bleeding into their music, the track was another fast seller.&nbsp;</p>

During the press conference of her latest K-drama, I Dol I, fellow Girl&rsquo;s Generation member Choi Sooyoung was asked how she felt about the happy news, and the singer-actress expressed her happiness. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sooyoung reacts to Tiffany dating Byun Yo Han</strong></p>

<p>I Dol I is an upcoming K-drama starring Kim Jae Young and Choi Sooyoung in the lead roles. During a press show on December 16, ahead of its premiere next week, the lead actress was asked about fellow <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/girls-generations-yoona-reveals-taking-career-break-after-king-the-land-to-recharge-physically-plans-to-go-full-throttle-this-year-1366028">SNSD</a> member Tiffany Young&rsquo;s dating confirmation and letter about plans to marry soon. And since it could be sensitive for her, not being directly involved in the update, she briefly commented about how she felt about it, as well as her thoughts on hearing the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As reported by Maeil Kyungjae, she shared, &nbsp;&ldquo;I was really happy. It&rsquo;s genuinely such happy news and something you can&rsquo;t help but support. And honestly, the closest friends in my life are the members themselves, so no matter what choice they make, it&rsquo;s something I truly want to celebrate. I think I feel a bit cautious speaking about it for now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Choi Sooyoung has been dating fellow actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/who-are-you-jung-kyung-ho-cant-fathom-girlfriend-sooyoungs-beauty-leaves-shocking-comments-on-new-photos-1346207">Jung Kyung Ho</a> for the past 12 years. Many have been curious about their plans for the future, including marriage; the two have maintained that their demanding careers are their priority at the moment, and they&rsquo;d get to it when the time comes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Tiffany Young and Byun Yo Han wrote handwritten letters addressed to their fans after reports surfaced of them dating. They confirmed it, shared warm words for each other, and relayed that although they have not set a wedding date yet, they&rsquo;d let their well-wishers know about it beforehand.&nbsp;</p>

As RM, Jin, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook joined in for a chat with their fans after a long time, the familiar chaotic feel set in. And while they spoke about everything and nothing in particular, a big announcement dropped from the leader, who revealed that he had finally gotten his driver&rsquo;s license.</p>

<p><strong>BTS member RM receives a driver&rsquo;s license</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-did-rm-say-its-time-to-disband-bts-know-truth-behind-hilarious-livestream-exchange-with-jimin-1398647">RM</a> was the only <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/park-seo-joon-picks-if-he-would-attend-bts-v-or-park-hyung-siks-marriage-should-they-fall-on-same-day-1399146">BTS</a> member who was without a driver&rsquo;s license and would need to be driven around. However, that has changed now as the star revealed how he had managed to succeed in his driving test. J-Hope teased him that there were rumors he failed it once, and the rapper added how he ended up surpassing a line in the center while making a U-turn due to the wiped away paint, but in the end, he received his driver&rsquo;s license. The members congratulated him on successfully doing so and asked him to take the wheel the next time they&rsquo;re out. The BTS leader added that he could drive but needed practice with parking.</p>

<p>The most common comment during the team&rsquo;s livestream continues to be &lsquo;Yoongi marry me,&rsquo; aimed at member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-suga-fulfills-2-year-old-promise-to-fans-teases-possible-new-project-with-return-to-instagram-pics-1397116">SUGA</a>. The members asked the rapper if he had secretly gotten married without their knowledge. Meanwhile, Jimin shared that by this time, he must have someone in his heart. The hilarious situation made everyone laugh out loud.</p>

<p>Their discussions about the upcoming album continued, and as the fans asked the members to keep turning on the livestream often, they decided to do a year-end party where they would wear suits. Just like this, an upcoming live session was planned for BTS ARMY to look forward to. While the grandeur of Jin&rsquo;s house made them want to host it there, the boys decided to stick to the company office.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTS has recently been working on their comeback album, said to be released in March 2026, with all songs reportedly already recorded.</p>

During an appearance on a chat show, he was asked about his friend group, Wooga Squad, which comprises himself alongside fellow actors <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/wooga-squad-besties-park-hyung-sik-and-park-seo-joon-show-love-to-choi-woo-shik-on-his-birthday-be-together-forever-1379313">Choi Woo Shik and Park Hyung Sik</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/choi-woo-shik-hijacks-bts-vs-phone-for-selfie-latter-shares-sweet-date-moment-with-wooga-squad-1397724">BTS member V</a> and musician Peakboy. A tight-knit bunch, the 36-year-old was quizzed on which one of his friends he would choose over the other should they both have their wedding ceremonies on the same day. The actor has an interesting response, showing how he loves all of them equally.</p>

<p><strong>Park Seo Joon reveals the truth behind his friendship with V and Park Hyung Sik</strong><br />
Appearing on the Coupang Play reality show, Dabang Sisters, hosted by Lee Soo Ji and Jung Yi Rang, Park Seo Joon played a Balance Game where a particularly difficult question caught him off guard. The former asked the star with a smile, &ldquo;On the same day, at the same time, V&rsquo;s wedding VS Park Hyungsik&rsquo;s wedding. Whose wedding are you going to?&rdquo; The actor confidently replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going [to either]. I think I&rsquo;ll go on a trip that day. I&rsquo;d rather disappoint both of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Park Seo Joon appeared shocked about if he ever had to pick between his two best friends, he&rsquo;d rather not pick either of them and disappoint them both, rather than having them think he prefers one over the other. This only goes on to show their very close relationship, which has been built for many years now, especially since they met on the sets of Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth, which marked the BTS member&rsquo;s debut acting project.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, this is Tiffany Young.<br />
I hope that you spending this winter with warmth and are safe this weekend.<br />
To those of you who cherish this space, I&rsquo;m giving a cautious greeting.<br />
I&#39;m leaving these words to personally address the news revealed today.<br />
I am currently dating someone with the thought of marriage in mind.&nbsp;<br />
He is someone who makes me view the world with a positive, hopeful outlook and puts me at ease.<br />
Even though nothing is currently confirmed as of now, when important decisions are made, I will let my fans know about it first and foremost.<br />
Thank you sincerely for supporting me watching over me warmly all this time. I will never forget these feelings, cherishing them in my heart as I continue to do my best in my place and repay you.<br />
Thank you. Uploaded by Tiffany.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, this is Byun Yo Han.<br />
BanHan family members, are your days in comfort? It&#39;s a winter that feels like wherever your feet take you, the atmosphere has quieted down.&nbsp;<br />
I hope that this winter will be one where the warmth becomes more apparent even in the cold air for all BanHan. It is also my sincere wish that you will take caution against even the most trivial colds and your body and mind both remain peaceful.&nbsp;<br />
When I think about how much you have loved me, how much you have rejoiced and celebrated me throughout my journey, I cannot help but bow my head and utter words of gratitude. Once again, I thank you with all my heart.<br />
I&rsquo;m writing this letter to you thinking about how whenever I have important news to deliver, the ones who I want should hear it from me first are BanHan. I&#39;m both cautious and a little concerned that you may be shocked by this sudden news.<br />
I am in a relationship with a good person, considering marriage in mind. There are currently no set plans or dates, but I have always felt that I needed to relay this news to my fans first.<br />
I have met someone whom I love, who makes me become a better person when I am with them, watching whose smile makes my tired heart warm.&nbsp;<br />
It is my hope that our smiles will grow into happiness, and that our sorrows will grow into lessons in maturity, and that through such experiences, I will become an actor who can deliver warmth.&nbsp;<br />
BanHan, may your days be filled with laughter, and may happiness follow you every step in your path. As for me, I would like to continue working harder than ever before to create projects that you all can enjoy.<br />
By Byun Yo Han.&quot;</p>

On December 6, a day after news about his past, including high school delinquent actions, was made public, the star decided to step down from the industry. He shared his decision via a statement from his agency, SARAM Entertainment, apologizing for his past incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cho Jin Woong announces retirement after past actions come to light</strong></p>

<p>Sharing an apology and his decision to step back from his career, Sports World reported the following statement via <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/the-asia-contents-awards-global-ott-awards-byeon-woo-seok-nominated-for-newcomer-park-bo-young-kim-hye-yoon-for-lead-actor-more-1344443">Cho Jin Woong</a>&rsquo;s agency. &ldquo;Firstly, I bow my head in apology for disappointing everyone who believed in me and supported me, over the disgraceful incidents from my past. I humbly accept all criticism, and as of today, I will suspend all activities and bring my acting career to an end. I believe this is the rightful responsibility and duty I must bear for my past mistakes.&rdquo; He promised that henceforth, he would try his hardest to stand back on his feet as a respectable human being and apologized sincerely. He concluded with a message to his fans. &ldquo;Thank you to everyone I loved and respected. I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously, a Dispatch report claimed that the actor had spent time in a youth detention center for his wrongdoings as a juvenile. The accusations made included reported vehicle theft and ass*ult, as well as being booked for drunk driving during filming for Once Upon a Time in High School. His agency then released a statement sharing their apology for the actor&rsquo;s actions as a minor. They added that not many of the allegations could be verified due to having happened over 30 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were reported claims that the star changed his name to use his father&rsquo;s as a way to conceal his actions; however, the management clarified that it was an attempt to bring change in his life as a new person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was recently confirmed that one of the most-awaited K-dramas, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/the-ultimate-list-of-must-watch-thrilling-serial-killer-k-dramas-1203836">Signal</a>, will&nbsp;be renewed for a sequel with the original cast, including Cho Jin Woon, Kim Hye Soo, and Lee Je Hoon, reprising their roles.

With the BTS member being linked to actress Lee Yu Bi in 2021, a swift denial from HYBE settled the waters. Earlier this year, aespa&rsquo;s agency shut down claims of her being romantically involved with ENHYPEN&rsquo;s Jungwon and shared that they&rsquo;d be taking legal action against the rumormonger instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this year, HYBE revealed that BTS member Jimin had been previously meeting TV personality and actress Song Da Eun with &lsquo;good feelings&rsquo; before, but the two have not spoken in many years, as new videos from their time together resurfaced on the internet. They have not confirmed any relationships involving other BTS members.</p>

In the end, Kim Go Eun and Jeon Do Yeon were picked for the main characters, with the former picking an out-and-out dark role for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When and where is The Price of Confession releasing?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jeon-do-yeon-kim-go-euns-the-price-of-confession-locks-december-5-premiere-unveils-chilling-teaser-1398245">The Price of Confession</a>, starring Kim Go Eun and Jeon Do Yeon,&nbsp;is all set to drop on December 5, 2025.

Spread across 12 episodes, the show is expected to release all at once, ready to be binge-watched over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is The Price of Confession about?</strong><br />
Jeon Do Yeon plays Ahn Yoon Soo, a normal-looking art teacher. Suddenly, her life turns upside down as her husband is killed under suspicious circumstances. With no clues on hand, she becomes the prime suspect and is unable to defend herself. Then, she comes across a woman nicknamed the &lsquo;witch&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Kim Go Eun&rsquo;s Mo Eun approaches Ahn Yoon Soo.&nbsp;Mo Eun is disliked by other inmates over her ability to see through people very easily and read them, much to their disappointment. Soon, she suggests something absurd, trying to convince the teacher to take the deal. Ready to take on the blame for the husband&rsquo;s murder, she plans a bold move. Ahn Yoon Soo must actually take the life of someone in order to be able to clear herself of the charges of killing her husband.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the outside world, two more people get deeply involved in the case. A prosecutor who earns his reputation for being wise and understanding, Baek Dong Hun (Park Hae Soo) gains interest in the case involving Mo Eun and Ahn Yoon Soo&rsquo;s newly formed bond. It goes against his principles, but his curiosity gets the better of him, and he begins digging deep.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ahn Yoon Soo&rsquo;s lawyer, Jang Jeong Gu (Jin Seon Kyu), is a former boxer with strict morals. He is determined to prove his client&rsquo;s innocence, unaware of her deal.</p>

<p>Directed by Lee Jeong Hyo, thriller, mystery, crime drama, The Price of Confession, is all set to release on December 5, 2025, on Netflix.</p>

<p><strong>Kim Hee Seon: </strong>Na Jeong always puts her family first, but if I lived her life for a day, I&rsquo;d want to give her a little time just for herself. I think that time would help her regain strength and return to her family with even warmer energy.<br />
<strong>Han Hye Jin: </strong>I&rsquo;d want to shift Ju Young&rsquo;s focus from what she doesn&rsquo;t have to appreciating and finding joy in what she does have.<br />
<strong>Jin Seo Yeon: </strong>If I lived Lee Il Ri&rsquo;s life for a day, I would give her a moment to rest. I&rsquo;d want her to pause what she&rsquo;s doing, even briefly, and take time to take care of herself.</p>

<p><strong>How does living in your 40s look for you? How is it similar or different from your character&#39;s life?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kim Hee Seon: </strong>I see my forties as a time when I&rsquo;m learning to find a bit more ease, both as an actor and as a mother. There are similarities with my character, but also differences. I try to consistently maintain balance so I don&rsquo;t lose myself, and I think that may be where Na Jeong and I differ.<br />
<strong>Han Hye Jin: </strong>In my forties, I try to do my best without being overly attached to the outcome. Like Ju Young, I also find it hard to openly share my worries or struggles with others. But unlike her, I don&rsquo;t cling to things too much.<br />
<strong>Jin Seo Yeon: </strong>I&rsquo;m also living my forties, but I think I&rsquo;ve managed to find a good balance in my life. What I share with my character is &ldquo;passion for my work,&rdquo; and what&rsquo;s different is that I learned earlier on how to protect myself. So while playing Lee Il Ri, it sometimes felt like having a conversation with my younger self.</p>

<p><strong>If you had one advice you&#39;d like to give other women in their 40s or going through the same troubles as your characters, what would it be?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kim Hee Seon: </strong>I&rsquo;m not perfect either, and I live with my own worries every day. So rather than advice, I want to say this: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to pause. Just don&rsquo;t lose yourself completely.&rdquo; Jo Na Jeong&rsquo;s journey also began from that small bit of courage.<br />
<strong>Han Hye Jin: </strong>I hope we can all free ourselves from other people&rsquo;s expectations and the image we feel we must maintain.<br />
<strong>Jin Seo Yeon: </strong>To women in their forties, and to anyone living a reality similar to Lee Il Ri&rsquo;s, I want to say this: &ldquo;Every day you&rsquo;ve made it through is already something incredible.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t focus only on becoming stronger &ndash; sometimes you need the courage to let yourself rest.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-12/1282526256_twice-stray-kids-1.webp"></img><p>JYP Entertainment, one of the biggest K-pop entertainment agencies in the world, may soon be heading to India! According to a report from The Korea Herald, the South Korean media giant is eyeing the 1.4 billion market in India next. Previously, HYBE, home to Grammy-nominated act BTS, SEVENTEEN, ENHYPEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, and more famed K-pop acts, launched its fifth overseas branch in Mumbai. If the JY Park-founded company also confirms its standing in the country, it would become the second major label to do so.</p>

<p><strong>What are the plans by JYP Entertainment to enter India?</strong></p>

<p>According to the report, an industry source shared, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/stray-kids-twices-agency-jyp-entertainment-ranked-third-on-worlds-best-companies-in-sustainable-growth-2025-list-1361181">JYP Entertainment</a> is preparing to open its office in India to target the local music market. The exact location or timeline has not been decided, but the timing seems right as K-pop&rsquo;s popularity continues to rise among younger generations in India.&rdquo; However, the agency itself has not confirmed so, instead saying that they&rsquo;re unaware of any such plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India would be fourth in the management label&rsquo;s international functions following its operations in the United States, Japan, and China. The popularity of JYP Entertainment groups, including TWICE and Stray Kids, is as high as ever, with the latter even seeking <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/stray-kids-bang-chan-reveals-turning-to-bollywood-music-for-ceremony-comeback-took-inspiration-from-indian-music-1396052">inspiration from Indian music</a> for one of its recent releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, G-Dragon&rsquo;s company, Galaxy Corporation, was rumored to be eyeing a branch in India after looking at the rapid growth of the country and HYBE&rsquo;s entry into the music scene. The latter has already set up office and is looking for professionals to join their team, with job opportunities set up. The BIGBANG member&rsquo;s label is yet to share any concrete details, with apparently only market research being conducted as of now. They currently run teams in Japan, the US, and Hong Kong, with a Singapore office that does not run independently, making India their fourth possible launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from TWICE and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/2025-k-world-dream-awards-full-winners-list-stray-kids-ive-txt-and-kpop-demon-hunters-take-big-accolades-1395932">Stray Kids</a>, JYP Entertainment is the home to 2PM, Day6, ITZY, NMIXX, KickFlip, and more, providing a wide range of artist experiences.&nbsp;</p>

However, on December 1, 202,5 it was announced that SUNG HAN BIN, KIM JI WOONG, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/zerobaseones-zhang-hao-does-damage-control-after-failing-to-recognize-apt-is-blackpinks-roses-song-watch-1354882">ZHANG HAO</a>, SEOK MATTHEW, KIM TAE RAE, RICKY, KIM GYU VIN, PARK GUN WOOK, and HAN YU JIN have decided to extend their activities for another 2 months. The team revealed plans for an encore concert, which will continue their official promotions through to March.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s what ZB1 shared on their social media, confirming their extension of contract&nbsp;</strong><br />
&ldquo;Notice Regarding ZEROBASEONE&#39;s Upcoming Plans<br />
Hello, this is WAKEONE.<br />
First of all, we would like to sincerely thank all ZEROSE for your unwavering love and support for ZEROBASEONE. We would like to provide an update regarding ZEROBASEONE&#39;s upcoming plans.<br />
After sincere in-depth discussions with all 9 members of ZEROBASEONE<br />
(SUNG HAN BIN, KIM JI WOONG, ZHANG HAO, SEOK MATTHEW, KIM TAE RAE, RICKY, KIM GYU VIN, PARK GUN WOOK, HAN YU JIN), the company and the members have mutually agreed to extend ZEROBASEONE&#39;s group activities for an additional 2 months.<br />
This decision was reached unanimously by all ZEROBASEONE members, who hold deep affection for the team and wish to repay the great love they have received from the fans.<br />
Accordingly, ZEROBASEONE will continue promoting as a full team, and they will also meet the fans at the upcoming &lt;2025 ZEROBASEONE WORLD TOUR &#39;HERE&amp;NOW&#39;&gt; encore concert and share precious moments together.<br />

WAKEONE will also do its utmost to ensure that every moment shared between ZEROBASEONE and ZEROSE shines even brighter.<br />

<p>This new move has, however, instilled another worry in the fans of the group who think that disbandment may soon dawn upon them. Having won 10 rookie awards, the boys of ZEROBASEONE possess a large global fanbase that has long been waiting for an update regarding the continuation of their activities under the same roof. The team last released their first studio album, Never Say Neve,r in September this year, followed by a Japanese EP. They are ready to resume their world tour soon, which will continue in the coming months, extending to March 2026.</p>

<p>The BTS members are some of the most well-earning K-pop acts of this generation. With millions of fans worldwide who buy millions of albums and stream their songs billions of times, alongside brand endorsements and real estate properties, as well as personal investments, they&rsquo;re high up on the rich Korean entertainers&rsquo; list. This has allowed them to have expensive tastes and buy some of the most luxurious items, with V being a frontrunner.</p>

<p>Leith Ford has reported that the 2025 Ford Mustang GTD costs up to around 325,000 USD, with some other estimates high-balling it to 350K USD. Previously, V was seen arriving at the airport in a Bentley Flying Spur Car instead of a company SUV last month. In December 2021, the star shared a video driving a red Ford Mustang Convertible while on vacation; however, that seemed to be a rented spin for his vacation. It appears that his 4-year-old test run resulted in a real-life buy for the star.&nbsp;</p>

Later, when he joined them back for a few weeks together, it seems that the singer had a blast and was once again reminded of their musical skills.</p>

<p><strong>Jin gets blown away by fellow BTS members&rsquo; musical ability</strong></p>

<p>Speaking to the Spur magazine, the singer revealed his shock over the results of the new music that they had managed to create in such a short time. &ldquo;While the members were working on producing the new songs in America, I joined them a little later because of my solo tour. Listening to the songs they had created during the time I was away, I was deeply moved by their level of completion and artistic quality. When I reunited with the members and heard their music, I once again strongly felt, &lsquo;These people are truly remarkable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/sugas-mind-program-concert-sells-out-tickets-organizers-reveals-if-bts-member-will-attend-1398622">BTS</a> reunion has long been the center of attention for many who have been waiting for them to come back and take over the K-pop music scene. Slowly and surely, the seven members of the team have been seen preparing for the new album set to be released around March 2026. They recently wrapped up the recording for their album and were known to have begun revising some necessary parts.&nbsp;</p>

The rapper funded the creation of a treatment center in his name, and now that it&rsquo;s functional, there are new and exciting opportunities that the star is spreading. Recently, a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-sugas-mind-program-arranges-first-ever-concert-with-his-tour-band-for-autistic-kids-fans-praise-singer-1398540">concert called Shining MINDS</a> was announced as a part of the promotion of the Min Yoongi Treatment Center, which will focus on providing a platform for kids on the autistic spectrum. It was also revealed that SUGA Crew, the instrumental members who provided live band during the star&rsquo;s Agust D, D-Day tour, will be performing at the concert.</p>

<p><strong>SUGA skips the MIND program concert</strong></p>

<p>The director of the Min Yoongi treatment center shared that as soon as the ticketing was opened for the MIND Program&rsquo;s upcoming concert, it sold out immediately, showing the wildly impactful influence of the Korean star. Excitement is at an all-time high considering the functioning of the show and whether their main sponsor, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/winners-seungyoon-says-thankful-for-bts-jin-recalling-close-bond-during-military-he-contacted-me-first-1398558">BTS</a> member SUGA, will be attending the concert to observe it.</p>

<p>A statement was shared by the organizers denying the possibility of his arrival, clarifying that, in order to avoid overcrowding, they have decided to reveal it. &ldquo;To prevent congestion on the day of the event, on-site ticket purchases will not be available. For order and safety on the day of the concert, we inform you in advance that the center&rsquo;s sponsor, SUGA, will not be attending the event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This has made it clear that SUGA will be cheering for the event from afar while he works on new BTS music. Previously, he accompanied fellow group members to Los Angeles for two months, where they worked with skilled producers and composers for their 2026 album. The post-military comeback will mark the first new BTS music in over 3.5 years and is all set to drop in spring, around the time of March, as previously teased by leader RM.</p>

The news comes 10 years after they first started dating, and both stars are now well into their successful careers. However, fans are only now learning that it was a noona-romance trope all along, with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-woo-bin-pens-sweet-note-to-fans-after-announcing-marriage-to-shin-min-ah-starting-family-with-my-partner-1398583">Kim Woo Bin</a> being 5 years younger than his to-be wife, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/were-kim-woo-bin-and-shin-min-ah-caught-on-date-in-australia-agency-clarifies-about-photo-from-overseas-trip-1372136">Shin Min Ah</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>All about Kim Woo Bin and Shin Min Ah&rsquo;s 5-year age gap</strong></p>

<p>A popular K-drama trope, the older woman and younger man set-up is fans&rsquo; favorite, and the same is the case with the power couple, which shares a 5-year age gap between them. Kim Hyun Joong (Kim Woo Bin&rsquo;s real name) was born on July 16, 1989. Meanwhile, Yang Min Ah (Shin Min Ah&rsquo;s real name) was born on April 5, 1984. At present, they are 36 and 41 years old, respectively, making this a perfect noona (older woman to a man) romance moment in the K-dramaland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After meeting for a Giordano shoot, which brought them together on screen for the first time, they reportedly continued being in touch. Subsequently, they were spotted around and rumored to be dating, which their agencies at the time confirmed soon after. Now, a decade later, the two are ready to start a new chapter in their lives by promising to walk the path of life by each other&rsquo;s side, and the world is ready to witness their love story take its most-awaited turn.</p>

<p>Shin Min Ah supported Kim Woo Bin through his nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosis and treatment in 2017, which saw him take a step back from the world of show business and focus on his health. They also starred in the project, Our Blues, together, but refrained from acting as each other&rsquo;s love interests in order to provide the best possible outcome in the K-drama.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jin has embarked on his first journey to connect with ARMY, whether in person or online. Spanning 10 cities and 20 performances - from Goyang to Japan, North America, Europe, and back to Incheon - the most thrilling moments of the tour are now ready to unfold on the big screen.<br />

Agency reacts amid marriage announcement]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-11/562515008_shin-min-ah-kim-woo-bin.webp"></img><p>Kim Woo Bin and Shin Min Ah are finally <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/shin-min-ah-and-kim-woo-bin-to-get-married-in-december-after-10-years-of-dating-1398579">getting married after a decade</a> of being together. The couple confirmed their plans to tie the knot on November 20, exactly a month before they begin their new life together. While the couple has been going strong ever since they admitted to being in a relationship back in 2015, their sudden marriage announcement has led to questions about a possible pre-marital pregnancy, leading to their decision to hold a wedding in December. However, their agency has firmly denied any such speculations and asked for support instead.</p>

<p><strong>Shin Min Ah&rsquo;s side shuts down pregnancy rumors post marriage announcement to Kim Woo Bin</strong></p>

<p>AM Entertainment, the agency of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/karmas-shin-min-ah-wants-compelling-darker-roles-and-considers-playing-villain-no-one-ever-offers-1381572">Shin Min Ah</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-woo-bin-pens-sweet-note-to-fans-after-announcing-marriage-to-shin-min-ah-starting-family-with-my-partner-1398583">Kim Woo Bin</a>, firmly refuted speculations that their decision to marry was based on any pre-marital pregnancy, as unfounded rumors began to spread. Online haters even compared the actress&rsquo;s recent appearance at The Remarried Empress event in Hong Kong for Disney+ to her previous figure. However, as per their statement to Xports News, &ldquo;There is absolutely no premarital pregnancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While not revealing any further information, the management company added, &ldquo;The wedding will take place at the Shilla Hotel. The officiant, emcee, and musical performances have not yet been decided.&rdquo; The couple&rsquo;s many friends from the entertainment industry are expected to attend their wedding.</p>

<p>Shin Min Ah and Kim Woo Bin&rsquo;s love story is surely one for the books. The two first met during a brand shoot back in 2015 and quickly fell for each other, confirming that they were dating via their agencies. After 10 years of being together, during which the actress stood in solidarity with her boyfriend as he battled nasopharyngeal cancer in 2017, and went on cute dates sharing photos taken by each other on social media, they have finally decided to get married and start a family of their own.</p>

<p>They have asked their fans to send support for their new chapter and hope to continue being their favorites even in the future.</p>

<p>Their management label shared the happy news, as reported by Sports Donga, &quot;Actress Shin Min Ah and actor Kim Woo Bin have promised to be each other&#39;s companions based on the deep trust they have built through their long relationship.&quot; Not going into the details, they have shared that the two will wed via a private ceremony. &quot;Their wedding will be held privately on December 20th at a location in Seoul with only their families, relatives, and close acquaintances in attendance.&quot;</p>

Their unexpected bond was met with surprise from fans who had not known if they were actually familiar with each other before this.

<p><strong>WINNER&rsquo;s Seungyoon reveals how he and Jin became friends</strong></p>

<p>During an appearance on KBS Cool FM&#39;s Park Myung Soo&#39;s Radio Show on November 19, Kang Seungyoon recalled his military days. He was asked about the photos involving the BTS member, as well as how their photos came to be. &quot;I met him as a drill instructor at the training camp I was a part of.&quot; On being asked about being together in the same base, the junior responded, &quot;I was just so envious. He&#39;s such a world star, he already seemed so big, but he seemed like a God within the military.&rdquo; However, to him, the older star was anything but aloof, setting an example with his generous ways, &rdquo;But this God-like Jin took care of me and even gave me Choco Pies, and I can&#39;t tell you how grateful I was.&quot;</p>

<p>The 31-year-old shared how it was Jin who encouraged him to apply for the same position as himself. Though they didn&rsquo;t originally know each other, the BTS member heard about it and contacted the junior first. The Abyss hitmaker told him, &ldquo;Have you ever thought about becoming a drill instructor with me? If you work hard at the training center, you can do this and that. Apply to be an instructor &mdash; let&rsquo;s serve in the same unit as instructors!&rdquo; But despite his hard work, Seungyoon ended up in the infantry division.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, Jin shared images with Kang Seungyoon, and it has now been revealed that those photos were from their last march.

While the debate goes on about the use of artificial intelligence in the entertainment industry, the younger generation is already coming up with ideas to put it to good use. The singer and actor&rsquo;s donsaeng has worked to create a program that would help celebrities (including his own elder brother) tackle malicious comments on the internet. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cha Eun Woo&rsquo;s brother forays into the world of AI</strong></p>

<p>Previously, it was believed that Lee Dong Hwi would also follow his older brother&rsquo;s footsteps and enter the entertainment industry. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/why-is-cha-eun-woos-agency-blocking-fan-mail-and-gifts-to-stars-military-base-find-out-1394838">Cha Eun Woo</a> revealed how the younger one was a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/cha-eun-woos-younger-brother-grabs-attention-with-handsome-visuals-as-actor-takes-military-break-pic-1395554">Producer/Director (PD) at a show</a> he shot; however, he has now ventured into a completely different zone, taking on the challenge of AI programming.

<p>Lee Dong Hwi appeared in the clip, talking about how having been subjected to the world of trolling. &ldquo;How can they communicate better with fans?&rdquo; he wondered and joined Unbound Lab&rsquo;s team, incorporating his media studies in China into his interests and protection for his family member, singer-actor Cha Eun Woo. &ldquo;I have seen many celebrities suffer from online hate. Of course, we need to accept constructive feedback and grow, but with so much media out there, there are a lot of malicious comments that go too far,&rdquo; he explained about his decision to work in the field of tracking data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The young star doubled down on his resolve to create a system to protect those exposed to the media.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-11/477801031_g-dragon.webp"></img><p>India is becoming the hottest country in the eyes of K-pop entertainment companies, and the news couldn&rsquo;t come soon enough for the fans. It seems that Galaxy Corp., which houses <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/g-dragon-speaks-about-wanting-to-get-married-opens-up-on-meeting-bigbang-bandmate-taeyangs-kid-1398270">G-Dragon</a> and is behind productions like the famed Netflix reality TV show, Physical: 100, is eyeing India for its new branch.</p>

<p><strong>G-Dragon&rsquo;s company eyes its Indian arm</strong></p>

<p>Galaxy Corporation currently has its offices in Japan, the US, and Hong Kong, as well as a virtual branch in Singapore. With India adding to the bunch, a solid task force presents itself at the core of K-pop, backed by the agency&rsquo;s experience. A source shared with The Korea Herald, &ldquo;Galaxy Corp.&rsquo;s business division is conducting market research related to entry into India and is also working on establishing an Indian subsidiary. At the end of last year, G-Dragon&rsquo;s team also inquired locally about concert demand and performance guarantees for the artist&rsquo;s solo show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If it comes true, the Seoul-based entertainment tech firm would become the second one to enter the Indian market after HYBE launched its office in Mumbai earlier this year. The close to one and a half billion population in the South Asian country is expected to welcome it with a warm reception, with the first of its displays being eyed via a Jungkook exhibition. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkooks-golden-the-moments-exhibition-comes-to-india-this-december-know-how-and-where-to-attend-1398219">GOLDEN : The Moments</a> is all set to run at the Mehboob Studios in Mumbai.</p>

<p>BIGBANG is also said to be preparing for a 2026 comeback, with all three members- G-Dragon, Taeyang, and Daesung, expected to join. The group was announced as one of the headliners at the upcoming Coachella in 2026.&nbsp;Also, the Melon Music Awards 2025 announced that BIGBANG&#39;s G-Dragon will be joining the lineup, all set to happen at Seoul&rsquo;s Gocheok Sky Dome on December 20.</p>

With the grand prize of 300 million won (approximately 223,000 USD) on the line and more than that, their name is waiting for a global spotlight, Culinary Class Wars 2 promises another cutthroat and eventful show.</p>

<p>Notably, season 1 judges <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/has-china-copied-baek-jong-won-anh-sung-jaes-culinary-class-wars-netflix-responds-to-plagiarism-allegations-1394397">Baek Jong Won and Anh Sung Jae</a> were hardly glimpsed at in the first teaser.

The news of their dating was met with a lot of support from fans on both sides; however, their busy schedules acted as a catalyst for their break-up, leaving many reeling from sadness. The songstress has now spoken up about her definition of perfect love and whether she&rsquo;s working hard to love herself.</p>

<p><strong>Jisoo reveals how she feels about love</strong><br />
As revealed by Elle Korea, the Snowdrop star,&nbsp;when asked about love and its most perfect form, said, &ldquo;Most human emotions are connected to love, so I think it&rsquo;s only natural that I end up talking about all different kinds of love. There&rsquo;s no such thing as perfect love. Maybe the final stage of love is living with each other while trying to understand one another as much as possible, getting as close to perfection as we can.&rdquo; Her words come as advice and a reminder to fans of her many songs that are framed around the concept of romance and how affection always finds its way into her life and art.</p>

<p>A lot of her music centers around love, including her solo album AMORTAGE and her most recent collaboration, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jisoo-marks-billboard-hot-100-debut-with-eyes-closed-featuring-zayn-malik-marks-big-milestone-for-blackpink-1397871">EYES CLOSED</a> with Zayn Malik, formerly of One Direction.</p>

<p>Amid her journey to seek love, Jisoo is falling back to the basics and remembering how, amid everything, she will have her ownself. She said, &quot;I&#39;ve always lived my life loving myself and taking good care of myself. I just hope I can continue to do so. When times get tough, I always have myself, so I hope I can overcome them without wavering even at the slightest gust of wind.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently, the 30-year-old is touring the globe alongside her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-extend-deadline-tour-with-concerts-in-chinas-beijing-national-stadium-fans-predict-tickets-to-sell-like-hot-cakes-1394275">BLACKPINK</a> mates. The DEADLINE World Tour will continue till the end of January 2026 and is expected to extend further, following the release of the group&rsquo;s new album.</p>

However, fans of Jimin were quick to share that any common items, including the dolls and ornaments, could be a mere coincidence or even something from the past. They added that the videos seemed old, especially considering the similar house entrance, emphasizing BIGHIT MUSIC&rsquo;s words that they had not spoken in many years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many even allege that the two had probably been living in the same apartment building back then, considering Song Da Eun&rsquo;s recent claims of facing financial difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

She was with her mother at the time of the incident, as he reportedly threatened the two with a weapon and demanded that they give him money. However, the martial arts-trained star was able to subdue the robber with the help of her mom and immediately called the police.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weekend arrived with a scare for the Korean actor, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/nana-doubles-down-on-criticism-of-the-boyzs-sunwoo-amid-fan-backlash-where-did-you-learn-to-act-like-that-1382202">Nana</a>, as she stayed at her Gyeonggi Province residence in South Korea. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-min-hos-omniscient-reader-the-prophet-original-web-novel-storyline-to-star-cast-and-budget-5-things-to-know-before-watching-1394276">The Omniscient Reader: The Prophecy</a> star reportedly had to enter into a physical fight with a perpetrator who broke into her home and suffered minor injuries due to her fight with him.

<p><strong>Nana&#39;s agency reacts to an attempted robbery at her home</strong></p>

<p>In an update shared with Maeil Kyungjae, Nana&rsquo;s agency, SUBLIME, confirmed the attempted armed robbery and shared how the two were doing. &quot;Early this morning, a robber armed with a weapon broke into Nana&#39;s residence. The robber entered the home with the weapon, creating a very dangerous situation where both Nana and her mother could have suffered serious harm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Due to the robber&#39;s physical assault, Nana&#39;s mother suffered serious injuries that left her unconscious, and Nana also suffered physical injuries while trying to escape the crisis. Both of them currently require treatment and absolute rest.&quot; They shared that the specific details of the incident are currently under investigation and cannot be disclosed. However, it was confirmed that around 6:00 am that day, a man broke into a luxury villa in Acheon-dong, Guri-si, and was taken down by two women, suffering injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 34-year-old actress is a former member of the K-pop girl group After School and its subgroups, Orange Caramel and After School Red. She has also been seen in popular acting projects such as Love Weaves Through a Millennium, The Good Wife, Kill It, and, more recently, Mask Girl.</p>

With <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/song-hye-kyo-and-jang-ki-yongs-swoon-worthy-romance-now-we-are-breaking-up-announces-ott-release-date-1370527">Jang Ki Yong</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/namgoong-min-ahn-eun-jins-my-dearest-gets-netflix-release-5-reasons-to-watch-historical-romance-drama-1354359">Ahn Eun Jin</a> in the lead roles, the expectations have always been high for the show. Following its premiere on November 12, the show is all set to air every Wednesday and Thursday at 9 pm KST domestically and internationally on Netflix.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamite Kiss review</strong></p>

<p>The show starts off on a slow pace, as the lives of the two leads are explored. However, it thankfully does not take too long to make them meet and have the very moment that frames the name of their show. A kiss takes place at the end of the first episode and beautifully brings in a shot that will become one of the favorites in its course. The Cindrella-like moment from Ahn Eun Jin is truly a K-drama classic and one that will never get old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that needs definite improvement, it&rsquo;s the dialogue. Absolutely cringey and questionable words are spilled on multiple occasions, making us worry just how the actors managed to even utter those very words. We&rsquo;re hoping things get better from here on out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the two, Ahn Eun Jin fits in the role of Go Da Rim amazingly well. She plays the oldest daughter of the house character with despair and sorrow, filled in her eyes, but manages to flip into a charming woman like a switch. Meanwhile, Kong Ji Hyeok is mostly superficial, unable to blend into the successful tech bro as aptly and quickly.</p>

<p><strong>What is the plot of Dynamite Kiss?</strong></p>

<p>The show follows two people named Kong Ji Hyeok (Jang Ki Yong) and Go Da Rim (Ahn Eun Jin) who meet unexpectedly and share a kiss of a lifetime. Soon after, she joins his company after lying about being married and having a kid on her resume, in order to be able to support her family. While lying about her personal life, she gets hired and joins the company that deals with baby products as an employee in the special team. One day, she suddenly kisses her boss, who believes that she&rsquo;s indeed married and ends up confused as she begins developing feelings for him.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamite Kiss cast&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The actor lineup includes Jang Ki Yong, Ahn Eun Jin, Kim Mu Jun, and Woo Da Vi. Kim Mu Jun&rsquo;s Kim Sun Woo is Go Da Rim&rsquo;s neighbor and dear friend who has a son from a previous marriage. As a close friend, he agrees to portray himself as her fake husband. Meanwhile, Woo Da Vi plays Yoo Ha Young, the youngest daughter of a chaebol family (conglomerate). She gets arranged for a marriage with Kong Ji Hyeok, but ends up developing feelings for Kim Sun Woo.</p>

It was previously reported that she will be joining the ENA survival show Super Seller: Incentive Game to covet the winning prize of 300 million KRW.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Super Seller: Incentive Game puts 40 sellers from a myriad of fields and various levels of experience to compete in a survival show that determines the winner with the help of sales directly, not needing any judges or further criteria in the competition.

<p>Apart from Kim Ji Yoon, the older sibling of the globally popular K-pop star, industry veterans, including Home Shopping Queen Sra Sim from Company C, mobile commerce icon Seo Kyung Hwan, TV show host Lee Chang Woo, YouTuber Malwang, engineering graduate and creator Kim Ddolddol, fashion YouTuber KangtheStylist, magician Choi Hyun Woo, and Jang Won Young lookalike influencer Jihani, have joined the show.</p>

It is said that Kim Ji Yoon is a former flight attendant and is believed to be 35 years old. Apart from that, it is known that she&rsquo;s married and has two sons.

Please proceed with caution.</strong></p>

<p>Kris Wu, the former member of K-pop boy group <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exos-lay-hints-at-possible-involvement-in-full-group-comeback-in-2025-after-4-year-hiatus-fans-react-1365547">EXO</a>, has been at the receiving end of multiple rumors ever since he was imprisoned for 13 years over multiple charges. The latest one is that he has passed away after involving himself with a gang while behind bars as well as rumors of a hunger strike causing his demise. Now, the Chinese police have stepped in to refute all claims surfacing online, confirming that he&rsquo;s alive and denouncing spread of rumors with the threat of legal action.</p>

<p><strong>News of Kris Wu&rsquo;s passing was clarified by the police department in China</strong></p>

<p>Previously, a netizen, who claimed to have been imprisoned in the same prison as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-group-members-1365104">Kris Wu</a>, made a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. &quot;A few days ago, a prison guard secretly said something to me, and then Kris suddenly died,&quot; A wrote. &quot;He was molested by a local gang, and he was killed because he failed to meet the leader&#39;s demands.&quot; Another rumor claimed that his health deteriorated during a hunger strike, leading to his passing.</p>

<p>The posts accompanied an image, the sources of which were unknown, but appeared to be showing the alleged inmate with a prison guard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, according to South Korean media outlets MHN and Sports Chosun&rsquo;s reports, the singer is very much alive. They quoted the Jiangsu Provincial Police Department, sharing that he was living in prison at the moment and had not passed away, as rumors claimed. The concerned photo shared and spread online by netizens is said to have been &ldquo;created by using a past news report screen and replacing the original inmate&rsquo;s face with Kris&rsquo;s face.&rdquo; They also warned rumormongers with a stern statement, &ldquo;Do not disseminate unverified information. You may face legal penalties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kris Wu&rsquo;s prison sentence was confirmed in 2023, and he is known to be currently serving it.</p>

Meanwhile, he is the neglected Grand Prince who has no influence and covets it despite his royal status.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two form a contractual marriage where they initially start off on different ends of the spectrum but slowly become close. Their fake relationship turns into romance, setting off an angst-filled story.</p>

Saying that the agency panics if he gives out any spoilers, he refrained from speaking too much about the album or their new music. However, he assured that he is happy with the turnout. &ldquo;I like this direction of the album, and while I was worried while recording it previously, I think it&rsquo;s working out well now.&rdquo; It was worth their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-in-la-alleged-fan-shares-gym-moment-with-rm-and-v-fans-express-concern-over-location-leak-1393844">time in Los Angeles</a>, shared the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-jungkooks-golden-the-moments-exhibition-comes-to-india-this-december-know-how-and-where-to-attend-1398219">BTS</a> leader.

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for 2026, and we need time, but we&rsquo;ll be back in our [original] state.&rdquo; He also added how they&rsquo;ll surely come to the fans [via a tour], and they&rsquo;re really excited about it. &ldquo;Since everything is coming back to its original place, and we&rsquo;re back as well, it&rsquo;ll be okay.&rdquo; He expressed his wish to visit every continent in the world, towards the latter part of the livestream.</p>

<p><strong>RM quits relying on medication for sleep</strong><br />
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take medicines [for my insomnia] anymore. I stopped taking them around July, and while I still possess them just in case I need them, I have been sleeping on my own, even if it&rsquo;s late. I don&rsquo;t really need them anymore because if I consume them, then as a person, there are lots of ups and downs, and one may become like a zombie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He added that, regardless of everything that has happened with them over the years, they need to stay focused and keep it between them and the fans. &ldquo;There are too many things going around, so I want you to not pay attention and [focus] on the things we do with this album and the things we&rsquo;ll do with you guys.&rdquo; He confirmed that 2026 will be the year of BTS and ARMY.&nbsp;</p>

On November 12, the youngest members, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-haerin-and-hyein-return-to-ador-will-comply-with-exclusive-contract-1398385">Haerin and Hyein</a>, announced their decision to return to their label after the recent ruling verifying the validity of their exclusive contracts. Soon after, members <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/after-haerin-and-hyein-newjeans-minji-hanni-and-danielle-also-confirm-return-to-ador-will-show-our-sincere-music-1398390">Minji, Danielle, and Hanni</a> also confirmed via their legal team that they&rsquo;ll be returning to the management after careful discussions amongst themselves. Former CEO Min Hee Jin has now responded to their decision and decided to support them.</p>

<p><strong>Min Hee Jin sends her support to NewJeans amid their ADOR comeback</strong><br />
The ex-CEO of ADOR, Min Hee Jin, who is currently in a battle of her own against HYBE, reacted to all five members. Here&rsquo;s her official stance as reported by Sports Kyunghyang. &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s decision to return [to ADOR] was undoubtedly a difficult choice made by the members after much thought and consideration. I respect and will support that decision. Although there were difficulties, I cherish the courage of the members who have decided to hold hands together again to protect each other. I can start afresh anywhere. However, I think NewJeans should remain together as a group of five members, no matter the situation. I hope that the members will become stronger, that NewJeans will grow into an even better group, and most of all, that all five members are happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added that she will continue to support <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-and-ador-fail-to-reach-settlement-in-contract-dispute-new-mediation-date-allotted-1395611">NewJeans</a>&#39; music and growth until the end amid her own pending issues with the label.</p>

<p>As of now, the future plans of NewJeans are yet to be finalized or revealed to the public. While Haerin and Hyein are said to have confirmed their return with ADOR directly, Minji, Danielle, and Hanni have yet to have individual discussions with the team. They previously shared that one of the members was in Antarctica, leading to the delay of their announcement.</p>

All members, including Minji, Hanni, and Danielle, have confirmed their return to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-and-ador-fail-to-reach-settlement-in-contract-dispute-new-mediation-date-allotted-1395611">ADOR</a> as of November 12, 2025, deciding to respect the recent ruling related to their exclusive contracts. This news comes about an hour after it was announced that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-haerin-and-hyein-return-to-ador-will-comply-with-exclusive-contract-1398385https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/newjeans-haerin-and-hyein-return-to-ador-will-comply-with-exclusive-contract-1398385">Haerin and Hyein</a> will be returning to their label after careful consideration and discussions with their family, as well as the company. Meanwhile, the label has responded that they&rsquo;re still checking about the three&rsquo;s possible return.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>All five NewJeans lock return to ADOR</strong><br />
According to a Yonhap News report, the three also confirmed their return to ADOR shortly after the news regarding Haerin and Hyein. Here&rsquo;s what they said, &ldquo;Hello, this is Minji, Hanni, and Danielle. Recently, after careful consideration, we have decided to return to ADOR. One of the members is currently in Antarctica, so the announcement of our position was delayed, but since ADOR has not responded to us, we have been forced to share our decision separately. We will continue to show you our sincere music and performances. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement was found to be odd by many, especially considering the continued severed communication between some of the members and the label. Later, the management shared an update on the trio&rsquo;s statement and shared another vague response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are currently looking into the real intentions of the three members&rsquo; statement to return,&rdquo; shared ADOR with Sports Ilgan after learning about Minji, Danielle, and Hanni&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is reported by NewDaily that it was Hyein&rsquo;s father who convinced Haerin&rsquo;s family to let her join back. He was previously rumored to have opposed terminating the group&rsquo;s contract with ADOR and then convinced his own daughter, as well as her fellow <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/will-newjeans-finally-return-to-ador-members-set-one-non-negotiable-condition-amid-august-14-mediation-1394460">NewJeans</a> member, to return. An alleged custody battle also began between Hyein&rsquo;s mother and father over her removal from the label amid NewJeans&rsquo; dispute with HYBE.</p>

On November 12, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/can-newjeans-hiatus-push-their-ador-contract-beyond-2030-all-we-know-about-suspension-clause-causing-fan-alarm-1392108">ADOR</a> shared a statement on the girl group&rsquo;s social media confirming their intentions to continue as a part of their talent. They have asked to refrain from unfounded rumors and give the utmost support to the two.</p>

<p><strong>Haerin and Hyein return to ADOR and thereby NewJeans</strong><br />
ADOR&rsquo;s statement shared on Wednesday read as follows, &ldquo;We at ADOR would like to inform you. NewJeans members Hyein and Haerin have expressed their intention to continue their activities with ADOR.<br />
After careful consultation with their families and thorough discussions with ADOR,<br />
the two members have made the decision to respect the court&#39;s ruling and comply with the exclusive contract. ADOR will do its utmost to ensure that Hyein and Haerin can continue their entertainment activities smoothly. We kindly ask for the warm support of our fans and respectfully request that you refrain from any unfounded speculation regarding the members. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Minji, Hanni, and Danielle have yet to comment on their fellow members&rsquo; decision to join hands with their management after over a year of dispute. Recently, the five lost their case against ADOR in relation to the validity of their exclusive contracts. Earlier, the group argued for the removal of Min Hee Jin as the CEO of their management company and wished for her reinstatement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The label has denied the same and has appointed Lee Do Kyung as its new CEO. They have also refused mismanagement allegations and provided financial statements as proof. It is not known how NewJeans will proceed with the absence of three out of its five members. Fans have had mixed reactions to the announcement of Haerin and Hyein&rsquo;s return.</p>

According to reports on November 12, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/ives-jang-wonyoung-and-2pms-lee-junho-confirmed-as-mcs-for-10th-asia-artist-awards-2025-know-when-its-happening-1381719">IVE</a> member bought a new property at the famed Hannam-dong area in Seoul, South Korea. A unit at the UN Village bears the 21-year-old&rsquo;s name loud and proud, an achievement rare as it comes among 4th-generation K-pop stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jang Wonyoung adds a new real estate property to her net worth</strong></p>

<p>As per the real estate industry and the Supreme Court Registry Office, in a copy acquired by Hankook Kyungjae TV, the singer signed on a 244 sq. meter unit in Lucid House, located in Yongsan-gu, Hannam-dong, Seoul, this March for 13.7 billion KRW (approximately 9.3 million USD). It is said that Jang Wonyoung completed the registration process for the home last month. The feat is even more impressive as it appears that the former IZ*ONE member bought it with no mortgage, leading to assumptions that it was paid for in full cash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, when the particular establishment was first put on sale, it came up to a whopping 4 billion KRW already. The price has appreciated massively in the last 8 years, growing more than three times its original value in such a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within the UN Village, the unit bought by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/are-bts-v-and-ives-jang-wonyoung-dating-alleged-proof-list-surfaces-on-internet-about-k-pop-stars-lovestagram-1397245">Jang Wonyoung</a> is said to be a part of the Lucid House project. It previously housed actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/top-10-highest-paid-korean-actresses-of-all-time-1217905">Kim Tae Hee</a>, who reportedly made over 2 billion KRW profit on it. Meanwhile, the young singer remains an industry favorite, winning with her charms and influence, having become the face of multiple brands over the years. Her market presence and the success of IVE had made her one of the top idols, earning her numerous endorsements individually and as a group.</p>

The actor has seemingly picked his next roles, and this time he&rsquo;ll be eyeing the big screen instead of returning to the small ones. According to a report from SPOTV News, the 35-year-old will be starring in Veteran 3 alongside Hwang Jung Min. The movie series has been a Box Office favorite, with the past 2 instalments selling millions of tickets across the country.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/king-the-land-star-lee-junho-undergoes-intense-investigation-for-possible-tax-evasion-report-1364366">Lee Junho</a> may join the revered team of Veteran alongside the titular character played by Hwang Jung Min. It is not yet known what role will be entrusted to the star. He follows a succession of famous young actors joining the film franchise and earning praise for their portrayals. Previously, Yoo Ah In and Jung Hae In have acted in parts 1 and 2 of the series, respectively. Now it remains to be seen whether Lee Junho will follow a similar path and add an action role to his filmography after success with rom-coms.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Veteran film franchise</strong><br />
The Veteran series is of the action crime investigation drama genre, directed by Ryoo Seung Wan. The films tell the story of a veteran detective named Seo Do Cheol (Hwang Jung Min), who tries his best to catch criminals and bring victims to justice.</p>

<p>The first film, released in 2015, was a blockbuster at the Box Office, reportedly gathering 13.41 million viewers over its run. Meanwhile, Veteran 2, which was officially called I, the Executioner, also became a box office hit, attracting 7.52 million viewers amid the low turnout experienced by theaters across the globe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lee Junho is currently enjoying the success of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-junho-kim-min-has-typhoon-family-ott-release-date-time-how-to-watch-online-cast-and-plot-1397531">Typhoon Family</a> alongside <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/took-great-care-of-me-kim-min-ha-reveals-how-pachinko-2-co-star-lee-min-ho-made-her-feel-comfortable-on-set-1338234">Kim Min Ha</a>.

She has been revealed to be a part of the festival with many famed personalities like herself, including Foo Fighters, Florence + The Machine, Twenty One Pilots, Lorde, Pulp, Wolf Alice, Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds, Moby, and many more. Over 70 artists have been announced as a part of the lineup.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie to headline Mad Cool Festival</strong><br />
Jennie is all set to become the first-ever K-pop act to headline Madrid&rsquo;s Mad Cool Festival, and she&rsquo;s doing so alongside many well-known artists. As a co-headliner, the BLACKPINK member will be performing on Thursday, July 9, 2026. Other performers on the same day include Florence + The Machine, Lorde, Teddy Swims, Zara Larsson, Rene&eacute; Rapp, Charlie Puth, The Blaze, and more.</p>

<p>While her first-ever headliner gig in Spain, this is hardly the first time the songstress has led a music festival. She performed in front of thousands and made them go crazy with her moves earlier this year at Coachella. The tracks from Ruby truly made everyone wish they were Jennie as her songs rose back on music charts and garnered thousands of streams soon after. She trended on social media with &lsquo;Jenchella&rsquo; becoming a top search item and hashtag, proving her global reach and influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jennie is currently in the middle of the BLACKPINK DEADLINE World Tour with Jisoo, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa, as they take over the globe in sold-out concerts. The team is looking to release a new album by the end of this year, with some reports claiming the record has been <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/has-blackpinks-album-been-pushed-to-january-2026-yg-entertainment-responds-to-rumors-of-december-cancelation-1398265">pushed to 2026</a>.</p>

While there have been many rumors of him dating various celebrities and non-celebrities, the singer has yet to settle down for good. Appearing on MBC&#39;s Son Seok Hee&#39;s Questions program, where he was last seen about 10 years ago, the superstar was asked about his plans to tie the knot. Maintaining that he had not found the person he could marry so far, he tried to manifest his wedding. As usual, his humor was top-notch as he joked about hoping that the person listening to this would probably make it happen, adding not much burden to himself about finding a partner.</p>

<p><strong>BIGBANG&#39;s GD reveals thoughts on marriage</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/g-dragon-to-send-his-music-to-space-rapper-becomes-first-korean-artist-and-second-after-the-beatles-to-join-nasa-project-1381539">G-Dragon</a> was asked about when he plans to get married. &ldquo;I&#39;ll get married when it&#39;s time,&rdquo; he said, repeating his past words about when he was asked about his military enlistment. The host affirmed that it&#39;s truly the correct answer, seeing how he had managed to enlist and get discharged from the military in good health without rushing it.<br />
&ldquo;It&#39;s a world that I&rsquo;ve never been to and really want to go to, so I get excited thinking about it,&rdquo; he added when asked about how he was glowing the most while talking about his marriage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most unknown territory for me at this point in my life.</p>

<p>So far, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bigbang-to-disband-soon-g-dragon-reacts-to-speculations-on-good-day-preview-i-came-back-1375476">BIGBANG</a> group mate <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bigbang-reunion-g-dragon-and-taeyang-make-special-appearances-at-daesungs-solo-ds-wave-2025-asia-concert-1384779">Taeyang</a> has gotten married to longtime girlfriend Min Hyo Rin, and the two have also welcomed their first child. Addressing how he felt on experiencing that GD shared, &ldquo;Seeing our members, how Taeyang got married, and the kid&rsquo;s father is my friend. When I met him, seeing myself introduce [myself] to his son, &#39;Hello kid, I&#39;m your dad&#39;s friend&#39; is so fascinating. So I&rsquo;m hoping it would happen to me sometime as well.&rdquo; The singer expressed anticipation of it and worry for the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He ended his imagination with, &ldquo;I don&#39;t even know who&#39;s gonna be my future partner, but anyway, know that I want to get married. If I say this, then someone will eventually come to me, right?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

YG Entertainment responds to rumors of December cancelation]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-11/421330598_blackpink.webp"></img><p>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s long-awaited comeback has an update, and we&rsquo;re not sure if you were waiting for this one after all. According to a Star Today report on November 6, the girl group&rsquo;s comeback has been postponed to January 2026. This news comes in the middle of questions about a possible new album being released in November or December 2025. YG Entertainment has reacted to the news, sharing that the exact dates will be announced later, while the album remains in the final stages of preparation at the moment, their vague stance has been a constant this year.</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK eyes a comeback next year with new music</strong><br />
Previous reports claimed that a mini album was in the making, set for a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-release-new-mini-album-in-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-comeback-news-will-announce-1395402">November drop</a>. However, later the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-drop-full-length-album-in-december-not-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-reports-1397743">schedule was changed to December</a>, citing quality and a full-length album release instead. Now, it seems that BLACKPINK will release no more new music this year and stick to their ongoing DEADLINE world tour instead. Responding to the reports of the January release plan, YG Entertainment said as per Newsen, &ldquo;The album is in the final stages of being musically perfected. We will share good news through official promotions as soon as preparations are complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And while the label has not officially confirmed anything, many have taken this response as the sign they needed that the album has indeed been postponed. The exact reasons for the postponement are unknown, but it seems that the girls need more time amid an ongoing global tour, which is set to end in January 2026, but rumors claim it will be extended through the next year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the management label confirmed that the group had filmed the music video already and is doing the rest of the work on the record. Meanwhile, the album will be the team&rsquo;s first in over 3 years and follows the release of their single <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jump-music-video-broke-the-internet-know-how-they-gained-more-likes-than-views-on-youtube-1393540">JUMP</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

It was announced on the same day on their social media accounts that the members and YY Entertainment had ended their relationship with mutual agreement. TOZ comprised of Anthonny, Hart, Yuto, and Takuto, who were formed after the end of Boys Planet, as each one of them was eliminated and unable to be a part of the final lineup, which birthed ZEROBASEONE. Here&rsquo;s how the announcement of their disbandment was made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello,<br />
This is YY Entertainment.<br />
After long and careful discussions regarding TOZ&rsquo;s current situation and future, we have mutually agreed to conclude TOZ&rsquo;s group activities.<br />

We are deeply grateful for the passion and dedication the members of TOZ have shown throughout our journey together.<br />

<p>On the other hand, K-pop boy group OnlyOneOf, which debuted in 2019 and has continued to impress with the concepts and presence, decided not to renew their contracts with their agency, 8D Entertainment.

Initially a seven-piece band, Love left in 2021, with KB going independent in August 2025. Rie, Yoojung, Junji, Mill, and Nine are the remaining members, with KB&rsquo;s future in the team unknown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.<br />
This is 8D Entertainment.<br />
We are letting you know that our management of OnlyOneOf has come to an end.<br />
We would like to sincerely thank the lyOn (OnlyOneof&rsquo;s fans) who have supported the artists with their unchanging love for a long time.<br />

Having enlisted for his mandatory national duty on July 28, 2025, he has <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/astros-cha-eun-woo-gets-caught-by-senior-soldier-for-hiding-this-during-military-meal-what-is-in-your-pockets-1396593">been in the headlines</a> for his &lsquo;face genius&rsquo; presence even at his training base. This time, however, he has more to credit as the singer and actor has been chosen to become the host of the APEC Summit Welcome Dinner Cultural Performance at Lahan Select Hotel&rsquo;s Grand Ballroom in Gyeongju. He was spotted making his way to the event on October 30, and his charming personality even left the industrialists and reporters stunned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cha Eun Woo gets a special invite to be the host of a business event</strong></p>

<p>While uncommon for an active duty soldier to be a part of a business event during his service, it was reported by News1 that the government&rsquo;s APEC Summit Preparatory Planning Committee sent an official document to the Ministry of National Defense in early October to inquire whether Cha Eun Woo could appear as the host of the event. It is said that the Ministry of National Defense approved the request according to the relevant regulations, citing the promotion of national interests and civil-military cooperation as the reason for allowing him to participate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is known that BIGBANG leader G-Dragon will be performing as a special guest at the same ceremony, said to be in the presence of world leaders. Previously, BTS member <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/rm-compares-k-pop-to-korean-dish-bibimbap-says-he-was-lucky-to-meet-bts-and-army-we-sang-on-streets-1398061">RM appeared at the summit</a> as the first-ever K-pop star, where he was seated alongside policymakers and executives of some of the biggest companies. He urged businessmen, as a creator himself, to help promote and provide opportunities for their growth. His keynote speech marked a highlight of the evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Cha Eun Woo has long been praised for his handsome visuals even during the military and continues to do some side quests, including the release of a movie, a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/watch-astros-cha-eun-woo-unveils-teaser-for-his-dark-and-emotional-solo-album-else-1397947">new album</a>, a K-drama, and more.&nbsp;</p>

As of October 31, the fans of the famed K-pop boy group <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-group-members-1365104">EXO</a> have officially sold out all the seats for their upcoming fan meeting in December. Previously, it was announced that six members of the team would be participating in their promotions starting this year-end, when they will finally reunite with their fandom. Members <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-express-wish-to-promote-with-exo-amid-album-news-made-efforts-to-promote-as-full-group-1398066">Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin</a> were left out of the announcement, and a statement war ensued between the two sides. Now, despite earlier concerns, the tickets for EXO&rsquo;verse, scheduled for December 14, 2025, at 2 pm and 7 pm, have all been sold out.</p>

<p>The fan club pre-sale for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">EXO&rsquo;verse</a> began on October 30, and shortly after, it went out of stock! To be held at the Inspire Arena in Incheon, SM Entertainment confirmed the sold-out status of the fan meeting on October 31. The last such event held by the group was the ONE fan meeting held in April 2024. This time, Chinese member Lay has gladly joined the group celebrations and also plans to be a part of the upcoming comeback, their first in many years as a team.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin try to get included in EXO&rsquo;s plans</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dispute with EXO-CBX unit members Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin is continuing, with both sides not claiming responsibility for the lack of involvement in the concert and album prep. INB100, the trio&rsquo;s new agency, continues to claim that they have emptied all schedules for the artists in December, to facilitate their participation in EXO promotions. Meanwhile, SM Entertainment has claimed that the three have broken trust and hurt the other members as well as fans, while also not paying their 10% dues according to their contract with the agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the intent to join the project, as well as the practical difficulties that stand in the way of the three, many fans are worried about the possibility of them being a part of the 2026 first-quarter album.&nbsp;</p>

After rumors of a romantic relationship between actors <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-yoo-jung-and-kim-do-hoons-agencies-put-a-full-stop-to-their-dating-news-reveal-why-they-were-in-vietnam-1397057">Kim Yoo Jung and Kim Do Hoon</a> surfaced on the internet, it appeared that the K-drama would suffer repercussions. However, the stars recently revealed their initial reactions after reading the news. The two seemingly joked about it, not letting the rumors affect their friendship. Speaking about it at a press conference on October 30, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/dear-x-filming-hwang-in-yeop-kim-yoo-jungs-debut-onscreen-pairing-is-a-visual-treat-watch-1378138">Dear X</a> director Lee Eung Bok even teased them about having more photos of the two actors. Meanwhile, Kim Young Dae, who could not join them on the trip back then, seemed just as curious as the rest of the world to know the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Dear X stars react to Kim Yoo Jung and Kim Do Hoon&rsquo;s dating rumors</strong><br />
According to a report from Newsis, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/kim-yoo-jung-was-scared-to-take-on-dear-x-role-with-kim-young-dae-reveals-what-convinced-her-1391600">Kim Yoo Jung</a> shared how she felt after reading about it, &ldquo;At that time, we had just finished the Busan promotion schedule and everyone was scattered. We got on a call immediately after the news broke, so the moment we started talking, we ended up laughing over it for about 3 minutes.&rdquo; The actress spoke about making a jest of the situation with the director, and thanks to the attention, hoped the drama would do well.</p>

<p>Kim Do Hoon added that they really laughed a lot. Meanwhile, Lee Eung Bok, finding the situation hilarious, was willing to maximize the fun,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to provide a few more photos [as proof]. I secured them last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Male lead, Kim Young Dae, who had been quiet during the interaction, responded, &ldquo;Honestly, I didn&rsquo;t know anything. I had no idea. And to be honest, this is a bit of TMI; I couldn&rsquo;t go with them. I really didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, or whether it was real or not. I even called to ask them seriously, &lsquo;Are you really dating?&rsquo; But they said it wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously, Kim Yoo Jung and Kim Do Hoon were embroiled in dating rumors back in May of this year after photos of the two traveling in Vietnam were posted on an online community. Both their agencies swiftly denied the same and added, &quot;It wasn&#39;t just the two of them. It was a production retreat with people who had free time after filming Dear X.&quot;</p>

The question has long been on the minds of the fans who have time and again been given vague responses. Now, a new report by News1 has emerged claiming that the actor would be a part of the anniversary celebrations after adjusting his schedule. It said that the star took part in the filming, with excitement being placed on his alleged reunion with his co-star and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/know-all-about-hyeri-and-ryu-jun-yeols-past-relationship-1292094">ex-girlfriend of 7 years, Lee Hyeri</a>. Now, the production has stepped in to debunk all rumors and shared that Ryu Jun Yeol did not join the celebration trip but instead participated in the commemoration via separate means.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hyeri and Ryu Jun Yeol avoid running into each other but show respect for the past project</strong><br />
Ryu Jun Yeol was expected to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reply-1988-plans-10th-anniversary-trip-ryu-jun-yeol-opts-out-amid-concerns-of-possible-clash-with-ex-lover-hyeri-1395526">skip the 10th anniversary celebration</a>&nbsp;of Reply 1988 due to scheduling conflicts with his ongoing project shoot.

However, now, tvN has responded to the latest claims of his participation in the retreat. &ldquo;Although Ryu Jun Yeol was unable to join the group retreat due to scheduling issues, he adjusted his schedule to take part in portions of the filming in honor of the 10th anniversary of Reply 1988.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is clear that the actor did not physically attend the filming but instead pre-shot content for the celebration. Previously, it was reported that the Reply 1988 production team had organized a cast and crew reunion, including an overseas group retreat and other content shot for a variety program. It was later revealed that the cast took a trip to Gangwon Province and not an international retreat, in October, for their 10th-anniversary celebration, and filmed it for a broadcast of a variety program. It is said that some scenes also featured the National Folk Museum of Korea for an exhibit on the era.&nbsp;</p>

Previously, the trio&rsquo;s agency shared that they were surprised to learn about the upcoming fan meeting and album plans by the group, which would exclude the EXO-CBX members. And although they have expressed their wish to promote as a part of the group and cleared their December schedules, they were not included in the activities.</p>

<p>On October 29, SM Entertainment responded to INB100&rsquo;s statement, which claimed that they had agreed to all conditions stated by the former for Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin&rsquo;s participation in year-end promotions and a new album. The former shared its stance that it had requested the trio pay 10 percent of their revenue from individual activities as per their initial contract, but had yet to receive it. Moreover, it claimed that the many &ldquo;unreasonable lawsuits have not only significantly destroyed trust between our two sides, but have also caused great harm to the group EXO and wounded both the fans and the members. Therefore, it was only natural that the trio should first fulfill the terms of the existing agreement and demonstrate a sincere effort to restore trust.&ldquo;</p>

<p>SM Entertainment&rsquo;s side continues to claim that due to the unfulfilled contractual dues and broken trust, they find it deeply regrettable that CBX&rsquo;s side tried to &lsquo;distort the truth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, a new statement has been shared by the trio&rsquo;s agency, INB100, refuting their former management&rsquo;s stance. They relayed that the unit wishes to pay 10% of revenue; however, they would like to wait till the end of their lawsuit is reached. As for the &lsquo;wounds&rsquo; caused to EXO, they intend to be part of the upcoming group promotions, &ldquo;All discussions proceeded on the premise of &#39;EXO full-group activities.&rsquo; CBX made clear their intent to perform the existing agreement, were communicating directly with the members, and have been striving to be together as part of the group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin continue to be in a stalemate position with SM Entertainment, and it is not yet known whether they will participate in the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">EXO&rsquo;verse fan meeting</a> or the 2026 first quarter comeback.</p>

Amid the dispute over the validity of their contracts and their promotions with the team, a new announcement affirming their absence from an upcoming album and fan meeting was shared by SM Entertainment. Now, their new label INB100 has shared their stance, denying the rumors of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusive-xiumin-chen-on-first-snow-challenge-with-baekhyun-what-they-knew-about-india-message-for-exo-ls-and-more-1368070">Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin</a>&rsquo;s refusal to participate in the projects and expressing willingness to be a part of the group activities starting this December.</p>

<p><strong>EXO&#39;s&nbsp;Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin wish to promote with the group for the 2026 album and upcoming fan meeting</strong></p>

<p>On October 29, INB100 shared a detailed statement recounting their attempts to have Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin promote with the rest of the six EXO members. Earlier, an announcement from their former agency shared that only <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exo-announces-december-fanmeeting-and-new-album-including-lay-chen-baekhyun-and-xiumin-missing-amid-feud-1398007">Suho, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, Sehun, and Lay</a> would be a part of the upcoming fan meet called EXO&lsquo;verse, as well as an album which will be released in the first quarter of 2026. The obscurity on CBX&rsquo;s future with the team comes amid the label and the trio&rsquo;s legal fight over contracts, settlements, signing witha&nbsp; new label, and more issues following their departure from SM Entertainment.</p>

<p>In their statement INB100 claimed that, &ldquo;Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin promised fans that, as members of EXO, they would take part in full-group activities, and we have been making every possible effort to honor that promise.&rdquo; They then detailed instances throughout the year where the agency attempted to sort out the matters with their former label. The following are the steps taken according to a report from Newsen.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>July 9, 2025 &mdash; First confirmation of intent to reach an agreement with SM Entertainment. We met directly with SM to confirm the direction and willingness for an agreement over EXO&rsquo;s full-group promotions.</li>
	<li>September 10, 2025 &mdash; Mutual sharing of specific terms. Both sides entered the stage of practical negotiations and exchanged specific agreement details.</li>
	<li>Full acceptance of SM&rsquo;s demands. After the second mediation date (October 2), EXO-CBX clearly communicated their intention to reach an agreement by accepting all of SM&#39;s conditions for EXO&#39;s full-group comeback at the end of the year.</li>
	<li>Schedule adjustments prioritizing EXO activities In order to promote as a full group, they cleared all of their personal schedules in December and waited for SM&#39;s final response through their legal representatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>They added that while making the above efforts for EXO-CBX&#39;s promotions, they received an announcement regarding the holding of an EXO fan meeting and the release of a full album, which excluded EXO-CBX. Moreover, the statement revealed that the three have &lsquo;valued the sincerity of their long-time fans&rsquo; and wish for full-group activities, hence choosing the path of agreement, hoping to reach one as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether SM Entertainment is willing to negotiate any terms for the possibility of having Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin promote with the group.</p>

Speaking to a room full of industrialists and policy makers. Yet again, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-rm-goes-namjooning-post-military-fans-believe-hell-join-jimin-and-jungkook-for-are-you-sure-part-2-1392241">Kim Namjoon</a>&nbsp;impressed with his creative, impactful, and impressive speech, where he likened K-pop to the versatility of Korean food called bibimbap and praised his team&rsquo;s efforts to break down language and cultural barriers. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-to-go-on-biggest-tour-ever-with-65-stops-including-30-shows-in-north-america-2026-comeback-plans-revealed-1398004">BTS</a> leader&nbsp;also asked for more opportunities for creators like himself to explore and progress in the world, earning applause.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RM cites his fortune for the success of BTS</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#39;m very lucky. I met the six members of BTS, producer &quot;hitman&quot; Bang, who has given me unwavering support so I can focus on the music I want to create, and most importantly, I&#39;ve met ARMY, a global community that embraces our music not as mere entertainment, but as a language of life.&rdquo; He followed up with a shoutout to his fans, which we&rsquo;re sure he greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>RM added that the West was wary of the team&rsquo;s art, and BTS&#39;&nbsp;music was categorized as &lsquo;non-English culture,&rsquo; but they decided to take on the challenge of entering mainstream broadcasting platforms. For doing so, the seven members took on a hands-on approach,&nbsp;&ldquo;To create our own opportunities, we even danced and sang on the streets, handing out free concert flyers,&rdquo; but when that wasn&rsquo;t enough, they decided to go deeper and try harder.</p>

<p>He compared the very music his group makes to the traditional Korean dish bibimbap. &ldquo;K-pop embraces Western musical elements like hip-hop, R&amp;B, and EDM without rejecting them, while also fusing them with unique Korean aesthetics, emotions, and production systems. Like bibimbap, these disparate elements, while maintaining their own distinct identities, blend together to create a new result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His visionary take has left a great deal of influence on viewers, as he also asked APEC leaders to provide finances and more opportunities for others like him around the world.&nbsp;</p>

The singer has reportedly purchased a high-end home in the popular area of Gangnam in Seoul, South Korea, and some details about this new buy will have you wide-eyed. Called the L&rsquo;ARBRE 27, it is a luxury villa complex in the city that adds to her real estate portfolio. It is said that only 27 units were available in the project, all of which have now been sold out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Jisoo invests in extravagant property in South Korea</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s said that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-drop-full-length-album-in-december-not-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-reports-1397743">BLACKPINK</a>&rsquo;s Jisoo and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/bts-agency-chairman-bang-si-hyuk-faces-indictment-over-alleged-400-billion-krw-stock-fraud-hybe-reacts-1393256">Bang Sihyuk</a> are both set to move in soon, making the YG Entertainment singer and the founder of rival company HYBE neighbors at the villa. Their houses will rival some of the best in the town. Other properties owned by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jisoo-marks-billboard-hot-100-debut-with-eyes-closed-featuring-zayn-malik-marks-big-milestone-for-blackpink-1397871">Jisoo</a> include a unit at Hannam The Hill, where BTS member Jin and actor So Ji Sub are said to have properties of their own, and an office in the same area, for her own company called BLISSOO, which she started with her brother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to reports on October 29, including one from Koreaboo, the selling price of some of the penthouse units is said to be 45 billion KRW (approximately 31.6 million USD), making it one of the most pricey villas in Gangnam. Meanwhile, the regular units reportedly cost around 20 billion KRW (approximately 14 million USD). The residential complex is said to be under construction at the moment, with two buildings having five floors underground to seven floors above ground.</p>

<p>The Korean singer seems to be planning well for her future by investing in trustworthy and upscale real estate projects, which would eventually yield her high returns. On the other hand, she continues to expand her music and acting career, going on a world tour with teammates Jennie, Ros&eacute;, and Lisa.</p>

Having been confirmed for the lead roles, the possibility of them taking on high schooler versions has seemingly become a reality. Recently, an extra on the set shared behind-the-scenes photos from Wife of 21st Century Prince were shared online and spread like wildfire on social media. Thus, the rumors of the two actors also going back in time to their high school era began taking form.&nbsp;</p>

The rumors say that Byeon Woo Seok and IU may not have used younger doubles to take on their roles as children, but instead took on the job themselves, stepping back into uniforms. The almost-34-year-old and the 32-year-old are no strangers to the dandy styling of Korean high school uniforms, but it is rather rare to see actors in their early thirties do so, and past instances of such have always invited admiration from fans.&nbsp;</p>

The latest episodes have invited anger from netizens and fans of the show alike for their portrayal of a young s*xual crime offender. After putting up supporting content promoting its scenes with inappropriate captions, the channel has had to take down the videos.</p>

<p><strong>Bae Nara and Shin Seulgi starrer educational scene backfires on the channel</strong></p>

<p>A scene starring supporting actors <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/whats-next-for-weak-hero-class-2-villain-bae-na-ra-check-out-two-major-k-dramas-on-actors-schedule-1387757">Bae Nara</a> and Shin Seulki, who play each other&rsquo;s love interests, showed them at a morning run. One young boy is shown taking photos of the actress performing CPR on a patient who falls sick, and her body gets exposed. Meanwhile, the actor is shown offering his own jacket to her in a stern tone, asking her to &lsquo;cover up&rsquo; and later beating up the boy for his offense. He is then seen rattling off the legal implications of the act and personally deleting the images, letting him run away after the warning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many online users found the entire scene very offensive, with the actor&rsquo;s dialogue and lack of proper repercussions irking them. They demanded appropriate legal steps be taken instead to make offenders aware of their crime, instead of the light slap on the wrist effect displayed in the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SBS later shared promotional clips, titling them, &lsquo;Rich kid caught secretly filming Shin Seulki, Bae Nara gives a satisfying lesson.&rsquo; However, it further angered audiences, prompting the broadcaster to delete all related content in fear of affecting the viewership.</p>

Here’s what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-10/610630225_lisa-tangled.webp"></img><p>Lisa may be eyeing her big Hollywood break next! The Thai singer, rapper, dancer, and actor has been making waves thanks to her big moves in the entertainment industry. Every week, she&rsquo;s out there pulling out new stops to make her name spread more far and wide than anyone had expected, and this time around, she may become the latest big Disney star. According to insiders, the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpink-to-drop-full-length-album-in-december-not-november-yg-entertainment-reacts-to-reports-1397743">BLACKPINK</a> member is in talks to become Rapunzel, the beloved princess who&rsquo;s the face of the animated film Tangled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa in the race for Rapunzel&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Making her acting debut with The White Lotus Season 3, where she embodied the sly hotelier Mook, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lisa-picks-debut-korean-acting-project-blackpink-star-joins-ma-dong-seok-and-lee-jin-wook-in-extraction-tigo-1397712">Lisa</a> seems to be onto her next project. She is reportedly being considered for the role of Rapunzel in the highly awaited live-action adaptation of the Disney film Tangled. After facing trouble in finding success with their Snow White remake starring Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot, the studio seems to be aiming for a high-profile lead star who would bring them the revenue and the eyeballs, and Lisa seems to be the perfect pick for it.</p>

<p>If true, acting in the Tangled adaptation would skyrocket her already sparkling career, and make the BLACKPINK singer one of the most famed stars among her peers&mdash; if she wasn&rsquo;t already. According to an update from a Hollywood casting insider, several names are being screened for the role of Rapunzel, including Sarah Catherine Hook, Aimee Lou Wood, Charlotte Le Bon, Sydney Sweeney, and Lisa. Previously, the reports about a star from The White Lotus universe were being discussed, but online users have zeroed in on it being Lisa, if not Aimee Loud Wood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, the production has not commented on the possibility and has neither confirmed the live-action after indefinitely postponing it earlier this year. Another report previously claimed that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-scarlett-johansson-joining-tangled-live-action-find-out-as-film-talks-proceed-at-disney-1397606">Scarlett Johansson</a> was picked for the role of Mother Gothel, the evil woman who imprisons Rapunzel in a tower.&nbsp;</p>
