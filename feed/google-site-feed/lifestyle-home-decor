Instead of saving everything for just one day, why not turn a whole week leading up to it into a dessert-filled countdown? With thoughtfully crafted treats and signature flavours, this seven-day plan lets you celebrate love in delicious ways, all inspired by favourites from the menu. With a curated list of treats across Theobroma&rsquo;s offerings, here is a list of treats for planning a romantic countdown that feels playful, indulgent, and undeniably special:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 1: Start with a classic box of brownies</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Kick off the countdown with a box of rich, indulgent <a href="https://theobroma.in/collections/brownies">brownies</a> that never fail to impress. Theobroma&rsquo;s choco chip brownie is ideal for setting the tone as it is dense, fudgy, and deeply comforting. This delicious brownie, topped with tiny sugar confetti hearts, is like a heart served on a platter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 2: Keep it cute with a strawberry cupcake</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Day two is all about small joys. A strawberry cupcake delivers strawberry jam with butter and strawberry frosting, making it ideal for a midweek treat. It is indulgent yet light enough to enjoy without saving it for a &#39;special moment&#39;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 3: Add crunch with a box of almond rocks</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Midweek calls for something a little different from the usual. Almond rocks bring together roasted nuts and rich chocolate, offering texture and balance in every bite. They&rsquo;re perfect for gifting, sharing, or enjoying slowly, one piece at a time.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 4: Turn up the romance with a red velvet cake</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As Valentine&rsquo;s Day draws closer, it&rsquo;s time for a showstopper. A red velvet cake, with its signature colour of love and smooth cream cheese frosting, adds elegance and romance to the countdown. It&rsquo;s ideal for celebrating milestones or planning a cosy dinner date at home.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 5: Enjoy a creamy cheesecake</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Compact, creamy, and irresistibly indulgent, the <a href="https://theobroma.in/products/valentines-lotus-biscoff-bento-cheesecake-320g">lotus biscoff bento cheesecake</a> is made for intimate celebrations. Its creamy notes and smooth texture, along with the caramelised lotus, make it perfect for couples who prefer something rich yet refined, proof that small desserts can still feel luxurious.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 6: Indulge in a pastry for a chocolate-forward moment</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Some Valentine&rsquo;s treats don&rsquo;t need grand gestures; they shine through pure flavour. The Dutch truffle pastry is perfect for days when you want something rich, smooth, and intensely chocolatey without committing to a full cake. With its soft sponge, silky truffle layers, and balanced sweetness, it feels indulgent yet effortless.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day 7: Create a Valentine&rsquo;s dessert moment</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">End the countdown by combining the treats you loved most throughout the week. A slice of cake, a creamy cheesecake, and a few chocolate bites create a dessert spread that feels personal and celebratory, perfect for a relaxed Valentine&rsquo;s evening.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Celebrating Valentine&rsquo;s Day over seven days turns simple desserts into meaningful moments. With a thoughtful mix of flavours, textures, and treats, the countdown becomes less about excess and more about intention, making every day leading up to Valentine&rsquo;s feel just as special as the day itself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/heres-why-neil-nitin-mukesh-thinks-toxic-bollywood-enjoys-someones-failure-1387157">Neil Nitin Mukesh</a> shared that he personally designed the interiors of his home. The day of the housewarming was also the day of his Roka ceremony, when his wife Rukmini entered the house for the first time. Later, during the COVID-19 lockdown, the couple spent special moments there with their daughter, Nurvi.</p>

<p>The house was originally designed as a bachelor pad, featuring unique materials like brick walls, cement finishes&nbsp;and battlet onyx. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no paint on the walls,&rdquo; Neil said. &ldquo;We live near the sea, and I wanted to avoid dampness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Artistic touches and vaastu-approved d&eacute;cor</strong></p>

<p>Neil&rsquo;s love for art is evident in every corner. His living room features a console designed by Pinakin and two artworks by his friend Niyati Kanakia. &ldquo;This is my favourite artwork,&rdquo; he said, pointing to one piece made entirely from magazine paper.</p>

<p>He also highlighted a stunning African Tiger Onyx wall, imported from Africa and installed by Elegant Marble. &ldquo;This direction was coming as Agni, so I got the idea to clad that wall,&rdquo; Neil explained.</p>

<p>In his bedroom, Neil opted for cozy tones with a hotel-like feel. The door frames are made of marble, and the guest room, once a TV room, has a travertine marble wall and a sleek lacquer-polished table.</p>

<p>From spirituality to design, Neil Nitin Mukesh&rsquo;s house reflects his artistic side, deep beliefs, and cherished memories, making it truly one-of-a-kind.</p>

<p><strong>Trying to Fit Every Trend:</strong> Mixing too many trends can make the decor look cluttered and impersonal.</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring Scale &amp; Proportion: </strong>Oversized elements in small venues or minimal decor in large spaces can disrupt the aesthetic balance.</p>

<p><strong>Not Prioritizing Impact Zones:</strong> Couples often spread their budget thin instead of investing in areas that matter most- like the mandap, entrance, and key photo-op spots.</p>

But later, Doshi shared yet another tweet clarifying the exorbitant charges and wrote, &ldquo;Mumbai folks, back me up! This is what good Maharajs charge in decent localities. The same cook charges&nbsp;Rs 2.5k a day for a family of 12 isn&rsquo;t overcharging, it&rsquo;s just how things work here,&rdquo; she posted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no, it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;engagement farming.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s just real-life experience in one of the most expensive cities in the country. If you can&rsquo;t relate, maybe just accept the difference in cost of living and keep scrolling instead of shouting &lsquo;fake&rsquo; in the comments,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Taking to HT.com, Ayushi explained that she agrees Rs 18,000 per household for 2 meals sounds a bit unbelievable, and that&#39;s the reaction she has been getting from many people too.&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, not all cooks charge that much; many charge 10- 12k as well. But if someone is really good, efficient, and has built a reputation, they can charge a premium. The cook I mentioned is known in our entire locality for almost 10 years &amp; the families trust him completely. Good cooks with solid reputations charge that much, and people are willing to pay because they deliver quality, consistency, and speed&rdquo;, she said.</p>

<p>She continued that the cook works for 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the household size. &quot;He works in 10-12 flats in the same complex. So it&rsquo;s very much possible for him to make 1.8- 2 lakhs a month, without any exaggeration,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>Well, this surely does raise eyebrows and sounds unbelievable! Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for more such updates.</p>

Born in America, he has been running his company in Bengaluru for more than a decade. His journey is a testament to identifying opportunity in unexpected places. The fast-casual restaurant chain owned by him introduced California-style Mexican cuisine to India. Here&rsquo;s all you need to know about Bert Meuller.</p>

<h3><strong>Bert Meuller left California at the age of 22 to establish a business in India</strong></h3>

<p>Reportedly, Bert Meuller&rsquo;s idea for California Burrito sparked during his experience in Jaipur in 2010. One of his classmates of Mexican origin brought his native food to a family host in India, and they loved it. Despite his academic background in music and public policy, he recognized a significant business opportunity in bringing Mexican cuisine to India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A year later, Meuller, who was living in California, returned to India in 2011 after completing his education. He was 22 back then. While his friends chose Spain and Europe for opportunities, his unique path led him to build this thriving enterprise in Bengaluru.</p>

<h3><strong>Bert Meuller&rsquo;s California Burrito has a revenue of USD 23 million</strong></h3>

<p>Bert Meuller opened his first restaurant at Embassy Golf Links, Bengaluru, in 2012. He raised USD 250,000 from friends and family for the first location. The success of the Bengaluru restaurant fueled expansion into other major Indian cities like Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Noida, and Gurugram.</p>

<p>California Burrito grew steadily and now boasts over 100 outlets across India. According to CNBC Make It, his company has a revenue of USD 23 million as of 2024.</p>

<p>For the 100th location, the Bangalore-based burrito chain restaurant kept the price of every dish on the menu at Rs 100.</p>

<h3><strong>Bert Mueller likes Karnataka&rsquo;s Jolada Rotti thali with eggplant curry and buttermilk</strong></h3>

<p>Bert Meuller believes in enjoying cross-cultural cuisine. While he brought Mexican food to Bengaluru, he is a fan of Northern Karnataka cuisine. Recently, Mueller visited a popular restaurant in Karnataka to relish Jolada Rotti thali. He had it with eggplant curry and buttermilk.</p>

<p>The dish is typically served with jowar roti, pulses, sambhar, salads, and chutneys.</p>

But for families looking to balance comfort with practicality, two names come up often - the Kia Sonet and the Kia Seltos. Both come from the same family, but they&rsquo;re not cut from the same cloth. One&rsquo;s compact and city-friendly. The other is larger, roomier, and feels closer to a premium ride. So, if your main concern is how these two stack up when it comes to cabin room, boot space, and day-to-day family use, here&rsquo;s a look based entirely on facts, not fluff.</p>

<h2 id="68888a55de59f" style="text-align:justify">First Things First: How Big Are They?</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">It&rsquo;s clear from the start that the Kia Seltos is the larger of the two. You notice it even before stepping inside. It sits longer and has a broader stance. The <a href="https://ackodrive.com/cars/kia-sonet/">Kia Sonet</a>, on the other hand, plays the sub-4 metre game and is designed for tighter city roads.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">You don&rsquo;t need a tape measure to feel the difference. Just getting into the second row of the Seltos, there&rsquo;s more room to stretch your legs, and the wider cabin offers a more relaxed seating posture. In the Sonet, space is decent, but it feels best suited for two adults at the back - three would be a squeeze.</p>

<h2 id="68888a55de5ba" style="text-align:justify">Cabin Layout and Day-to-Day Usability</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Space isn&rsquo;t just about dimensions on paper. It&rsquo;s about how a car uses that space. And here, both the Sonet and Seltos bring their own strengths.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Sonet&#39;s cabin is smartly designed. The dashboard doesn&rsquo;t eat into your knee room, and even though the car is smaller, it doesn&rsquo;t feel cramped in the front row. Storage areas are placed within easy reach, and there&rsquo;s a feeling of snug, well-used space.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The <a href="https://ackodrive.com/cars/kia-seltos/">Kia Seltos</a>, however, offers more openness. You notice it especially when you travel with kids, a grandparent, or even just a group of friends. There&rsquo;s more elbow room. More space between seats. And a slightly larger centre console that adds to the sense of roominess.</p>

<h2 id="68888a55de5c7" style="text-align:justify">Rear Seat Experience: What the Family Feels</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Let&rsquo;s be honest. If you&rsquo;re often the one behind the wheel, you&rsquo;ll care about front-seat comfort. But if you&rsquo;ve got passengers, especially elders or kids, what happens in the back seat matters just as much.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Here&rsquo;s where things get interesting. Both models offer:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Rear AC vents for better air circulation</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">60:40 split-folding rear seats, helpful when you need to carry bags and still fit people</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Rear armrests with cup holders, which your rear passengers will appreciate more than you&rsquo;d expect</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">But the Seltos goes a step further. Thanks to the longer wheelbase, there&rsquo;s extra knee room. On longer drives, this makes a noticeable difference. You also get reclining rear seats, something rare in this segment, which adds a level of comfort you won&rsquo;t want to give up once you&rsquo;ve tried it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In the Sonet, the back seat works well for shorter trips and small families. But if you&rsquo;re regularly ferrying four or five adults, the Seltos clearly has the edge.</p>

<h2 id="68888a55de5ce" style="text-align:justify">Boot Space: Packing for a Weekend or More</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Both SUVs offer decent boot space. For daily use - groceries, a stroller, a couple of cabin-size bags - the Sonet does just fine. It fits what you need without trouble.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">However, the Seltos offers a bit more room, enough to carry those extra bags when you&rsquo;re planning a road trip or heading out of town with family.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Here&rsquo;s a quick recap:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Sonet</strong>: 385 litres</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Seltos</strong>: 433 litres</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">On paper, the difference is just under 50 litres. But practically, that might mean one more suitcase or an extra duffle bag fitting in without stress.</p>

<h2 id="68888a55de5d5" style="text-align:justify">Comfort Tech: Cabin Highlights</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">Both cars don&rsquo;t hold back when it comes to features, especially in the higher trims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Let&rsquo;s compare:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The difference isn&rsquo;t in how the features look, but how they feel. The Seltos cabin is just more polished. The materials have a slightly softer touch, the seats feel broader, and the ambient lighting reflects better in the wider cabin.</p>

<h2 id="68888a55de5dd" style="text-align:justify">Kid-Friendly and Elder-Friendly Additions</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">It&rsquo;s not always about leatherette seats and sunroofs. Real family comfort often hides in smaller details:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>ISOFIX child seat mounts</strong>: Standard in both, making it easier for parents with toddlers.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rear sunshade curtains</strong>: Great during sunny afternoon drives, and both cars offer it.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Smart key with remote engine start</strong>: Handy when you want to cool down the cabin before stepping in.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rear seat headrests and centre armrest</strong>: Both are available, but feel more usable in the Seltos because of the wider space.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify">And here&rsquo;s a thoughtful bit - electric sunroofs. They don&rsquo;t add space, but they do add a sense of openness, especially for kids who like peeking out at the sky on long drives.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify">When the Whole Family&rsquo;s Onboard</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">You&rsquo;ll notice the difference when you&rsquo;re using the car the way families actually do. Taking your parents to the doctor. School drops. Weekend groceries. Outstation weddings. Make picnic plans with your cousins. It&rsquo;s in these real-world scenarios that the Seltos shines a little brighter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">You&rsquo;re not just getting more space&mdash;you&rsquo;re getting flexibility, reclining seats, more usable boot space, more airiness, and a better sound system that fills the larger cabin evenly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Sonet isn&rsquo;t far behind. It does all the basics right. But it&rsquo;s best for smaller families or those who don&rsquo;t travel fully loaded very often.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify">Final Word: Which One Works Best for You?</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify">If your focus is purely on comfort and you&rsquo;re planning to use the vehicle frequently with four or five people onboard, the Kia Seltos just does a better job. It&rsquo;s more relaxed, more generous with space, and designed for families who want room to breathe.</p>

She highlighted that in India, children are often controlled until they are 15 or 16, which hinders their ability to develop independence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She added that a child&rsquo;s intelligence and decision-making skills will not grow if they aren&#39;t allowed to make choices from an early age. Kavyal warned, &quot;Aap aapki puri family barbaad kardoge agar itna micro manage karna hai toh. (You will ruin your family if you insist on micromanaging). And we all have to let go. This is a huge lesson for us.&quot;</p>

<p>The spiritual teacher shared, &quot;We have to let go of the control. Control is not about love. Control is about ego. It&#39;s about our ego. We want to stay important in somebody&#39;s life. We want to stay relevant. That&#39;s not love. There is a very fine line between concern and control.&quot;</p>

<p>Furthermore, Kavyal suggested that parents should serve as a support system in their children&#39;s lives rather than as decision-makers, as this can lead to children feeling the need to distance themselves. She said, &quot;The love of a parent should be so sturdy&quot; so that the child feels safe after he returns home.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Saint Bernard dog sculpture at the entry gate</strong></h3>

<p>Esplanade House has beautiful gardens, marble fountains, and statues which add a unique touch to the mansion.<strong> </strong>The historical gem also has a brown-colored Saint Bernard dog sculpture installed at the entry, right above its main entrance.</p>

<p>Jamsetji Tata&rsquo;s Mumbai mansion, Esplanade House, is not open to the public. Its beautiful decor says it all about the rich heritage in the city. It is also proof that the late industrialist was truly a visionary.</p>

<p><strong>A brief about Jamsetji Tata</strong></p>

<p>Born on March 3, 1839, Jamsetji Tata hailed from a Zoroastrian Parsi family of priests in Navsari, Gujarat. He was the first child and only son of Nusserwanji Tata. The late industrialist worked in his father&#39;s company until he was 29 years old. His father got him enrolled in Elphinstone College in Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jamsetji Tata graduated from the institution as a &#39;green scholar&#39; in 1858. He commissioned the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai in 1903. He was also the founder of Jamshedpur city. He contributed towards the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science, Tata Steel and Tata Power.</p>

He was admitted to the hospital for the same and recently shared his first post after getting discharged.</p>

<p>For those who want to know everything about this procedure, including why it is done and how to prevent this situation, here is the information you need. Keep scrolling further.</p>

<h2 id="68d62dae17b3f"><strong>What is neck angioplasty?</strong></h2>

<p>Neck angioplasty is considered a minimally invasive procedure. It is done on patients who have narrowed or blocked arteries in the neck, especially the carotid arteries. These arteries are vital for supplying blood to the brain, and in Rakesh Roshan&rsquo;s case, it was around 75% blocked.</p>

<h2 id="68d62dae17b48"><strong>Why is neck angioplasty done?</strong></h2>

<p>The main purpose of getting a neck angioplasty is to prevent a stroke or mini-stroke caused by carotid artery stenosis. This is a condition where plaque narrows the arteries that supply blood to the brain. If the arteries are narrowed, then a blood clot can form at the site of the plaque, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.</p>

<h2 id="68d62dae17b4d"><strong>When is it recommended?</strong></h2>

<p>When the narrowing of your artery is 70 per cent or more, even without symptoms, you have had a transient ischemic attack or minor stroke, or have had a moderate narrowing of around 50-69 per cent. Also, it is recommended when you are at a high surgical risk and cannot undergo open surgery.</p>

<h2 id="68d62dae17b50"><strong>What lifestyle changes should be made? </strong></h2>

<p>Control your blood pressure by reducing your salt intake, exercising regularly, and taking any prescribed medications. High BP can damage artery walls and accelerate plaque buildup.</p>

<p>Keep your cholesterol level in control by getting regular blood tests. Eat more fibre, less saturated fats.</p>

<p>If you smoke, then you should instantly quit, as this damages blood vessels and speeds up plaque formation. You will notice that within a year of quitting, your risk of stroke will drop significantly.</p>

<p>If you are diabetic, then you should keep your sugar levels in control. Diabetes increases the risk of artery damage. You should limit your intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates, and take insulin or oral medications as prescribed.</p>

<p>As per reports in The Times of India, the wedding of Vignesh Krishnaswamy and Ananya Sawant took place in Pune on July 5, 2023. The ceremonies spanned over a total of 3 days, featuring mixed rituals from both Tamil and Maharashtrian culture.</p>

<p>The festivities included a Mehndi, Sangeet and Haldi ceremony along with lively music, dance and lavish feasts including traditional food from both regions. The groom looked dapper in a proper Tamil attire in white silk, while the bride stunned in a Pink silk saree. Their ceremonies were nothing less than an emotional roller coaster for both families.</p>

<p>While the Coldplay kiss cam moment may have seemed like light entertainment for concertgoers, the consequences for everyone involved are likely very real. Byron and Cabot both have families, and internet sleuths wasted no time connecting the dots.</p>

<p>The fan who posted the original clip captioned it &ldquo;trouble in paradise??&rdquo; and trouble may be putting it mildly. As more angles of the awkward encounter surfaced online, public speculation only increased. For everyone watching, it&rsquo;s a reminder: what&rsquo;s done in the dark can end up on the jumbotron, and then on over 50 million screens.</p>

His living room is a fusion between modernity and tradition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From having a corner dedicated to his planters to a special table for two, the room has it all. He has lovingly stored all the pillows, letters, and collage photo frames his fans have gifted him after the Bigg Boss win. Karan revealed that these gifts work as mood boosters when he feels down.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room, he keeps a mini wine fridge. He has an enviable collection of old DVDs. He is an art connoisseur and has collected beautiful paintings from different parts of the world. The big screens of the Bigg Boss set inspired him to install a big window that faces lush greenery and the splendid Mumbai skyline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His dining area is small and soulful. This section houses a dining table, photo frames, drawers, wine holders, and his beloved trophies. He escorts us to his office, where he reads or works on his scripts. The big attraction of this room is his collection of trendy caps. He is a fan of indoor sports and has kept a carrom board as a wall decor. He takes off his sandals as he shows us the shrine of his lost family members and all the holy scriptures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the other rooms, his bedroom is minimal in terms of furnishing. He proudly shows us his elaborate collection of branded and rare perfumes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karan has called this place home for the past 15 years. He mentions that he has tried to keep it the same over the years.

He is one of the most popular faces of Indian television, who will be seen in the mega-budget film <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/inside-ramayanas-wrap-up-party-ft-ranbir-kapoor-ravi-dubeys-warm-hug-cake-cutting-and-more-1392629">Ramayana</a> and has a charming personality that is loved by many. He has starred in commercially hit movies and TV shows and has established himself as a versatile actor. However, it wasn&rsquo;t always the case. Born into an affluent Hindu family, Ravi, who was initially pursuing engineering, reportedly lost all hope after failing his exams. Frustrated with the rat race, he started following Nichiren Buddhism, a Japanese Buddhist tradition, which provided him with much-needed &ldquo;understanding of the chaos that was going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Buddhism saved Ravi actor Dubey from losing himself&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Buddhism is made up of different sects and subsects, and different traditions are practiced in different countries. Nichiren Buddhism, which comes from Japan, focuses on the Lotus sutra. It doesn&rsquo;t discriminate and believes that anyone can achieve enlightenment. It focuses on empowering an individual and asks them to look within to attain enlightenment. Finding Buddhism became a defining moment in Ravi&rsquo;s life. Its teachings helped him to calm his mind, &nbsp;take a leap of faith, and inspired him not to lose hope even when faced with adversities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During a chat with Telly Chakkar, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/cinema/who-is-ravi-dubey-engineer-turned-actor-playing-laxman-in-ranbir-kapoors-ramayana-1392704">Ravi Dubey</a> stated, &quot;I started following it when I was going through a very rough patch in my life and I wanted some understanding of the chaos that was going on in one&#39;s life. I wanted to align myself and feel better about myself. So, when things went out of control, I started chanting at that time.&quot; He practices chanting &ldquo;Nam Myoho Renge Kyo,&rdquo; the primary mantra of Nichiren Buddhism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ravi reveals that Buddhism taught him to believe in the power of manifestation and cosmic power. Buddhist philosophy has changed his perspective for the better and he cherishes his life and those around him.&nbsp;</p>

Astro-Numerologist REVEALS]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-06/723205508_anushka-sharma-virat-kohli-love-relationship.webp"></img><p>Kohli&rsquo;s spiritual awakening has been closely tied to his life with Anushka Sharma. Spirituality has a huge impact on one&rsquo;s relationship. Astrologer Prashant Kapoor states that a belief in spirituality comes through a continued expression of care, concern, and mutual respect. In the case of Virat Kohli, he was someone who did not appear to be a spiritual person. He never believed in &lsquo;pooja-paath&rsquo;. As time evolved, the cricketer found his soulmate, and their love soared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The soulful love between the couple reflects through their way of respecting each other. When you respect the other person, you tend to listen to them. And then spirituality comes into the picture, he stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Astro-numerologist Prashant, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/throwback-video-virat-kohli-and-anushka-sharmas-epic-2017-wedding-reception-dance-off-1392313">Virat is deeply in love with Anushka</a>, and that intensity makes him believe that whatever his partner says or does is right. Nonetheless, Virat has truly transformed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Virat never fondly worshipped or believed in God. But today, he believes in his love. That belief seizes the first spot, and then comes the belief in spirituality. Virat visited Premanand Maharaj&rsquo;s ashram, Kaal Bhairav temple, and Neem Karoli Baba&rsquo;s ashram not because of a sudden connection to the spiritual world, but out of respect for his wife.</p>

<p>From the&nbsp;young cricketer who wore his emotions on his sleeves, he now strives to be a more composed and calm person. Though fiercely private about their family and often trying to shield their children, Vamika and Akaay, from the public eye, the couple has made spiritual travel a consistent part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>

He has helped many business tycoons and celebrities advance their careers. However, he is careful about interpreting personalized predictions&nbsp;and refrains from revealing the names of the shares to avoid issues with SEBI. Kapoor revealed&nbsp;that astrology can predict whether one should make long-term expenditures and invest in swing trading, or buy shares.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The astro-guru discussed&nbsp;one common mistake people make when buying shares, which is that when people see someone making a huge profit from a particular investment, they get heavily influenced. But it often proves to be a terrible mistake. Some get rich overnight by investing in the stock market, while some end up losing everything. What works for someone might not work for others, as it is decided by the fifth house of a person&rsquo;s natal chart. The fifth house, which is related to the stock market and karma from past lives, determines if a person will achieve a financial return. Furthermore, it has to be interconnected to the eighth house, which represents hidden assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Prashant, if Venus and Mercury are strong in someone&rsquo;s birth chart, they will make big bucks from the stock market. He believes that banking stocks might see a temporary recession in the coming months, but they will recover in no time. He suggests investing in good electronics, food, aerospace, defense, chemical, and shipping companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took Prashant Kapoor 10 years to master financial predictions. He recalls helping some <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/relationships/meet-indian-born-businessman-who-was-forced-to-sell-his-rs-12478-crore-company-for-rs-74-1392239">business</a> magnates make a fortune and hit the jackpot with his predictions. He has to keep a lot of aspects in mind while offering his financial insights. Apart from calculating the influence of the fifth house, he has to decipher their lunar mansions or nakshatra too. They&nbsp;are correlated with constellations and influence&nbsp;a person&rsquo;s turning points in life and karmic patterns, and he has to purify them if necessary. He also keeps the person&rsquo;s psychological condition in mind to see if they are competent to handle the loss.&nbsp;</p>

The world of business sees rich men losing their glory in the blink of an eye all the time. However, the &quot;rags to riches&quot; story of the Indian-born businessman B.R. Shetty is rather a sad one. He once inspired entrepreneurs across the globe to chase their dreams and secured the spot of one of the wealthiest magnates in the world. But sadly, the man who once boasted an ultra-high net worth of over Rs. 20,000 Cr&nbsp;was left with nothing after making an unconsidered decision that caused irreversible damage to his name and assets.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Brief Look at B. R. Shetty&rsquo;s&nbsp;Power and&nbsp;Loss of Status&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty was born in Udupi, Karnataka, India in 1942. He moved to the UAE when he was 31, reportedly with only a few dollars in his pocket. Shetty worked diligently to establish himself as the country&#39;s first medical representative. But he knew he did not want to settle for being a salesman. Several issues in the healthcare industry, including accessibility and cost, prompted the business mogul to embark on an entrepreneurial path, and he founded New Medical Centre Health in 1975. His journey was just getting started.</p>

<p>Under his leadership, NMC became the first private healthcare provider in the country and successfully entered the global market. As the company became an integral part of the London Stock Exchange and the FTSE 100 Exchange, B. R. Shetty never had to look back. It wasn&#39;t long before he acquired the ownership of UAE Exchange and Travelex. He was well-acquainted with prominent figures like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and even had plans to invest USD 5 billion for the betterment of the healthcare infrastructure in India. He is the proud owner of several successful business ventures, including Neopharma, BRS Ventures, and Finablr, according to reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>B.R.Shetty was once listed among Forbes&rsquo; list of the richest men of India and lived in the lap of luxury. In 2019, his net worth reached USD 3 billion. He owned two floors in Burj Khalifa, and the Rolls-Royce collection was enough to evoke envy. So, where did it go wrong?</p>

<p>Things started to go downhill when Muddy Waters Research, a USA-based investment firm, brought some serious allegations against him. Allegedly, Shetty&rsquo;s firm had a USD 1 billion debt, which he kept hidden from the investors. He soon had to give up his place on the NMC Health Board, and the company went under UK administration. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank also filed a complaint against NMC and the Central Bank of UAE ordered a restraint on all his bank accounts and his firms were blacklisted, an investigation is ongoing against the business tycoon in India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>B. R. Shetty is no longer a part of Forbes&#39; billionaire list since 2020. Although he is nowhere near being poor, his current wealth doesn&rsquo;t hold a candle in front of his pre-2019 net worth. The accusations against him resulted in a price drop in shares, and he sold the business for Rs 74 to an Israel-UAE consortium.&nbsp;Shetty&rsquo;s rise and fall from grace almost imitate a tragic film. He was at the top once, but his fate played cruel tricks on him, and he lost everything almost overnight.&nbsp;</p>

Sea-Facing Bandra Home</strong></p>

<p>Aamir Khan&rsquo;s primary residence is located in an elite Virgo Co-operative Housing Society in Bandra, Mumbai. The 5000 sq. ft. home costing around Rs. 60 crore spreads across two floors. His home offers panoramic views of the Arabian Sea. One of the floors of the duplex is more of a workspace, representing his passion for movies. The open spaces, muted tones, and picturesque setting of the house are the perfect blend of elegance and luxury.</p>

<p><strong>2. Panchgani Farmhouse</strong></p>

<p>The Rang De Basanti actor&rsquo;s Rs. 7 crore Panchgani house is a rustic refuge. His farmhouse, located in Panchgani, a hill station in Maharashtra, is perched on a two-acre plot. Reportedly, he paid Rs 42 as stamp duty for the property. The farmhouse keeps the actor and his family away from showbiz glam, offering solace. The property&rsquo;s mossy verandas, misty mornings, and a tranquil atmosphere make it the Khan&rsquo;s preferred spot for hosting intimate parties and for philosophical unwinding.</p>

<p><strong>3. Beverly Hills, California Mansion</strong></p>

<p>The<em> </em>Lagaan alum made a significant investment in Beverly Hills, California, by purchasing a luxurious property worth Rs 75 crore in the wealthiest area.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not all, the actor owns two plush flats in Marina apartments, one high-end flat in Bella Vista, Pali Hill, four commercial properties worth Rs 35 crore in Santacruz, and nine properties in the Virgo Co-op Society alone.</p>

<h2 id="68d6320e08bb8">Talking about his automobile collection, there are many notable vehicles on the list.</h2>

<p><strong>Rolls-Royce Ghost</strong></p>

<p>In the Khan&rsquo;s garage, this&nbsp;is one of the most elite rides. The cost of the car falls within the range of Rs. 5.25 crore to Rs. 7.95 crore. It features British finesse with royal undertones.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mercedes-Benz S600 Guard</strong></p>

<p>Another addition to Aamir&#39;s collection of expensive belongings is a Mercedes-Benz S600 Guard. It is yet another exquisite piece, typically owned by Presidents and Popes. The price of this expensive armored vehicle is around Rs 10.50 crore.</p>

<p><strong>Bentley Continental Flying Spur</strong></p>

<p>The actor owns a Bentley Continental Flying Spur with a special &lsquo;007&rsquo; number plate. It is priced between Rs 6.95 lakh and Rs 7.95 crore.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Range Rover Vogue</strong></p>

<p>The Ghajni<em> </em>actor prefers &ldquo;quiet cars,&rdquo; and the Range Rover Vogue is among his favorites. For him, it is not about horsepower; it&rsquo;s about soul power. It is a perfectly designed go-anywhere and conquer-any-road SUV. The price ranges from Rs. 2.31 crore to Rs. 3.41 crore.</p>

In 1970, he was quite capable of settling overseas, but one letter from his father got him back to his roots.</p>

<p>In 1979, the death of a patient in India, due to a lack of medical facilities, left a lasting impact on Dr. Reddy.

He attended Harvard University but had to leave during his sophomore year to focus on his startup project. He launched Facebook as a joint venture with his roommates in 2004. However, miscommunications happened, and he had to face countless hurdles to take his tech company to new heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mark met his wife, Priscilla, while attending university, and the couple tied the knot in 2012. Last year, his wealth jumped by USD 78 billion. According to Forbes, Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s current net worth is estimated at USD 235.7 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His daily routine is quite similar to that of any other 9-to-5 employee. He has incorporated the necessary lifestyle changes to power through a hectic day. After getting up at 8 in the morning, the first thing he does is check Facebook to get updates on world news. He gets &ldquo;punched in the stomach&rdquo; with the inundation of texts from his connections. He then heads straight to the gym.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zuckerberg works out at least three times a week to &ldquo;reset&rdquo; himself. In the past, he focused on running, but recently, he has shifted his focus to jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA). Over the years, he has developed several hobbies, including surfing, raising cattle, learning Mandarin, and reading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 40-year-old tech mogul is pretty transparent about his lifestyle choices. From eliminating time-consuming habits like planning his outfits every day to incorporating various forms of martial arts into his fitness regimen, he is setting an example as one of the most inspiring <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/home-decor/meet-leena-tewari-who-bought-rs-703-crore-duplex-in-mumbais-worli-who-is-this-billionaire-and-whats-her-story-1391399">CEOs</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite encountering a turbulent journey, one thing that has stayed consistent throughout the years is his humble nature and dedication toward leading a healthy and unostentatious lifestyle. And this has made him one of the top 10 richest men in the world.&nbsp;</p>

Drawing an example from a past interview where she was even scared to look at the camera, she emphasized that Priyanka has come a long way. She lauded Peecee by calling her a &ldquo;people&rsquo;s person,&rdquo; who listens carefully to what the other person has to say before answering. Priyanka is also not afraid to criticize herself and isn&rsquo;t scared to own the jokes people make about her, a quality that makes her invincibly confident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kanan feels that living with an American husband also played a part in transforming Priyanka&rsquo;s body language. Along with Chopra, Kanan presented her careful observation of several other high-profile celebrities, including Virat Kohli, Shah Rukh Khan, Narendra Modi, the Obamas, etc. She also gave viewers precious lifestyle and relationship advice. The episode has since garnered attention from curious fans across the nation.&nbsp;</p>

Leena Gandhi Tewari, the chairperson of pharma giant USV Pharmaceuticals, bought two luxurious, sea-facing duplex apartments in Worli, Mumbai. It is India&rsquo;s most exorbitant residential property transaction to date. Adding GST and stamp duty to the figure, the total cost of the apartment soared to Rs. 703 crore approximately.</p>

<p>The luxurious duplex apartment located in the sky-high Naman Xana Tower offers stunning views of the expansive Arabian Sea and breathtaking sunsets. She purchased the high-end apartments on May 28, 2025, and since then, Leena has created a buzz.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Leena Tewari&rsquo;s Rs. 703 Cr Luxury Duplex is from the 32nd to 35th floors with</strong>&nbsp;<strong>over 22,572 sq. ft</strong></p>

<p>The lavish twin duplexes are nestled on the 32nd to 35th floors of Naman Xana. It is a newly constructed 40-story ultra-luxurious residential tower. With over 22,572 sq. ft. of carpet area, the apartments are worth over Rs 2.83 lakh per sq. ft. In India&rsquo;s residential market, this represents the highest recorded price per square foot.</p>

<p>For the property, Tewari paid Rs. 639 crore, and after adding stamp duty and GST, she invested a total amount of Rs. 703 crore. Due to its prime seafront location, the tower&#39;s sale price has established a new benchmark for luxury apartments throughout India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project is scheduled to be completed by 28 August 2027, with a starting price of Rs. 97.50 crore for residences. It offers high-end 6500 sq. ft. apartments, whereas, the facilities include a gym, a party hall, a Pilates room, and an indoor games area. The eco-friendly architecture, prime location, and smart home automation services make it one of the most coveted addresses in Mumbai.</p>

<p><strong>Leena Tewari&rsquo;s Net Worth</strong></p>

<p>According to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire 2025 List, Leena Gandhi Tewari&rsquo;s net worth is estimated to be around $3.9 billion, which is more than Rs. 32,500 crore. She has not only earned recognition as the Granddaughter of USV founder Vithal Balkrishna Gandhi but also as the chairperson of the prestigious Indian pharmaceutical and biotechnology firm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leena Tewari is not the only one who signed a great real estate deal. Banker Uday Kotak, too, sparked conversations after he bought an entire Worli sea-facing building for more than Rs. 400 crore. The deal consisted of apartments ranging at about Rs 2.90 lakh per sq. ft.</p>

<p>In April 2025, the chairperson of Godrej Properties, Pirojsha Adi Godrej, and his cousin, Freyan Crishna Bieri, purchased four apartments worth Rs &nbsp;290.59 crore parallel to Peddar Road. The apartments were part of the Carmichael project on Carmichael Road, Mumbai, sold for Rs 1.78 lakh per sq. ft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In May, reportedly, Tanya Dubash, the Executive Director and Chief Brand Officer of Godrej Industries, purchased a Rs. 226 crore-worth duplex through Shaula Real Estates, where he is also listed as a director. Covering a built-up area of 11,485 sq ft, this duplex, which spans the 30th and 31st floors, also features a 1,227 sq ft balcony and includes six parking lots.</p>

<p>All in all, the real estate industry has been experiencing unprecedented growth with properties valued at Rs. 2 crore and above. With Leena&rsquo;s&nbsp;purchase, the country has set the highest-ever property registration. It is also true that the soaring figures are largely due to the panoramic views of the sea and the extraordinary facilities. Nonetheless, Worli is emerging as the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/home-decor/inside-kim-kardashians-luxe-closet-where-boots-and-bags-get-vip-treatment-1390911">billionaire&rsquo;s home</a> where ultra-high-net-worth individuals seek luxury at its best.</p>

He was renowned for hosting some incredibly lavish parties back in the day, whether for personal celebrations or those of his companies.</p>

<p>The fugitive businessman hosted an unforgettable event in Goa for two days back in 2015. Well, Vijay had turned 60 and thrown one of the most luxurious galas ever, attended by the A-listers from across the globe.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Mallya&rsquo;s Goan birthday celebrations are worth more than 2 million USD</strong></p>

<p>In December 2015, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/food-travel/vijay-mallyas-14-expensive-car-collection-ferrari-was-auctioned-off-and-is-now-owned-by-1390784">Vijay Mallya</a> invited distinguished guests, artists, performers, close friends, and family to his beachfront property, Kingfisher Villa in Goa, as he hosted a grand 60th birthday celebration.</p>

<p>The extravaganza, according to a Forbes report, lasted for a full two days and cost the fugitive businessman more than USD 2 million. It was attended by more than 200 people in all.</p>

<p><strong>Lavish arrangements were made for guests</strong></p>

<p>While the celebrations for Vijay Mallya&rsquo;s birthday did take place at his villa, he was also accompanied by his son Siddhartha, who had just quit his own business and joined his dad Mallya.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining guests, dignitaries, and other invitees were comfortably accommodated at the neighbouring Taj Hotel.</p>

<p><strong>Fireworks, concerts by Sonu Nigam and Enrique Iglesias</strong></p>

<p>Besides the incredibly luxurious arrangements that were made for everyone at the party, the guests and the hosts were also treated to some fantastic fireworks shows, specifically arranged for the former business tycoon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreover, notable Spanish pop artist Enrique Iglesias and Bollywood playback singer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-sonu-nigam-and-arijit-singh-come-together-for-sandese-aate-hai-2-0-border-2-gets-even-bigger-1386634">Sonu Nigam</a> were also invited to hold private concerts at the celebration.</p>

<p>Mallya had later revealed that the Ishk Vishk singer did not take any fees to host a private concert on his 60th birthday.</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Mallya was supposedly advised to cut down on hosting extravaganzas on his birthday</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, at the time when Vijay Mallya hosted such a grand affair for his birthday, he had just been declared bankrupt, and his company, Kingfisher Airlines, had completely shut down.</p>

<p>According to reports, the fugitive businessman was advised to steer clear of hosting a gala of such a large scale and instead host a small and intimate celebration in London, where he owns a country estate.</p>

<p>However, Vijay remained steadfast on actually &lsquo;living a good life&rsquo; and ended up earning more redressal from not only his former company management but also from the then-governor of the RBI, Raghuram Rajan.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vijay Mallya claimed public anger fueled after his 60th birthday bash</strong></p>

<p>In one of his recent interviews on Raj Shamani&rsquo;s podcast, the fugitive businessman looked back on the public outrage that was amplified after news of his lavish 60th birthday bash broke out.</p>

<p>He remarked that there were ample misconceptions about his alleged lavish lifestyle and overseas investments.</p>

<p>Explaining his sincere perspective, he apologized for the failure of his airline. He even revealed how four of his settlement offers to banks were mercilessly turned down.</p>

<p>Vijay said, &ldquo;I apologise publicly for the failure of the airline. &ldquo;I made four settlement offers to the banks. None were accepted.&rdquo;</p>

Aptly called &ldquo;The Sweetest Scene in Your City,&rdquo; the event brought together baking talent, dessert lovers, and some serious sugar-fueled fun. With over 2 Mn cakes delivered annually and a stronghold in the category, IGP continues to shape how India celebrates with cake, making this fest a natural extension of its leadership in the space.</p>

<p>At the heart of the fest was the highly anticipated &ldquo;Battle of the Bakers&rdquo;, where top home bakers competed for the ₹1 Lakh grand prize and the chance to feature their winning cake on igp&rsquo;s online platform with 5 million users. After an intense and mouthwatering showcase of skill and creativity, the event saw a wide range of innovative and visually stunning cakes, making it a tough call for the judging panel to choose just one winner.</p>

<p>Among 40 shortlisted participants, Trashika Dsena emerged as the standout baker, taking home the title and a sweet reward to match. The audience also had their say, voting live at the venue for the Popular Choice Award, which was won by Jill Shah.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Celebrity chef Natasha Gandhi, known for her appearance on MasterChef India, presided over the judging panel and shared valuable feedback with the finalists. Comedian Shreeja Chaturvedi had the crowd in splits with a live stand-up set, adding just the right dash of humor to balance the sugar rush.<br />
Visitors indulged in dessert tastings, interactive photo ops, fun zones, and exclusive giveaways, making it a true playground for the sweet-toothed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The response was overwhelming,&rdquo; said Tarun Joshi, Founder &amp; CEO of IGP. &ldquo;Our aim was to spotlight India&rsquo;s growing baking culture and build a real community around it and IGP Cake Fest turned out to be the perfect platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;IGP Cake Fest wasn&rsquo;t just about cakes, it was about connection, celebration, and community. And judging by the turnout and smiles, Mumbai was more than ready for it.&rdquo; Natasha Gandhi, a celebrity chef, further added.</p>

<p>With an unforgettable mix of talent, taste, and togetherness, IGP Cake Fest wasn&rsquo;t just a celebration of baking, it was a celebration of community.

She is seen curiously asking about the recipes and trying to learn them firsthand. She mentions how important food is to her and how her caretakers pay attention to whether or not she is eating on time and eating healthily. The chia pudding is an energy booster, requires very little time, and is a staple in her diet. Alia mentions having developed a sweet tooth, and the pudding is the perfect solution to her sudden sweet cravings. Alia often has it in the morning for breakfast or as a snack. Let&rsquo;s see how it is prepared:</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>1 scoop chia seeds (roasted) &nbsp;<br />
1 cup coconut milk<br />
1 scoop protein powder<br />
&frac14; teaspoon stevia as a sweetener</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong></p>

<p>In a bowl, take a scoop of chia seeds and soak them in coconut milk.&nbsp;Add protein powder to the mixture. Alia uses Isopure. Now add stevia or any sweetener of your choice. Combine all the ingredients. Gently beat the mixture with a spoon so no lumps can be formed. Refrigerate until cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can garnish the pudding with fruits (like berries) and nuts. It is a perfectly balanced breakfast option that ticks all the essentials of the food chart. Chia seeds come with a variety of benefits, including supporting bone health, cardiovascular health, and digestion, and they also aid in weight loss. Alia&rsquo;s profession demands that she follow a well-rounded and clean diet. Instead of completely cutting off her favorite dishes, she embraces mindful eating and makes everyday meals more wholesome and nutrient-dense. Her quick and delicious chia pudding recipe caught the netizens&rsquo; attention and became an instant hit, with many trying to recreate it with their own twist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 32-year-old launched her YouTube channel back in 2019, where she uploads vlogs with snippets from her everyday life. Her channel currently boasts over 25 lakh subscribers. She uploads recipes, workout videos, movie tours, Q&amp;A sessions, etc. The videos give her fans a glimpse of her everyday life and a chance to connect with their favorite actress on a deeper level, who is just as chatty and bubbly off camera as she is on screen.</p>

<p>Bipasha and Karan first met in 2014 while filming Alone and tied the knot two years later in 2016.

Whether you&#39;re a casual sipper or a full-blown tea enthusiast, there&rsquo;s no better way to honor the day than by brewing a cup with a twist. And who better to take inspiration from than actor Pankaj Tripathi, who revealed his personal masala chai recipe in a chat with content creator Prajakta Koli?</p>

<p>In an&nbsp;interview on Netflix&rsquo;s Mostly Sane, Pankaj Tripathi opened up about his love for making tea himself and shared what makes his version so &ldquo;special.&rdquo; Known for his grounded personality and unmatched screen presence in films like Stree 2, the actor gave fans a peek into his kitchen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What makes it special? It&rsquo;s his secret ingredient: bay leaf. Yes, you read that right. He proudly said, &ldquo;Humari chai, khaas chai hai. Masala chai bolke hotel mein kya milta hai mujhe nahi malum. Toh mai apni masala chai jaisa banata hu waisa banaunga. (My tea is special. I don&#39;t know what hotels mean by masala tea. So I prepare masala tea my way).&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even Prajakta was surprised at this ingredient choice and asked, &ldquo;Tej patta bhi daalte hai? Maine pehli kabhi tej patte wali chai nahi pi hai. (You add bay leaves too? I&rsquo;ve never had bay leaf tea before).&quot;&nbsp;To this, Pankaj confirmed it tastes really good.</p>

<p><strong>Pankaj Tripathi&rsquo;s masala chai recipe</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>2 cups water</p>

<p>1 cup milk</p>

<p>2 tsp black tea leaves</p>

<p>2 cloves</p>

<p>2 green cardamom pods (crushed)</p>

<p>1-inch piece fresh ginger (grated)</p>

<p>1 small bay leaf</p>

<p>Sugar to taste</p>

<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>

<p>Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepan.</p>

<p>Add cloves, crushed cardamom, grated ginger, and the bay leaf.</p>

<p>Let the spices simmer for 2-3 minutes to release their flavors.</p>

<p>Add black tea leaves and steep for 1-2 minutes, based on your strength preference.</p>

<p>Pour in the milk and increase the heat to bring the mixture to a gentle boil.</p>

<p>Stir in sugar to taste and simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</p>

<p>Strain and serve hot.</p>

<p>Pankaj Tripathi&rsquo;s heartfelt approach to tea-making reminds us that simple pleasures can be deeply personal. Turns out, Pankaj Tripathi isn&rsquo;t the only celebrity who loves tea.</p>

<p>Alia Bhatt once shared a picture of her enjoying chai on a rainy day, calling it the perfect companion. Shraddha Kapoor has often mentioned how tea helps her unwind, especially during monsoon. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-yami-gautam-and-vikrant-masseys-rom-com-ginny-weds-sunny-2-to-go-on-floors-soon-makers-begin-pre-production-1378572">Yami Gautam</a>, who hails from Himachal Pradesh, is also a tea lover and has shared her fondness for pahadi chai. Meanwhile, Malaika Arora, known for her wellness routines, often enjoys her evening chai with healthy snacks.</p>

Mundota Fort and Palace</strong></p>

<p>Just outside Jaipur in the Aravalli Hills, this 450-year-old fortress is a hidden gem. Its hilltop vistas, jharokha windows, and grand archways are used in several scenes depicting private family moments and introspective dialogues. Viewers can even book a stay here for a taste of royal luxury.</p>

<p><strong>3. Samode Palace</strong></p>

<p>Romantic and rich in character, the 475-year-old Samode Palace is tucked in a valley near Jaipur. Its hand-painted frescoes, mirror work, and serene courtyards lend themselves to some of the show&rsquo;s more intimate and emotional scenes&mdash;perfect for secret rendezvous and heartfelt revelations.</p>

<p><strong>4. Shiv Vilas Resort, Jaipur</strong></p>

<p>On the more theatrical end, Shiv Vilas Resort brings grandeur to a whole new level with its white domes, gold detailing, and massive chandeliers. The resort&#39;s flamboyant interiors add a dose of fantasy to the show&#39;s dramatic arcs, making it the ideal setting for high-stakes confrontations and royal festivities.</p>

<p><strong>5. Alila Fort, Bishangarh</strong></p>

<p>This 230-year-old warrior fort turned luxury retreat offers a darker, moodier vibe. Used in the show for more intense and grounded sequences, the fort&rsquo;s narrow windows, stone corridors, and desert views add dramatic tension and a sense of isolation.</p>

<p>The locations in The Royals aren&rsquo;t just visually stunning; they reflect the emotional tone of each scene. Whether it&rsquo;s a whisper of romance in a candlelit corridor or a moment of reckoning in a sunlit courtyard, each frame is enhanced by its real-world setting. And the best part is that most of these places are open to visitors, allowing fans to walk through the same regal hallways that brought this fictional drama to life.</p>

From grand palaces to picturesque desert backdrops, celebrities often choose Rajasthan as the canvas for their dream nuptials. Known for its regal charm, warm hospitality, and cultural richness, the state has become a top favorite for Bollywood stars tying the knot. Whether it&rsquo;s the majestic forts or the timeless romance in the air, Rajasthan continues to win hearts as the ultimate wedding destination. Here&#39;s how five Bollywood couples proved why Rajasthan is perfect for a big, fat royal wedding.</p>

<p><strong>1. Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif&mdash;For Secrecy and Luxury Combined</strong></p>

<p>The world was buzzing with excitement when <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-buzz-kartik-aaryan-or-vicky-kaushal-to-spearhead-amaran-director-rajkumar-periasamys-hindi-debut-1385966">Vicky Kaushal </a>and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/throwback-when-katrina-kaif-talked-about-her-idea-of-ideal-parenting-for-her-children-when-i-have-kids-1358778">Katrina Kaif</a> decided to get married in December 2021. Their wedding took place in Sawai Madhopur at a 700-year-old fort turned luxury resort. What made their wedding stand out was not just the opulence but the level of privacy they were able to maintain. Rajasthan&rsquo;s remote yet lavish venues offer both exclusivity and luxury, perfect for celebrities who want a private yet stunning wedding. Their nuptials proved that in Rajasthan, grandeur doesn&rsquo;t have to come at the cost of privacy.</p>

<p><strong>2. Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas&mdash;For Blending Cultures in a Royal Setting</strong></p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas-daughter-malti-marie-hosts-cutest-tea-party-and-we-bet-youd-regret-not-being-part-of-it-pics-1388268">Priyanka Chopra</a> and Nick Jonas got married at Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, they brought together two worlds&mdash;Indian and American&mdash;in the most royal way possible. The palace, one of the last great palaces built in India, offered the perfect blend of heritage and hospitality. From traditional Hindu ceremonies to a white wedding, everything looked straight out of a dream. The cultural mix, vibrant colors, and regal location turned their wedding into a global celebration. Rajasthan&rsquo;s majestic settings allowed them to honor both cultures in grand style.</p>

<p><strong>3. Raveena Tandon and Anil Thadani&mdash;For a Heritage Affair</strong></p>

<p>Back in 2004, when destination weddings weren&rsquo;t even that common, Raveena Tandon chose Jag Mandir Palace in Udaipur to marry film distributor Anil Thadani. Surrounded by Lake Pichola, the palace looked like a floating dream. The couple&#39;s wedding was a classic example of how Rajasthan&rsquo;s rich history and palatial architecture add a sense of timelessness to every ceremony. The state&#39;s heritage venues make every moment picture-perfect&mdash;no fancy filters needed.</p>

<p><strong>4. Neil Nitin Mukesh and Rukmini Sahay&mdash;For Family-Friendly Grandeur</strong></p>

<p>In 2017, Neil Nitin Mukesh married Rukmini Sahay at a luxury resort and spa in Udaipur. What stood out about their wedding was how family-focused and culturally rooted it was, yet celebrated in grandeur. Rajasthan&rsquo;s accessibility, luxury, and large-scale venue options make it easy to accommodate extended families and guests. Plus, the traditional feel of the region helps make ceremonies more connected to Indian customs. The balance of tradition and luxury made their wedding one to remember.</p>

<p><strong>5. Shriya Saran and Andrei Koscheev&mdash;For a Magical Vibe</strong></p>

<p>Though Shriya Saran and her Russian entrepreneur husband, Andrei Koscheev, had a quiet ceremony in Mumbai, they celebrated their wedding later in Rajasthan. They hosted a dreamy post-wedding bash in Udaipur, filled with traditional Indian d&eacute;cor, folk music, and candle-lit views of the lake. Their celebration showed that even post-wedding events become magical when held in Rajasthan. It&rsquo;s not just a place for the main event&mdash;it&rsquo;s a destination for memories that linger long after the vows are exchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Why is Rajasthan a celeb-favorite wedding destination?</strong></p>

<p>Bollywood couples aren&rsquo;t just picking Rajasthan for its beauty. The state offers a complete wedding experience:</p>

<p><strong>Architectural Grandeur:</strong> From centuries-old forts to luxury palaces, the venues feel right out of a movie set.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Depth:</strong> Local traditions, music, and food add rich layers to every event.</p>

<p><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Known for royal treatment, Rajasthan offers world-class services and warm welcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy &amp; Security:</strong> Many venues are remote or exclusively booked, making them ideal for high-profile events.</p>

<p><strong>Diverse Backdrops:</strong> Be it lakes, deserts, palaces, or gardens&mdash;every location is stunning.</p>

<p>Bollywood stars have shown that when it comes to celebrating love, Rajasthan never disappoints.&nbsp;</p>

Among those who embraced this trend was popular actress Samantha Ruth Prabhu, who not only shared her favorite recipes online but also promoted healthy eating habits.</p>

<p>In one of her collaborations with Upasana Kamineni Konidela, entrepreneur and wife of actor Ram Charan, Samantha appeared on Upasana&#39;s YouTube channel UR Life. She introduced a wholesome twist to a traditional South Indian favorite &mdash; idlis.</p>

<p>Instead of using the usual rice batter, Samantha revealed a vegan and healthier version of idlis made with oats and carrots. This easy and quick recipe became an instant hit with fans for being nutritious, delicious, and ideal for breakfast. If you&#39;re someone who&#39;s always in a hurry but doesn&#39;t want to compromise on eating clean and healthy, this recipe could be the perfect fit for your mornings.</p>

<p>Samantha has called this her go-to breakfast recipe, especially since she follows a vegan lifestyle and prefers light, nourishing meals to start her day.</p>

<p>Samantha&#39;s oats carrot idli combines the goodness of fiber-rich oats and beta-carotene-packed carrots, offering a filling yet low-calorie option. This version of idlis is not only vegan but also uses ingredients that are easily available and budget-friendly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/south/throwback-when-upasana-konidela-could-not-stop-praising-jr-ntrs-wife-lakshmi-pranathi-tarak-is-very-lucky-1388480">Upasana</a>, after tasting the dish, admitted that it was so delicious she wouldn&#39;t mind cooking it daily. Her positive reaction added to the charm of the video, and many fans found the duo&#39;s chemistry and friendly banter both enjoyable and inspiring.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p>While the recipe sticks to its healthy roots, the ingredients differ slightly from traditional idlis, with no fermentation or long waiting time. Here&#39;s a basic outline of what goes into it. Note that exact quantities can be adjusted to suit personal preference:</p>

<p>Oat flour or powdered oats</p>

<p>Semolina (rava)</p>

<p>Grated carrot</p>

<p>Mustard seeds</p>

<p>Cumin seeds</p>

<p>Chana dal and urad dal (a small amount for crunch)</p>

<p>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</p>

<p>Green chili (finely chopped, for mild spice)</p>

<p>Curry leaves and coriander leaves</p>

<p>Salt to taste</p>

<p>Cooking oil</p>

<p>Water</p>

<p><strong>How To Prepare Samantha&#39;s Oats Carrot Idlis</strong></p>

<p>1. The steps are simple, and you don&#39;t need to spend hours in the kitchen. Here&#39;s how you can make this healthy dish:</p>

<p>2. Start by heating oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, urad dal, chana dal, curry leaves, and green chili. Let everything sizzle for a bit.</p>

<p>3. Add semolina (rava) and stir it well with the tempering. Cook for a couple of minutes, making sure nothing burns.</p>

<p>4. Next, mix in the grated carrot and let it cook slightly so it softens a bit.</p>

<p>5. Now add the oat flour along with salt and give everything a good mix. Stir the dry mixture until it releases a slightly nutty aroma.</p>

<p>6. Remove from the heat and transfer the mixture to a bowl. Add water slowly, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Let this batter rest for about 15-20 minutes.</p>

<p>7. Grease idli moulds with a bit of oil and pour in the batter. Steam the idlis for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are firm and cooked through.</p>

<p>Once they&#39;re done, serve these soft and fluffy idlis with coconut chutney, sambar, or even a mint dip of your choice. They make for a light yet filling breakfast and are perfect for anyone looking to eat clean without compromising flavor.</p>

<p>Though the home isn&rsquo;t huge, every corner is thoughtfully designed. The kitchen is small but fully equipped. It features baby blue shelves and white countertops that add a playful charm. This is where Ananya has discovered her love for baking and spending time preparing meals.</p>

<p>The dining area is another favorite spot for hosting guests. A large window brings in daylight and offers a view of leafy Bandra lanes, keeping the area bright and cheerful.</p>

<p><strong>Personal and Practical</strong></p>

<p>The walk-in closet, with pink walls and smart storage, reflects the kind of dreamy space most girls think about while growing up. The bedroom also follows the soft, clean style of the rest of the house, with calming tones and personal touches.</p>

<p>While decorating her home, Ananya wanted the space to feel like an extension of her own personality. And that&rsquo;s exactly what this house feels like &mdash; personal, peaceful, and pretty.</p>

<p><strong>Gauri Khan&#39;s Signature Touch</strong></p>

<p>Gauri Khan&rsquo;s design philosophy is clear here &mdash; make the most of the space, keep things stylish but livable, and always bring in light. Her use of mirrors, large windows, custom furniture, and muted tones works well to create a calm but expressive space.</p>

<p>More than just an apartment, this home marks a turning point in Ananya Panday&rsquo;s life. It&rsquo;s a symbol of growing up, making choices, and finding joy in the little things, like buying her own cutlery or baking cookies. And in true Bollywood style, her first home is designed by none other than Gauri Khan, making it all the more special.</p>

This place remains the top quintessential retreat for so many reasons. Whether you wish to escape the hustle and bustle of the city or need an adventurous escapade, the Dil Chahta Hai land has something to offer to every kind of traveler.</p>

<p>Mira Rajut visited Goa with her gang and had the best time, relishing in cultural food, trekking, and relaxing in the forest. Her one-day or weekend itinerary is perfect for a quick but fulfilling trip. Let&rsquo;s explore the Mira Rajput-approved itinerary for a fun weekend in Goa:</p>

<p><strong>Konkani Thali&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Konkan region stretches from Maharashtra, Goa, and Karnataka, so the concept of a Konkani thali slightly changes region to region. However, if in Goa, you see places called Khanaval (Home kitchen) and they&rsquo;re anything but a fancy restaurant. There are shaky iron tables and red plastic chairs, you&rsquo;d know you have to come to a place that serves authentic, home-made Konkani Thali.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As captured by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/mira-kapoor-mixes-laid-back-vibes-with-high-fashion-pairing-brown-off-shoulder-top-with-loewe-trousers-worth-rs-93k-1376173">Mira Rajput</a>, her thali of Konkani delight exuded comfort and coastal simplicity at its best. It has puffed up golden-brown puris, Kanda bhajiya&mdash;a spicy and crispy street food of the Konkan region, Batata bhaji&mdash;a comforting potato curry made with boiled potatoes. Other accompaniments included green chutney and tangy mango pickle, which, by the way, go perfectly with puris. The thali also had Patoli or Patoleo&mdash;a Konkan sweet made with rice flour paste, shredded coconut, and palm jaggery, wrapped and steamed in a banana leaf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mira Rajput&rsquo;s Konkani Thali was an epitome of cultural delight and soulful delicacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spend time in nature&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>While you can spend all the time you have on the beach, do not miss a serene stroll in the lush forest of Goa. The clear sky, coconut trees, and greenery stretching to far ends, a peaceful escapade in the Goa forest is equivalent to meditating. Especially, if you&rsquo;re looking to wear off all weekly stress and create a calm headspace, you&rsquo;d appreciate spending time in the susegad nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Visit a spice farm&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Amongst crazy parties and laidback afternoons at the retreat, lies an underrated activity which can amp up your experience in Goa. Shahid Kapoor&rsquo;s wife visited a spice farm and went coconuts with its unique experience. A spice farm will take you to the roots of Goa&rsquo;s culinary treasures&mdash;the spices. Strolling through these plantations, you&rsquo;d experience heady scents of cinnamon, dreamy aroma of vanilla, and more spices like cardamom and nutmeg. While you take a glimpse of these, a guide will probably take you on an educational trip, versing you about the cultivation and usage of these spices. When restful, take shelter on the soft grass, under lush green trees, through which the sunlight peeps, making you feel alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Trekking at Netravali waterfalls</strong></p>

<p>The way to Netravali waterfalls is through Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary, located in south-eastern Goa. Tucked secretly in a lush green forest, this waterfall offers adventure and tranquility both. The vivacious waterfall creates a striking contrast against the backdrop of dense forest and cascades into a serene lake. Locally known as Savari Falls, this natural location is great to spend a day of fun, excitement, and recreation. Rajput made her way through the clear waters of the lake, diving into its symphony and becoming one with the quiet and soul-soothing nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, the skincare maven summed up her Goa trip with her glimpse of taking a dive into the swimming pool, having the time of her life with her gang. The way Mira spent her short trip to Goa sets the perfect tone for a refreshing and rejuvenating escapade to the serene side of the party capital of India.&nbsp;</p>

While this has been a conscious choice made by them, it also means they need to fulfill their nutrient requirements from alternative sources.</p>

<p>Tofu has been one of the key ingredients in the diets of these celebs when it comes to their source of protein. Here are 5 delicious celeb-approved recipes with tofu, which are a good option for a light vegan meal.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Bhumi Pednekar&rsquo;s favourite Tofu tikki</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Firm tofu, isabgol, medium potato, onion, green chillies, ginger-garlic paste, cilantro, condiments</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong></p>

<p>First, prepare the tofu by draining excess water. Then crumble it inside a bowl. Add mashed potato, 2 tablespoons of isabgol, minced onion and green chilies, ginger-garlic paste along with cilantro and condiments (salt, pepper, and cumin powder).</p>

<p>Shape the mixture into small tikkis. Heat a little bit of oil in a pan and shallow-fry the tikkis until they turn golden on each side. Enjoy the tikkis with a side of mint chutney if you wish.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Shahid Kapoor&rsquo;s love for Tofu bhurji</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>200 gms of firm tofu, veggies (onion, tomato, green chillies, coriander leaves), oil of your choice, condiments (salt, pepper, cumin powder, garam masala, turmeric powder)</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong></p>

<p>Crumble the tofu into a mince-like texture like usual paneer bhurji and set it aside. Heat a bit of oil in a non-stick pan and add the veggies. Saut&eacute; it for a few minutes until the onion caramelizes. Add the spices one by one, except salt and pepper. Keep stirring so that the mixture doesn&rsquo;t get charred.</p>

<p>Add in the scrambled tofu to the pan at this point. Keep stirring to ensure the tofu absorbs all the flavors. Simmer it for a while after adding salt and pepper. Take off the heat, garnish with coriander and serve hot.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s easy-peasy stir-fried Tofu</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Tofu, sesame oil, cornstarch, sauces (soy, rice vinegar, sriracha), brown sugar, white sesame seeds, veggies (garlic cloves, bell peppers, spring onion)</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong></p>

<p>Make a cornstarch slurry and dip the diced tofu in it for coating. Shallow fry them in sesame oil and set aside. Pour a bit more oil in the same pan and then add all the veggies. Saut&eacute; for a few minutes. As it begins to simmer, add your sauces along with a bit of brown sugar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let it cook until the raw smell of condiments disappears. Add water and cornstarch to adjust the consistency of the mixture. Finally, add the tofu pieces and stir. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Manisha Koirala&rsquo;s classic spicy Nepali keto Tofu</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Diced tofu, finely chopped ginger and garlic, veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, string beans, broccoli, bell pepper, spring onion), sesame oil, sauces (chilli bean, soy)</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong></p>

<p>Heat a pan and put in a little bit of sesame oil. Add chopped ginger and garlic along with a scoop of chili bean sauce and soy sauce. Add water and let it come to a boil. In a separate pan, add a little more oil and saut&eacute; the veggies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in the sauce, add the tofu pieces and leave it to simmer. Take a serving bowl and plate the sauteed veggies first at the bottom. Top it up with the saucy tofu mixture. Garnish with spring onion.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Shilpa Shetty&rsquo;s go-to whole wheat toast with Tofu</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Ingredients: </strong>Whole wheat bread of choice, tofu, choice of veggies (onions, tomatoes, coriander), condiments (salt, pepper)</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong></p>

<p>Take a pan and scramble your tofu in a bit of oil, resembling closely paneer bhurji. Add in diced onions and tomatoes, along with salt and pepper. Let it cook until the texture is soft. Set it aside.</p>

<p>Nicely toast your bread slices until they&#39;re crispy on both sides. Top up the bread with the tofu mixture. Garnish with some coriander leaves. Serve hot.</p>

The netizens couldn&rsquo;t stop swooning over the imperfectionally perfect jodi. Vicky and Kat&rsquo;s jodi is like a straight-out Indian rom-com in which the wholesome Punjabi guy falls in love with a sophisticated foreign girl, and suddenly, &ldquo;Teri Ore&rdquo; starts playing in the background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, beyond these romantic fantasies lies reality, where real relationships come to the test. The spark is ephemeral, but a long-lasting companionship is based on factors that come with conscious learning and mutual growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When talking with Katrina, Vicky Kaushal dished out lessons on how to impress someone by being classy and chivalrous. Especially when the woman in front of you is so wise, poised, and breathtaking. So, let&rsquo;s look at everything Vicky did right to woo his woman of dreams:</p>

<p><strong>1. Proactive listener&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>While Katrina Kaif talked about her journey through the film industry, Kaushal intently listened to her. His proactive reactions and open-ended questions, when Katrina talked about film, family, and personal growth, proved how much he respected her. This is especially important when your partner is talking about something that is personal to her, you should listen intently, getting involved in the conversation as much as she is.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Maturity</strong></p>

<p>Maturity might just be the most important thing for a woman. When wanting to take things seriously, a woman would want to know about your maturity and emotional availability. While talking about stardom with Kat, Vicky told her that he likes to stay grounded and not let the stardom get to his head. This shows that the Chhava actor doesn&rsquo;t like to tag himself as superior and likes associating with people on equal footing. Something a woman would appreciate a lot in the patriarchal and alpha male world.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Gives importance to family&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Further adding to the above stardom point, Vicky shared how when he is at home, her mother confronts him with questions like, &ldquo;Aur, ban gaya Superstar?&rdquo; to keep him grounded. Taking cues from this anecdote, Kaif was quick to conclude that your mother seems to be a very wise person. To which, Vicky replied with an affectionate yes. Good family bonding is an important factor to learn about someone&rsquo;s emotional growth and perception towards mutual respect. If he respects his family, there is a high chance that &ldquo;being respectful&rdquo; is his second nature. However, lacking it doesn&rsquo;t define someone&rsquo;s character and emotional growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. They click and relate&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>While this is something that might not necessarily be in your hands, clicking in the first meeting is an excellent sign that the relationship might just be the one. The Merry Christmas actress and Kaushal could relate to each other right from their first meeting. The way they mingled was dreamy. For instance, while talking about success and failures, Vicky brought up a poem called If by Rudyard Kipling. He had not even completed his sentence, and Katrina guessed what he was trying to say. She added to his sentence, &ldquo;Success and failure are the same&rdquo;, being familiar with the same poem. If you can click and relate to the other person, it might be a great start towards a fulfilling journey.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Makes her laugh&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The great thing about the Bad Newz actor in his first meeting with Kat was that he was really candid and himself around her. Sharing an anecdote from his college days, Kaushal told the actress that he used to practice acting and expressions on her song, Teri Ore. Further adding cheekily that she is her &ldquo;Guru&rdquo;. Kaif burst into laughter after hearing this, blushing with cuteness. As they say, a couple who laugh together stay together. If you can make her laugh, you&rsquo;re golden. But don&rsquo;t try too hard. Be yourself, be candid, and learn what makes her chuckle heartily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mutual respect, proactive listening, and playfulness are a few of the many qualities that can define a perfect start to any relationship. However, carrying these qualities forward throughout the journey is what would define whether the relationship would last long or not.&nbsp;</p>

Having unapologetically accepted that she would rather have aloo paratha than have a zero-figure, the actress has time and again shared about her favorite dishes, which are often simple Indian food.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an interview, the crew actress revealed that since her mother is half-Indian, she often has Sindhi kadhi on Sundays. And the way Bebo almost drooled while talking about this Kadhi propelled us to share the recipe with you. So, let&rsquo;s get cooking!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Oil&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Cumin seeds (Jeera)</li>
	<li>Mustard seeds (Rai)</li>
	<li>Fenugreek seeds (Methi dana)</li>
	<li>Gram flour/chickpea flour (Besan)</li>
	<li>Curry Patta&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Asafoetida (Heeng)</li>
	<li>Hot water&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Turmeric powder (Haldi)</li>
	<li>Ginger&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Green chillis&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Kashmiri red chilli powder&nbsp;</li>
	<li>3 medium-sized tomatoes (For puree)</li>
	<li>3 medium-sized potatoes&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A bunch of cluster beans (Guar fali)</li>
	<li>Cauliflower&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Drumsticks (Sahjan fali)</li>
	<li>2 Eggplants&nbsp;</li>
	<li>10-12 Ocra (Bhindi)</li>
	<li>Tamarind pulp&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Salt&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How to make</strong></p>

<p>Typically, Sindhi Kadhi is made in a Sipri or Handi, which is a large, deep pot mostly used in Indian cooking. This pot is either made of clay, copper, or aluminium. However, if you don&rsquo;t have a Sipri, you can cook Sindhi Kadhi in a Kadahi, aka an Indian wok, or a stock pot. Ready with the gear? Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>

<ol>
	<li>Set your wok on the stove with a high flame</li>
	<li>Add 4 tbsp of oil to it</li>
	<li>Once the oil gets hot, add 1 tbsp jeera (cumin seeds), 1 tbsp rai (mustard seeds), and &frac12; tbsp fenugreek seeds. Stir them well and let them crackle</li>
	<li>Now, add two ladles of gram flour or besan to the pot and stir well on a low flame until the color of the besan turns light golden (Note that it is important to continuously stir so that the besan doesn&rsquo;t burn)</li>
	<li>Toss 10-12 kadhi patta and mix</li>
	<li>Add 1 L of hot water (Drizzle the water slowly while stirring at the same time so that chunks of besan cannot be formed and the mix comes out smoother)</li>
	<li>Now add another litre of water</li>
	<li>Add salt to taste&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add 1 tbsp turmeric powder&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add 1 tbsp Kashmiri red chilli powder&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Toss in 2 tbsp grated ginger&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add green chillis slit vertically&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Make a puree from three medium-sized tomatoes and add to the gravy&nbsp;</li>
	<li>On a high flame, stir the gravy well and bring it to a boil&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Once the gravy comes to a boil, add peeled and half-chopped drumsticks (Sahjan fali)</li>
	<li>Add one cup of cluster beans (Guar fali)</li>
	<li>Add 3 chopped potatoes (Cut the potatoes into quarters)</li>
	<li>Add half a cauliflower, chopped into pieces equal to the potato quarters&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Put a lid on the pot and let the curry simmer for a good 10 to 12 minutes, until it turns thick&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now, for the remaining veggies, take a pan and set it on the stove on a high flame&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add 1 tbsp of oil and let it heat up&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now add 9 to 10 washed orcas (bhindi) and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. No need to cut them into smaller pieces, just remove the ends.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Take out the bhindi in a bowl and the same pan, cook 2 quartered chopped brinjals (baingan) for 3 to 4 minutes.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Once the color of the curry enriches, add the fried veggies to it</li>
	<li>Close the lid again and let it simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes, on a medium-low flame&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After the curry is cooked and the veggies soften, add 2 tbsp of tamarind pulp (Imli ka gooda)</li>
</ol>

<p>Serve hot with steamed rice and your Sunday is set!</p>

When she isn&rsquo;t lighting up the big screen, attending events, or spending time with her loved ones, Alia finds joy in the little things, like sipping on a comforting cup of coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has always shared how a cup of coffee, the gentle breeze, and the shade of trees help her unwind. And she&rsquo;s not alone. For many people around the world, coffee is more than just a beverage; it&rsquo;s a warm hug in a cup, a moment of calm in a busy day.</p>

<p>But what makes coffee so special? Beyond its soothing effect and delicious taste, coffee actually comes with many health benefits when consumed in moderation. So if you&#39;re like Alia and love your coffee breaks, here&rsquo;s some good news: your favorite drink might be doing more good than you think.</p>

<p><strong>1. A Natural Energy Boost</strong></p>

<p>One of the main reasons people drink coffee is for its caffeine content. Caffeine is a natural stimulant that helps fight tiredness and boosts energy levels. It works by blocking the neurotransmitter adenosine in the brain, which increases the levels of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. As a result, you feel more awake, alert, and focused, perfect for getting through long shoots, early mornings, or simply getting things done.</p>

<p><strong>2. Supports Brain Health</strong></p>

<p>Research shows that drinking coffee regularly may help protect your brain. Studies suggest that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s. This could be due to the antioxidants found in coffee, along with caffeine&rsquo;s role in improving brain function. While coffee won&rsquo;t guarantee you never face these conditions, it may help reduce the risk over time.</p>

<p><strong>3. Full of Antioxidants</strong></p>

<p>Coffee is packed with antioxidants, which help fight free radicals in your body. These free radicals can damage your cells and contribute to aging and various diseases. In fact, for many people, coffee is the biggest source of antioxidants in their diet&mdash;more than fruits and vegetables. These antioxidants help support your immune system and reduce inflammation, which is key to staying healthy.</p>

<p><strong>4. May Boost Your Mood</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s no surprise that coffee can make you feel better&mdash;just the smell of it brewing can lift your spirits. But there&rsquo;s science behind this. Caffeine has been shown to increase the release of mood-enhancing neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Studies also suggest that regular coffee drinkers have a lower risk of depression and are generally less likely to feel down or low. For someone like Alia, who balances work, family, and pregnancy, a cup of coffee may offer a small yet meaningful mental boost.</p>

<p><strong>5. Can Help With Physical Performance</strong></p>

<p>Planning a workout? A cup of coffee before exercising might give you that extra push. Caffeine stimulates the nervous system and increases adrenaline levels, which can improve physical performance. That&rsquo;s why many athletes have a coffee before their training or competition. It may help you feel more energetic and even improve endurance during exercise.</p>

<p><strong>6. May Lower Risk of Certain Diseases</strong></p>

<p>Several studies have linked moderate coffee consumption with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. The antioxidants in coffee help reduce inflammation, improve blood vessel function, and support better metabolism&mdash;all of which play a role in preventing these chronic diseases. Of course, this doesn&#39;t mean you should rely only on coffee for your health, but it can be a helpful part of a balanced lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>7. Supports Digestive Health</strong></p>

<p>Many people find that a cup of coffee helps get their digestive system moving in the morning. Coffee can stimulate the muscles in your digestive tract and help you feel more regular. It also contains small amounts of soluble fiber, which is good for gut health.</p>

<p><strong>8. Balance Is Key</strong></p>

<p>While coffee has many benefits, it&rsquo;s important to drink it in moderation. Too much caffeine can cause jitteriness, trouble sleeping, or an increased heart rate in sensitive individuals. Most experts recommend keeping your coffee intake to about 3 to 4 cups per day. Also, try to avoid loading your cup with too much sugar or high-fat creamers, as these can reduce the health benefits.</p>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s on a film set, during a quiet afternoon at home, or while taking a walk under the trees, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/5-bizarre-and-unusual-beauty-hacks-by-b-town-divas-alia-bhatt-priyanka-chopra-and-katrina-kaif-1388093">Alia Bhatt</a> finds comfort in a simple cup of coffee, and now we know why. Coffee offers not only a moment of peace in a busy life but also a range of health benefits that can support your body and mind. So the next time you sit down with your favorite mug, remember: you&rsquo;re not just enjoying a drink, you&rsquo;re doing something good for yourself.</p>

In the pictures, he was seen carrying two large watermelons with a playful Korean caption that read, &ldquo;Selling watermelons&rdquo; or &ldquo;Watermelon for sale.&rdquo; Fans quickly reacted with love and laughter, with some joking that they&rsquo;d buy all the watermelons if Kim Seokjin was the one selling them.</p>

<p>While Jin&rsquo;s watermelon post continues to bring smiles, it also reminds us how refreshing and healthy this fruit truly is. Watermelon is more than just a sweet treat&mdash;especially in hot summer months, it&rsquo;s a favorite for many, and for good reason.</p>

<p><strong>Nature&rsquo;s Cool Gift in Hot Summers</strong></p>

<p>Nature has its own magic. Just as the weather becomes unbearably hot, fruits like watermelon arrive in the markets&mdash;nature&rsquo;s way of caring for us. At summer&rsquo;s peak, when heat drains our energy and dehydration is common, watermelon helps keep us cool and healthy.</p>

<p>In India, watermelon is mostly harvested during summer. In northern regions, sowing happens from February to March, with harvests from May to June. In southern and central areas, where the climate is milder, watermelon grows almost year-round, with major harvests from April to July. This timing perfectly matches the peak summer heat, making watermelon a refreshing seasonal favorite.</p>

<p><strong>Full of Water, Full of Health</strong></p>

<p>Watermelon is about 92 percent&nbsp;water, making it one of the best fruits to prevent dehydration. On hot days when we sweat a lot, eating watermelon helps replenish the fluids our body loses.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s more to it than just water. Watermelon is packed with nutrients like vitamin C, which boosts immunity, and vitamin A, which supports healthy skin and eyes. It also contains potassium, essential for heart health and blood pressure control.</p>

<p>One standout nutrient is lycopene&mdash;a powerful antioxidant that gives watermelon its red color. Lycopene benefits heart health and may help reduce the risk of certain cancers.</p>

<p><strong>Helps Digestion and Soothes the Stomach</strong></p>

<p>If you have a sensitive stomach, watermelon is an excellent choice. Its high water and fiber content make it gentle on digestion and can help prevent constipation. Many people who eat watermelon regularly during summer notice improved digestion.</p>

<p>Watermelon also contains an amino acid called citrulline, which helps improve blood flow and may reduce muscle soreness&mdash;making it a perfect fruit for those who exercise or work outdoors in the heat.</p>

<p><strong>A Sweet Treat That Tastes Even Better Cold</strong></p>

<p>One of the best things about watermelon is its natural, delicious sweetness that can brighten anyone&rsquo;s day. Chilled in the fridge, it becomes even more refreshing. Some people like to sprinkle a little salt on top&mdash;though it sounds unusual, the salt actually enhances the sweetness and adds a tasty twist.</p>

<p>Whether enjoyed in slices, cubes, or blended into juice, watermelon is always a summer favorite. It&rsquo;s also a popular ingredient in fruit salads and smoothies, making it a versatile and delightful treat.</p>

<p><strong>Easy to Eat, Hard to Resist</strong></p>

<p>Unlike many fruits that need time and effort to peel or cut, watermelon is super easy to prepare&mdash;just a few slices, and you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy. This makes it perfect for picnics, road trips, or a quick snack on a hot afternoon.</p>

<p>With its low calorie count and high water content, watermelon is also a smart choice for anyone aiming to eat healthy or lose weight. It keeps you full, hydrates your body, and satisfies your sweet tooth without loading on extra calories.</p>

<p><strong>A Summer Tradition full of Memories</strong></p>

<p>For many, eating watermelon in summer is more than just about health&mdash;it&rsquo;s about memories. Sitting outside with friends or family, sharing cold slices, laughing together&mdash;it all becomes part of a warm, joyful experience.</p>

<p>So next time the sun feels too hot, remember: nature has already given us a delicious solution. Grab a watermelon, chill it, maybe sprinkle a little salt, and enjoy. Just like <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/jins-vocals-are-so-heavenly-bts-army-goes-wild-over-his-live-performance-of-dont-say-you-love-me-1388177">BTS&#39; Jin</a>,&nbsp;let your summer be filled with smiles, good health, and sweet moments.</p>

Its leading ladies are no longer waiting for a Prince Charming to give their lives meaning. Instead, they&rsquo;re walking alone, confident, self-aware, and content. Films like Dear Zindagi and Piku offer a refreshing take on women who choose themselves first. These stories remind us that singlehood isn&rsquo;t a compromise; it&rsquo;s a choice, a space for growth, healing, and freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Zindagi</strong></p>

<p>Alia Bhatt&rsquo;s character Kaira in Dear Zindagi is young, ambitious, and emotionally tangled. As she juggles career struggles and failed relationships, the film zooms in on something Bollywood rarely explores&mdash;mental health. Enter Shah Rukh Khan as Dr. Jehangir, her therapist, who doesn&rsquo;t swoop in as a romantic hero but as someone who helps her understand herself.</p>

<p>What stands out is that Kaira doesn&rsquo;t find closure in a new romance. She finds it within. Her singlehood isn&rsquo;t painted in grey&mdash;it&rsquo;s full of color, hope, and clarity. It&rsquo;s a reminder that being alone can also be healing, even empowering.</p>

<p><strong>Piku</strong></p>

<p>Deepika Padukone&rsquo;s Piku lives life on her own terms. She juggles her demanding job and her aging father&rsquo;s needs with quiet strength. She&rsquo;s not searching for a partner. She&rsquo;s not portrayed as &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; without one. Instead, her character is built with depth, independence, and occasional emotional chaos&mdash;just like real women.</p>

<p>Her equation with Irrfan Khan&rsquo;s Rana is beautifully subtle. There&#39;s mutual respect, some unspoken affection, but no desperate love story. Piku shows us that a woman&rsquo;s journey doesn&rsquo;t need to be validated by a man standing at the finish line. Sometimes, walking alone is the most dignified way forward.</p>

<p><strong>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</strong></p>

<p>Though not centered on a woman&rsquo;s journey alone, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara presents a crucial perspective on love and timing through its characters. The film gently nudges us to slow down, live fully, and let things happen at their own pace. It tells us that love, when forced, loses its essence.</p>

<p>Katrina Kaif&rsquo;s Laila lives by that principle. She chooses the present, travels freely, loves fearlessly, and reminds us that you don&rsquo;t have to chase permanence. Sometimes, a moment of clarity on a beach in Spain is enough to change your life. It&rsquo;s not about having someone; it&rsquo;s about knowing yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Cocktail</strong></p>

<p>Cocktail dives into the complex layers of friendship and romantic confusion. But it&rsquo;s Veronica, played by Deepika Padukone, who steals the show. Bold, emotionally raw, and unapologetically herself, she&rsquo;s not your typical romantic heroine. She drinks, she parties, she feels too much, and when love isn&rsquo;t returned the way she gives it, she breaks but never loses herself.</p>

<p>Veronica shows that being single doesn&rsquo;t mean being empty. It&rsquo;s her journey of heartbreak and eventual self-acceptance that makes Cocktail so powerful. She may not get the guy, but she finds something far more lasting: self-worth.</p>

<p><strong>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil</strong></p>

<p>Karan Johar&rsquo;s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is messy, emotional, and layered. But within all its heartache lies a strange comfort. The story follows Ayan (Ranbir Kapoor) and Alizeh (Anushka Sharma), two people who can&rsquo;t be what the other wants. What stands out, though, is how Alizeh never compromises her emotional boundaries.</p>

<p>The film captures the confusion of loving someone who doesn&rsquo;t love you back&mdash;and the peace in accepting that. It might just make you feel grateful to be single. Because sometimes, loving yourself is safer than being stuck in one-sided love.</p>

<p><strong>Thappad</strong></p>

<p>In Thappad, Taapsee Pannu&rsquo;s Amrita is married and seems to have a settled life&mdash;until a single slap at a party changes everything. What follows isn&rsquo;t revenge, but self-realization. Amrita chooses to walk away from a toxic marriage, not out of anger, but out of self-respect.</p>

<p>Her decision to file for divorce and raise her child alone is not portrayed as a tragedy but as a quiet revolution. Thappad powerfully shows that being single after a marriage doesn&rsquo;t equate to failure&mdash;it can be a fresh start. Her courage to leave makes it one of the strongest portrayals of emotional independence in recent cinema.</p>

<p><strong>Queen</strong></p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t talk about singlehood in Bollywood without mentioning Queen. Rani (Kangana Ranaut), jilted by her fianc&eacute;, chooses to go on her honeymoon alone. What begins as an escape becomes a journey of liberation. From Paris to Amsterdam, she unlearns fear and rediscovers herself.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no romantic savior. No emotional dependence. Just a girl on the road, finding joy in the chaos. Rani doesn&rsquo;t return as someone who&rsquo;s &ldquo;better&rdquo; for a man&mdash;she comes back as someone better for herself.</p>

<p>These films don&rsquo;t treat singlehood as a temporary glitch in a woman&rsquo;s life. Instead, they celebrate it as a phase&mdash;or even a destination&mdash;filled with growth, agency, and peace. Whether it&rsquo;s a breakup, a divorce, or a conscious choice to stay single, the message is loud and clear: you can be whole all by yourself.</p>

The video took the internet by storm, with comments like &ldquo;Daddy is on duty&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gradually preparing to become a full-fledged father,&rdquo; flooding the post.</p>

<p><strong>Margherita Pizza &ndash; Classic and Simple</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<p><strong>For pizza dough:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Poha (flattened rice)</li>
	<li>1 medium-sized onion&nbsp;</li>
	<li>2 chillis&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Oil&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Mustard seeds&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Neem Patti (margosa leaves)</li>
	<li>Urad dal (Split white lentils)</li>
	<li>Turmeric&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Roasted peanuts&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Grated coconut (optional)</li>
	<li>Lemon&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Coriander leaves</li>
	<li>Salt&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Sugar&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to make Kanda Poha, the Nene way&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Soak the poha - Madhuri suggests poha needs to be washed and soaked for only around 5 minutes, unlike sabudana (tapioca pearl or sago).&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>While the poha soaks, chop the onions. Cooking along with Madhuri, Mr. Nene gets onto the chopping task, cutting those onions into half-moon shapes like a pro.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Cut chillis - Madhuri made it clear that she does not like too spicy. So the actress suggests cutting a chilli in half and not into too many pieces. This helps take out chillis while eating and prevents them from being in each bite.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now that the poha is soaked, put two tablespoons of oil in the pan. Acting like true Indians in the kitchen, the Nenes put oil in the pan by intuition and not by measurement.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When the oil gets hot, add mustard seeds to the pan. Wait for them to sputter before proceeding to the next step.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add 4-5 leaves of neem patti. But to avoid getting surprised like Nene, toss them carefully into the pan because they crackle and splutter.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add a tablespoon of urad dal. Now, this is Madhuri&rsquo;s way of making Kanda Poha. She likes to add a hint of South Indian taste to it.&nbsp; Also, she enjoys the urad dal&rsquo;s crunchiness with the damp poha.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Once the urad dal turns slightly brown, add the Kanda aka onion. While adding the onions, Mr. Nene delightfully relishes in their aroma, enjoying the process to the fullest.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>After the onion softens, add turmeric. Dixit likes her onions crunchy in her poha, so she doesn&rsquo;t completely cook and soften them. While cooking, she also shared a little anecdote of when her mother used to make curd-poha sans turmeric.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now, goes in the main ingredient, your soaked poha. Mix the poha with the cooked onions well enough so each flattened rice is covered with the prepared tempering.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add salt to your taste and a bit of sugar to the prepared poha. The sugar helps create a balanced taste profile, cutting the overpowering taste of spices and salt.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The poha is almost ready, but a Maharashtrian kanda poha is incomplete without roasted peanuts. Toss in some roasted peanuts for an enriched taste. Dixit likes to keep the peanut peel on; you can peel them off if you want.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Now comes the magical ingredient. Squeeze a lemon in for that irresistible tanginess. Madhuri suggests squeezing the lemons after the plating so that each one can have the zest to fit their taste.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Lastly, throw in some fresh coriander leaves for a complete and authentic kanda poha taste. And as Madhuri rightly said, you can either put a lot of coriander or the minimum amount, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter. However, what matters is that you place at least some coriander leaves on your poha.&nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Referring to the Maharashtrian food buffs, the Maja Ma actress suggests adding grated coconut to your poha. However, it&rsquo;s optional.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Hailing from the same Maharashtrian roots, Madhuri Dixit and Dr. Nene dished out the ultimate Kanda poha recipe while giving a glimpse of their unparalleled companionship. Rightfully concluding their poha-making process, Dr. Nene said, &ldquo;The journey is as good as the destination&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

Speaking about the diva, she trusts in the goodness of Turai (known as Ridge gourd) and has often incorporated it in her meals.</p>

<p>Well, Turai happens to be one of the most common vegetables inside any Indian kitchen and is used in a variety of forms, including subzi, chutney, and so much more.</p>

<p>Despite its multiple uses and commonality, the ridge gourd is also something that is not liked by many and people prefer not to have it in their meals. Its neutral flavor is perceived as bland and is one of the most common reasons why Turai is neglected.</p>

<p>Moreover, some even find its texture firm and different from other vegetables, a common misconception about the ridge gourd.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Turai has some amazing health benefits, which actually make it a superfood addition to most meals. Check them out:</p>

<p><strong>1. Improves vision</strong></p>

<p>Turai contains a high amount of vitamin A, which helps improve eyesight for all ages. It prevents macular degeneration, partial blindness and other eye ailments. It also has beta carotene, which rids toxins from the optical nerve and visual blood vessels.</p>

<p><strong>2. Prevents anaemia</strong></p>

<p>Turai is rich in iron and it acts as a natural guard to prevent anemia in the body. It also has vitamin B6, which looks after the proper synthesis of red blood cells. It also relieves feelings of fatigue and pain.</p>

<p><strong>3. Boosts weight loss</strong></p>

<p>Despite being rich in vitamins and nutrients, ridge gourd is low in calories and has a huge amount of water retention. The flesh of the vegetable has an abundance of cellulose, which is an important dietary fiber.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Promotes liver function</strong></p>

<p>Turai helps in purifying blood vessels of the body and aids in getting rid of all toxins. It thus augments liver function and digestive capabilities and also treats jaundice and other such infections.</p>

<p><strong>5. Revitalises skin</strong></p>

<p>Having turai in your meals is a great boon for the skin. It is a rich source of vitamins A and C, which are known for their antioxidant potential. It reduces damage to skin tissues, revitalizes it and promotes good blood flow for curing all outer layer imperfections.&nbsp;</p>

Beyond trendy materials, aesthetically pleasing wallpapers, and affluent marbles, Bollywood celebrities, too, strive to infuse personal touches in their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s maximalist approach towards home interiors to Mira Kapoor&rsquo;s minimal aesthetic, this is how Bollywood celebrities personalized their abodes:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Madhuri Dixit - MF Hussain paintings&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hailing from the era of dramatic films, Madhuri Dixit&rsquo;s approach in real life is quite the opposite. She prefers calmness and serenity, and it shows in her house too. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/madhuri-dixit-birthday-actress-husband-shriram-nene-says-id-choose-you-all-over-again-drops-pics-ft-sons-ryan-and-arin-1387904">Madhuri Dixit and Mr. Nene</a> planned a home that was minimal, soothing, and comprised of sophisticated elements. However, they wanted to add a pop of color to the neutral-palette theme. So, the couple and architect, Apoorva Shroff of Lyth Design, worked alongside MF Hussain and infused his exclusive paintings in their home.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Mira Kapoor - Earthy and Sandy tones&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just like her high-end socialite energy, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/mira-kapoor-birthday-when-shahid-kapoors-wife-asked-this-unexpected-question-during-her-first-visit-to-his-house-post-engagement-1346299">Mira Kapoor</a> keeps her Mumbai home clean and sophisticated. Going for the trendy minimalist theme, Kapoor&rsquo;s master bedroom features a sandy, dual-toned wallpaper from Phillip Jeffries. This unique wallpaper features a woven texture, bringing a feeling of serenity to the room. Complemented with a light-colored palette like white sofas and a wooden table, Mira and Shahid Kapoor&rsquo;s home encompasses both&ndash; space for entertainment and relaxation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Ananya Panday - Powder pink aesthetic&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/call-me-bae-2-we-cant-keep-calm-after-knowing-this-big-update-from-ananya-panday-led-web-series-upcoming-season-1387727">Ananya Panday</a> dreamt about having her own house someday, and just at the age of 25, she achieved her dream. To make sure that her first home turned out just perfect, she teamed up with Gauri Khan as her interior designer. Panday wanted her space to be an extension of her personality. Thus, starting right from the entrance to her curtain and closet, Ananya imbued powder pink in every nook and corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Sonam Kapoor - Tanjore and Chinese glass paintings&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Whether it be fashion or home interiors, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/sonam-kapoor-and-hubby-anand-ahuja-acquire-mumbais-renowned-rhythm-house-for-whopping-rs-47-8-crore-report-1354963">Sonam Kapoor&rsquo;s</a> approach to art is never basic. Inspired by the opulence and intricacies of havelis and antique stores, Kapoor developed a taste that encompasses heritage. Hence, she embedded her home with Rajasthani jali, Jaipur&rsquo;s chandelier, and Mughal zardozi cushions. Her living room is maximally decorated with Tanjore and Chinese glass paintings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Alaya F - Cane Chandelier&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Being a true Mumbaikar at heart, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/fashion/CelebFashion/alaya-f-wears-cocktail-ready-saree-with-bralette-blouse-worth-rs-141750-and-it-reminds-us-of-deepika-padukone-1270027">Alaya F</a> created a home that pushes her to hustle. Alaya F&rsquo;s Mumbai home encompasses warmth like none other. With a neutral-toned theme and texture, the actress&rsquo;s home is a work of art. The most stunning element of her home is the cane chandelier, which looks intricate and artistic, and something derived from nature. Other elements of her home, such as woven rugs and ceramics, complement Alaya&rsquo;s home&rsquo;s earthy properties.</p>

From traveling between countries to constantly juggling through projects, even a few hours of quality time with the partner becomes a task in itself. However, B-town couples, though always on top of their work, rarely hesitate to sacrifice work for love.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Sonam Kapoor to Kareena Kapoor Khan, Bollywood celebrities&rsquo; marriage advice emerges as a beacon of hope for even the most work-surrounded and ambitious couples.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>1. Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The international couple, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/nick-jonas-reveals-when-he-knew-wife-priyanka-chopra-was-the-one-once-we-started-dating-1387943">Priyanka Chopra</a> and Nick Jonas, have a married life that involves a lot of traveling. Priyanka has made it clear that both she and Jonas are extremely hardworking people, and they love their job. Yet, when the time comes, they never forget to prioritize each other and give their family of three a jolly good time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>India&rsquo;s beloved lovebirds, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/prasanna-ho-watch-how-anushka-sharma-virat-kohli-respond-to-premanand-ji-maharajs-question-1387407">Anushka Sharma</a> and Virat Kohli, are looked up to as an idol couple. However, since the two hail from different industries, the companionship often comes from a place of conscious effort. While Virat does not miss any opportunity to reach out to his wife on the field, Sharma constantly supports her husband through thick and thin. The lesson is simple: sometimes showing up for each other is all you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Kareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/kareena-kapoor-opens-up-on-embracing-aging-reveals-what-she-does-to-keep-skin-treatment-and-botox-at-bay-1380396">Kareena Kapoor Khan</a> and Saif Ali Khan&rsquo;s wedding stirred a buzz around the town back in 2012. This was particularly challenging to Kareena, as she was still at the peak of her career. When confronted with apprehensions that she might not get any films after the wedding, our Bebo was adamant about changing this outdated belief. When it comes to the couple, Kareena and Saif made a decision to do one film each and save time to spend with each other and their kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Ramleela couple Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh&rsquo;s successful marriage emerges from their friendship. When they&rsquo;re together, they are relaxed and have enough to talk about, as they come from the same industry. However, apart from a smooth companionship, there are a few ground rules that define their marriage. This includes not staying out too late or missing calls while at work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The actor-entrepreneur couple, Sonam Kapoor and Anand Ahuja, have a schedule that does not contain the same elements of work. This calls out for actively extracting those time blocks from their schedule for each other, where their alignment could be restored. Kapoor admits that, pragmatically, their relationship thrives on the give-and-take concept. Also, saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to certain projects to be with her family sometimes becomes important, and the same goes for Anand Ahuja.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>6. Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>SRK and Gauri&rsquo;s love and married life isn&rsquo;t any less than a romantic movie. Gauri, being a model previously, has been Shah Rukh&rsquo;s number one supporter from his earlier days in the industry. SRK, on the other hand, encourages Gauri&rsquo;s strong identity as a successful interior designer. However, being a superstar comes with its own share of sacrifices. Given that, the couple and their kids are often seen at public events like IPL and wedding galas together, making sure that if they cannot miss an event, they can bring their family to the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7. Genelia D&rsquo;Souza and Ritesh Deshmukh</strong></p>

<p>Despite being in the same industry and going through different work schedules, Ritesh and Genelia have their own ways of spending quality time with each other. They base their relationship on friendship and playfulness, keeping the flame alive through humor-infused love. From their funny reels on married life to their public declaration of love and companionship, the couple never refrain from admitting that they do prioritize each other on and off work.</p>

<p><strong>1. Increased humidity</strong></p>

<p>Being a coastal city, Mumbai&rsquo;s humidity levels are at the highest during monsoons. With heavy rainfall, there is increased water vapor in the air.</p>

<p><strong>2. Enhanced hues of sunset</strong></p>

<p>Considering the high humidity levels, the dust particles in the air deflect and scatter differently, leading to vibrant hues in the sky. The sunsets begin to look more daunting and spirited.</p>

<p><strong>3. Heavy cloud cover</strong></p>

<p>Despite the rains taking a brief pause, the Mumbai skies remain cloudy almost all monsoon. This adds a dramatic impact to the sunset moments, intensifying it so much more.</p>

<p><strong>4. Diffused sun rays</strong></p>

<p>With thick cloud cover comes somewhat diffused sun rays, due to the difficulty in penetration. The sunsets look like a palette of warm colours infused with stray sun rays.</p>

<p><strong>5. Arabian Sea as the backdrop</strong></p>

<p>A city bursting with so much energy, the Mumbai skyline offers a dramatic impact to the sunset along with the breathtaking view of the Arabian sea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The typical sunset sky in the city of dreams during monsoon turns into hues of vibrant orange, red along with some dimmed shades of mauve, maroon, and gold. Agree or not, the monsoon is the best time for clicking some gorgeous sunset photos of the Mumbai skyline.</p>

<p>Imagine a mind-blowing view of the setting sun against the Arabian Sea; does it not remind you of the iconic scene of Ranbir Kapoor and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/when-deepika-padukone-and-alia-bhatt-had-to-use-the-mens-loo-in-berlin-and-the-reason-will-leave-you-in-splits-1387033">Deepika Padukone</a> from Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani?</p>

Virushka continues to win hearts with their oh-so-mushy gestures for one another.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s your cue to note these 11 signs in your partner that prove you&rsquo;re dating a green flag as well!</p>

<p><strong>1. Never misses important dates</strong></p>

<p>Virat Kohli proves to be the dreamiest partner ever. Despite his hectic schedule, he never misses out on important dates, including his wife&rsquo;s birthdays, their anniversary, and even their kids&rsquo; special moments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Date nights are a must</strong></p>

<p>Work is erratic, but spending quality time with your partner is essential too. Virat Kohli makes sure he steps out of his fixed schedule and goes on impromptu dates, be it a simple stroll on the streets or binge-eating in a favorite cafe.</p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t shy away from PDA</strong></p>

<p>A little PDA is the secret spice to a happy relationship, and Virat agrees with it. While love is a concept understood in mind, simple gestures like holding hands, a kiss on the head, or just helping your partner handle lots of loads in hand are a great mark as well.</p>

<p><strong>4. Partner is your first priority</strong></p>

<p>For Virat Kohli, Anushka Sharma is the priority at times, both good and bad. For a massive sixer at the cricket field to a wicket lost, every achievement of his is incomplete without a call to his better half, who stands by him at all times.</p>

<p><strong>5. Visits religious places together</strong></p>

<p>Virat Kohli, who once claimed he&rsquo;s not the &lsquo;pooja-paath types,&rsquo; has now completely evolved. He changed himself after marrying Anushka, and now the two regularly visit religious places together.</p>

<p>While some people credit OMAD for its radical effect in weight loss, experts do not advise this method to everyone. Going for one meal a day might only work for people who have insulin resistance and/or are prediabetic. As OMAD leads to a calorie deficit, this method can be counterproductive for people whose bodies demand more physical labour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the film director, he practised the OMAD method with awareness about his health and under proper guidance. This intermittent fasting concept might result in nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss, or bone density problems, so it must be scrutinised and practised carefully.&nbsp;</p>

Known for his heartwarming aura and transformative spiritual lessons, the revered Guru isn&rsquo;t only a beacon of enlightenment for common folks, but he also influences the lives of celebrities such as Hema Malini and Mika Singh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the top 5 lessons that Premanand Ji Maharaj taught while in conversation with Indian celebrities:</p>

<p><strong>1. Blessings</strong></p>

<p>In conversation with Anushka Sharma and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/health-fitness/virat-kohlis-5-strict-fitness-rules-breakfast-routine-and-water-that-costs-rs-4000-per-liter-1387295">Virat Kohli</a>, Premanand Ji imparted an important life lesson about what God&rsquo;s blessings truly are. Guru Ji explained that glory, reputation, profit, and wins, which are often mistaken as God&rsquo;s blessings, are actually only the merit of good deeds. God&rsquo;s true blessings lie in one&rsquo;s internal contemplation. He concluded that the source of happiness isn&rsquo;t materialistic wins but internal peace.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Resilience&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When Bollywood actor, Ashustosh Rana, visited Premanand Ji to seek his blessings, he admired the Guru&rsquo;s exceptional health and wellness. In a shocking revelation, Premanand Ji disclosed that he has been suffering from both Kidney failure for two decades and that he goes through dialysis every day. Despite this health condition, Premanand Ji walks with power and resilience and laughs with ecstasy, as he blesses his disciples, and sets inspiration for living in bliss despite the condition.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Devotion&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When Hema Malini visited Premanand Ji to seek enlightenment about the career challenges she would face, Guru Ji gave her an unparalleled teaching. He noticed Malini adorned a &lsquo;tilak&rsquo; on her forehead and asked if she was devoted to Shri Krishna. When the actress nodded, Guru Ji said that one who is devoted to &lsquo;Hari&rsquo; (Krishna), even a bit, can not only achieve materialistic success, but also spiritual success.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Purity&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/mika-singh-urges-everyone-to-forgive-samay-raina-and-ranveer-allahbadia-for-indias-got-latent-controversy-they-are-kids-who-1376298">Mika Singh</a> visited Guru Ji, a disciple talked about living in a metropolitan city and achieving internal purity and positivity, referring to the singer&rsquo;s concerns. Premanand Ji admitted that one needs to be utterly cautious and aware in such a situation. He said that when you&rsquo;re surrounded by a company and environment that has no limit for sinful eating and drinking, and physical boundaries, right thinking and good deeds come as a shock&mdash;a challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spiritual leader answered, if our eating ethics and character aren&#39;t&nbsp;pure, our karmas cannot achieve purity. Guru Ji added that even a shift from one sinful habit towards a good deed can put you on the path of righteousness.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Bliss&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>B Praak&rsquo;s bhajan evening in Vrindavan was delightful, but his conversation with Premanand Ji was even more blissful. When B Praak admitted his devotion towards Hari and the chant &lsquo;Radhey Radhey&rsquo;, Guru Ji gave him transformative life advice. He said that life&rsquo;s like sea tides; it&#39;s sometimes favourable, and other times miserable. He advised&mdash;never to lose your strength and hope.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further concluded that one who remains in company with saints and spiritual disciples, and aligns with the spiritual power, isn&rsquo;t dependent on favorable and unfavorable conditions for happiness. Such a person always remains in a blissful state of mind, regardless of the situation.&nbsp;</p>

This day is all about expressing your undying love and commitment, as couples come together to celebrate their bond. It&#39;s a time to unapologetically share your affection and spend the day doing what you love most. Gift-giving plays a key role in making the day even more special.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>Write a heartfelt letter or craft a sweet poem that speaks the language of love. You can also recreate your first date or enjoy couple&rsquo;s activities that deepen your bond.</p>

<h3><strong>Eccentric Valentine&rsquo;s Traditions from All Around the World</strong></h3>

<p><strong>South Korea:</strong> In this East Asian country, women traditionally give chocolate to their partners on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, while a month later, on White Day, men return the gesture. This adds a unique twist to the typical Valentine&rsquo;s celebration. Then, on April 14, single people gather to celebrate Black Day by enjoying jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) with their fellow singles.</p>

<p><strong>Wales: </strong>In this country, the day of love is celebrated on January 25, honoring St. Dwynwen, the Welsh messenger of love. This decades-old tradition sees Welsh men carving love spoons by hand and giving them to the women they are interested in. The spoons often feature hidden symbols and clues, adding an intriguing twist to the custom.</p>

<p><strong>Iraq:</strong> Iraqi Kurds dedicate the day to the original lovers, Adam and Eve. They put a unique spin on the Biblical story of the couple eating a red apple by gifting red apples to their partners in memory of the first humans, celebrating love and prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>Guatemala: </strong>The Central American country hosts flamboyant love parades to celebrate the day. Older individuals dress in colorful clothes, masks, and feathers to celebrate El D&iacute;a del Cari&ntilde;o or the Day of Affection.</p>

<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is the perfect occasion to celebrate the love and affection couples share. It honors the purity of love in all its glory, with each day dedicated to a unique theme. This is a special time to focus solely on your relationship, and this calendar should help you plan, avoiding any last-minute rush. The week following Valentine&rsquo;s Week is known as Anti-Valentine&rsquo;s Week, featuring Slap Day, Kick Day, Perfume Day, Flirt Day, Confession Day, Missing Day, and Breakup Day. It&rsquo;s all about letting go of past traumas, removing toxicity, and making an effort to start fresh.</p>

50. &quot;Always be ready to adjust, recalibrate, and stay after it to become better, somehow.&quot;</p>

<p>51. &ldquo;When you think that you are done, you&rsquo;re only 40% in to what your body&rsquo;s capable of doing. That&rsquo;s just the limits that we put on ourselves.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
52. &quot;The hero is you.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
53. &ldquo;Pain unlocks a secret doorway in the mind, one that leads to both peak performance, and beautiful silence.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
54. &quot;It may be satisfactory, but that&#39;s another word for mediocrity.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
55. &ldquo;From the time you take your first breath, you become eligible to die. You also become eligible to find your greatness and become the one warrior.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
56. &ldquo;Only you can master your mind, which is what it takes to live a bold life filled with accomplishments most people consider beyond their capability.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
57. &quot;The more things you can do to get outside of that zone that makes you feel good, the stronger your mind is going to get. It&rsquo;s not fun, but now my mind is used to it.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
58. &ldquo;The most important conversations you&rsquo;ll ever have are the ones you&rsquo;ll have with yourself.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
59. &quot;Fear is my ultimate guide.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
60. &quot;It&rsquo;s funny, humans tend to hatch our most challenging goals and dreams, the ones that demand our greatest effort yet promise absolutely nothing when we are tucked into our comfort zones.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
61. &quot;We can&rsquo;t control all the variables in our lives. It&rsquo;s about what we do with opportunities revoked or presented to us that determine how a story ends.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
62. &quot;We all need small sparks, small accomplishments in our lives to fuel the big ones. Think of your small accomplishments as kindling. When you want a bonfire, you don&rsquo;t start by lighting a big log. You collect some witch&rsquo;s hair&mdash;a small pile of hay or some dry, dead grass. You light that, and then add small sticks and bigger sticks before you feed your tree stump into the blaze. Because it&rsquo;s the small sparks, which start small fires, that eventually build enough heat to burn the whole fucking forest down.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
63. &quot;Become a savage and live life on your own terms.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
64. &ldquo;Your entitled mind is dead weight. Cut it loose. Don&rsquo;t focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim on what you are willing to earn!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
65. &ldquo;I was the sum total of the obstacles I&rsquo;d overcome.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
66. &quot;No one is going to come help you. No one is coming to save you.&quot;</p>

<p>Life is like a roller-coaster &mdash; full of ups and downs &mdash; and can throw a curveball anytime! When going through a difficult time, it&rsquo;s important to surround ourselves with positive people and thoughts. This helps one stay motivated and find a silver lining even in the most challenging situation.

There could be plenty of reasons behind an ex reaching out to you. However, you need to respond with clarity and honesty. You don&rsquo;t have to pretend to be okay. All that you need to do is define clear boundaries. If you are not willing to speak to your ex-partner, don&rsquo;t force yourself to respond to his or her texts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you are genuinely interested, then respond to the messages with a good intention and avoid gauging between emotions. Ideally, it is recommended to take a break from each other during the healing phase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, that you have found all the reasons, refrain from asking, &ldquo;Why is my ex texting me?&rdquo; Instead, analyze the situation, try to resolve issues if any, respond with a sense of concern, or simply out of humanity. There are no hard or fast rules to get back or to ignore his or her messages. Every relationship is unique and every couple&rsquo;s way of dealing with things and issues differs.</p>

<p>As we grow older, we often struggle to make new friends or maintain a stable relationship with the ones we already have. Life intervenes and it&rsquo;s normal for friends to grow apart with time. But we should keep in mind that sustaining social connections is the key to healthy living. While it is important to initiate new friendships, one should not forget their old friends who helped them cope with hardships in the process. A balance between the two will ensure a life enriched with contentment.&nbsp;</p>

It should be for all the right reasons such as:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Your relationship is fixable</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You have changed for the better</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can rebuild trust</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You are willing to work to get back together</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Taking the time to think about what went wrong in the relationship can help you determine whether the relationship is worth working on once again. Bring up the possibility of getting back together and having a trial period in case necessary. A trial period will give you and your ex time to get back into the routine of things.</p>

<p>After trying out every single step, you can easily crack the code to how to get your ex-girlfriend back. When the time is right to reconnect, approach her with sincerity and a fresh perspective. Show that you&rsquo;ve learned from the past and are prepared to communicate openly, fostering an environment of trust and respect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is both of you that have truly grown and healed. Hence, there is a potential for a more meaningful relationship. Trust the process, leave it to God, and remember that the journey towards love often starts from within.</p>

Here Are 20 Telltale Signs]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-11/1544526680_select-2024-11-07t175546-758.jpg"></img><ul>
	<li>
	<p>The first step is acceptance. You need to accept that you have a crush on someone and that it is okay.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Don&rsquo;t lose yourself. Focus on yourself and prioritize your own mental well-being.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Develop a realistic viewpoint. Change your perspective and look at the situation from afar. You will soon realize that your crush is just like other people.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Don&rsquo;t idolize them. When we fall for someone we tend to put them on a pedestal, which leads to us overlooking their flaws.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Keep yourself busy. Distract yourself by focusing on work and pursuing your hobbies. You can watch movies, hang out with friends, or read a book.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Give your mind a break from constantly thinking about them. Don&rsquo;t let your feelings for them consume all your thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you still find yourself hovering over his profile, it&rsquo;s better to stay away from social media for the time being.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you&rsquo;re committed to someone, try to focus on your current relationship. It&rsquo;s not something unnatural. But try to keep a respectful distance between you and your crush.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Crushes are momentary. When you have a crush on someone, your feelings towards them will falter with time. But on the other hand, if you notice that your feelings are only getting stronger, you might be in love with them. If you find yourself wondering &ldquo;How do I know if I have a crush&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s better to do your own research and be sure of your feelings, before you approach them. It&rsquo;s up to you to decide if it&rsquo;s just a casual crush or something serious. It&rsquo;s important to understand the difference between having a crush on someone and being obsessed with them. In the case of the latter, you can seek professional help. Try to divert your attention and distance yourself from the person in question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>191. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Chandler to my Monica.&rdquo;</p>

<p>192. &nbsp;&ldquo;God sent you on earth with a mission, that is to be my boyfriend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>193. &nbsp;&ldquo;I attempted to rearrange the alphabet and put &lsquo;U&rsquo; and &lsquo;I&rsquo; together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>194. &nbsp;&ldquo;I almost fainted after looking at my X-ray report. My heart was missing. Then I remembered that I gave it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>195. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you more than cats love fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>196. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for the day I can roll over and give you a morning kiss, instead of sending a morning text.&rdquo;</p>

<p>197. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no! I like you more than I planned to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>198. &nbsp;&ldquo;My dopamine levels go crazy when I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>199. &nbsp;&ldquo;Can I borrow a kiss? I promise to give it back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>200. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have already taken your heart. There is no refund.&rdquo;</p>

<p>201. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the cheese to my mac.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>202. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my missing piece. You came into my life and completed the puzzle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>203. &ldquo;Your love is like a sweet melody that plays gently on the strings of my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>204. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my one in the five billion.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>205. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a photographer. But I can see a perfect photo of you and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>206. &ldquo;Saying I love you would be an understatement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>207. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m given a hundred choices, I would choose you every time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>208. &ldquo;Your hugs are the best stress-busters&rdquo;</p>

<p>209. &ldquo;Sometimes I stare at you and wonder if I truly deserve you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>210. &ldquo;My name somehow sounds better when you say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>211. &ldquo;I want to treat you like a prince and give you the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>212. &ldquo;Your presence brightens up even the gloomiest days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>213. &ldquo;No other man in the world can hold a candle to your charm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>214. &ldquo;A million kisses to the most amazing man I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>215. &ldquo;You make me feel like I&rsquo;m living inside my favorite romcom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>216. &ldquo;If life is a game, you&rsquo;re the only teammate I need.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>217. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my dream come true and I promise to cherish you forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>219. &ldquo;You look so handsome in the mornings. And evenings. And nights!&rdquo;</p>

<p>220. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m collecting cute things. Can I keep you?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Relationships are delicate and need transparency to work. A moment of misunderstanding can destroy the strongest of bonds. Be it an old relationship or a new one, you need to handle it with care. A big part of it is being able to say the right thing at the right moment. Relationships will reach a point where they feel stagnant. You might feel like there&rsquo;s nothing new for you two to explore. And that&rsquo;s exactly where you&rsquo;re wrong. Say cute things to your boyfriend, surprise him, and make him realize his importance in your life.&nbsp;</p>

Jot down a few fragrance notes that describe your partner well. For instance, if they are really sweet, go for gourmand scents like vanilla, and if they are always energized and never seem tired, go for citrusy scents like bergamot. Next, get scented candles customized using these notes. This would make a sweet, personalized, and thoughtful gift idea.</p>

<p><strong>50. Specially-curated Gourmet Box:</strong></p>

<p>Everyone likes a sweet treat! That&rsquo;s what makes a gourmet dessert box an excellent 6th anniversary gift idea for your partner. You can curate brownies, blondies, cupcakes, and biscottis to go into it. Remember to keep items with dark chocolate, as it can be an excellent aphrodisiac.</p>

<p><strong>51. Monogrammed Charcuterie Boards:</strong></p>

<p>If you and your partner love a great charcuterie meal with wine from time to time, a custom monogrammed charcuterie board would be an excellent gift idea for them!</p>

<p><strong>52. Custom-beaded Bracelet:</strong></p>

<p>As a throwback to your college romance days, you can gift your beau an adorable custom-beaded bracelet with their name engraved on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>53. Specially-curated Toiletries:</strong></p>

<p>For romantic spa dates and self-care sessions, you can gift a set of personalized, premium toiletries to your partner. This could comprise shower gels, body butters, bath bombs, essential oils, mists, scrubs, and lotions. Ensure you keep your partner&rsquo;s skin type and allergies in mind before gifting this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>54. Monogrammed Aprons:</strong></p>

<p>Love cooking sessions with your partner? A set of matching monogrammed aprons would then make a super-cute, useful, and personalized anniversary gift for them.</p>

<p><strong>55. Write Them a Song:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">If you&rsquo;re a bit musical, put your talents to good use by writing a song for your partner and singing it on your 6th anniversary day as a heartwarming gift!</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;ve included a detailed list of 6th anniversary gift ideas, remember that there&rsquo;s no iron rule to be followed here! You should feel free to gift your partner what you want and even tweak or customize these ideas as per your partner&rsquo;s liking. If you and your partner don&rsquo;t appreciate much clutter or hoarding on materials, DIY gifts such as writing your own story, or song, or cooking a meal can go a long way. We hope you enjoyed these ideas!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">As you mark your sixth anniversary, let these creative gift ideas inspire you to celebrate your love in a meaningful way. Whether you choose a tangible gift or an unforgettable experience, what truly matters is the thought and care you put into it.

May you have many wonderful years ahead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>95.&nbsp;&ldquo;I knew you two were madly in love with each other but didn&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;d be mad enough to marry. Have a great life ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>96.&nbsp;&ldquo;No amount of wishes or luck will protect you from the painful life of slavery you are about to start as a husband. Congratulations anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>97.&nbsp;&ldquo;You fantasize about lovely and beautiful things for your marriage; soon you will dream about living alone surrounded by motionless hands of time. Just kidding. Enjoy your wedding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>98.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are actually shown some respect when priests ask you to say &lsquo;I do.&rsquo; Else it&rsquo;s not that you have any other choice either. Happy married life ahead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>99.&nbsp;&ldquo;In the circus of life, you may have lived like a lion so far. But your wife, the new circus master, will tame you into a domesticated cat in no time. Good luck with your tightrope act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>100.&nbsp;&ldquo;Marriage marks the end of a love story and the start of a wrestling match. Wishing you the very best of everything anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>101.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like paying EMIs of your under-construction house. But here you keep paying EMIs for your entire life and never even get to say a word. Wishing you a happy married life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>102.&nbsp;&ldquo;You are so excited to make your partner happy and loved always. Then you will find out that you did nothing but annoy each other instead. Congratulations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>103.&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, now it&rsquo;s the beginning of the end for you. No more beers, no more night out with the guys but at least you have a loving wife. Congrats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>104. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t just tied the knot with your wife today; you have tied ropes on your legs too. Congratulations on your wedding. The only difference between marriage and stupidity is that marriage is expensive while stupidity comes free of cost. Congratulations on being expensively stupid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>105.&nbsp;&ldquo;Guess you two were madly in love with each other. From now onward it would just be madness. Happy married life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>106.&nbsp;&ldquo;Congratulations on your wedding day&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t bothered buying you both a present. It would just be something else to fight over when you get divorced!&rdquo;</p>

<p>107.&nbsp;&ldquo;Knowing the entrepreneurial couple that you are, I was wondering if you could give me some insider tips so I can place my bets on how long you both will last. Congratulations on getting hitched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>108.&nbsp;&ldquo;Getting married is a two-way street &ndash; do all you can to avoid head-on collisions. A life loved is precious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>109.&nbsp;&ldquo;A successful marriage relies heavily on communication. No matter who is right or who is wrong. It&#39;s about who can concoct the most persuasive contention!&rdquo;</p>

<p>110.&nbsp;&ldquo;Marriage is said to be about giving and receiving. Give your spouse a hard time and take all the credit for being right. Everyone benefits from this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>111.&nbsp;&ldquo;The most important rule of marriage is this: Life and wife are happy. And if the wife is unhappy, just keep giving her chocolate until she forgets what was bothering her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>112.&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to keep your marriage&#39;s romance alive? Make breakfast in bed a surprise for your spouse. A toaster waffle and a cup of coffee constitute breakfast. Isn&#39;t the thought what matters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>113. &ldquo;Continuously recall, in marriage, compromise is fundamental. Thus, if your life partner needs to watch a heartfelt film, split the difference by allowing them to watch it single-handedly while you make up for lost time with your sporting event!&rdquo;</p>

<p>114.&nbsp;&ldquo;Laughter has been touted as the best remedy, and this is true in marriages as well. Therefore, make it a daily habit to crack jokes at each other. It&#39;s a great way to maintain love and laughter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>115. &ldquo;Keep in mind, marriage resembles a long-distance race. Thus, ensure you&#39;re consistently one stride ahead by concealing the television remote. It is certain to keep your spouse following you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>116.&nbsp;&ldquo;Even if you are unable to identify what you did wrong, apologize and ask your spouse to explain. It keeps peace and saves time!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to meaningful advice and a listening ear, humor can be a great way to soothe the anxiety of married couples. It can help them navigate the perks and challenges of married life and embrace them all with grace. The above-mentioned funny marriage quotes help with that!

After all, they are the ones who genuinely want you to succeed, even if that means not sugarcoating words and telling you how to do things better for your own future. Life is long and most people don&rsquo;t want to be stuck with a partner that doesn&rsquo;t know how to provide encouragement and motivation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So if you have found yourself a woman who criticizes you constructively for your own good and always urges you to hone your skills and make improvements, stick to her and understand that she&rsquo;s doing all this out of love and is the one for you!</p>

<h3><strong>16. You Feel Comfortable in Each Other&rsquo;s Presence&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>There is some warmth and serenity when spending time with our special one &mdash; even if there is complete silence, the happiness you get in each other&rsquo;s arms can&rsquo;t be compared to any of the world&rsquo;s luxuries. We all want comfort in life, especially when we want to settle down in a relationship!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being able to be truly yourself, not hiding your quirks, being the goofball you are, and feeling comfortable around the person you love is a wish we all have. So if you feel that comfort around your partner, this is a clear sign that you both are meant for each other.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>17. You Imagine Her in the Future</strong></h3>

<p>Do you always envision her in your future? Say you&rsquo;re planning to buy a house or a car &mdash; if at the back of your mind, you always think about her likes and dislikes, it means that the love is stored. Plus, if she too feels the same, it means you both desire to be in a committed relationship.</p>

<h3><strong>18. You Love Each Other</strong></h3>

<p>This one is a no-brainer &mdash; if there&rsquo;s mutual respect between the both of you and you love each other, she is the one for you and you are the one for her!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Sometimes, in love, our minds stop working &mdash; we are so much in love that we tend to look past our beloved&rsquo;s flaws and other things that could potentially harm the relationship. At other times, we are also confused and don&rsquo;t understand if the other person thinks love is as much as we love them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our detailed guide on how to know if she is the one can help you answer many questions concerning your relationship and take the next step. Remember that not all the parameters will be checked by your significant other &mdash; but if she ticks most of the boxes and you are sure that you both are meant for each other, you can take your relationship to the next level!</p>

<p>Not your anniversary? You can pick some items from this list to gift your friends or family on their special day as well. When choosing a 5-year anniversary gift, you need to keep the recipient&rsquo;s hobbies and interests in mind. The five-year milestone is a reminder that you have come a long way. That is why it needs to be as special as your partner is.</p>

To keep boredom away and make your partner feel good, you can sometimes take part in your beloved&rsquo;s hobbies and grow as a couple.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>20. But Don&#39;t Forget to Be Active In Your Interests Too</strong></h3>

<p>A sense of individualism shouldn&rsquo;t be lost if you are in a relationship. It&rsquo;s great to make time for his hobbies, but at the same time, don&rsquo;t forget the authentic you and take active participation in your hobbies and interests too. This way, you&rsquo;ll keep growing as an individual and be happy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>21. Apologize If You Have Made a Mistake</strong></h3>

<p>This is a no-brainer relationship rule! If you have made a mistake, simply say sorry and try not to repeat the mistake.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>22. Accept Your Partner&#39;s Apology</strong></h3>

<p>A relationship is a two-way street. If your partner has made a mistake, try to forgive him/her and make it a point not to bring past mistakes to the present date.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>23. No Place for a Third Wheel in a Relationship&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Everyone has a past and one can&rsquo;t erase it but there&rsquo;s also no need to sulk about the past, ruining what you have in the present. Say your partner is not comfortable with you being in touch with that toxic ex of yours &mdash; it&rsquo;s your responsibility to make your special one feel secure and do the same. All in all, you should set a rule for both of you that no third person can come in the way of your relationship and jeopardize it. For this, you&rsquo;ll need to be honest with your partner and have complete trust in one another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That being said, in order to make your partner feel secure, don&rsquo;t lose yourself. Once again, setting healthy and clear boundaries can help you avoid such conflicts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Relationships require a couple to put in consistent efforts, dedication, and hard work to make it work. Despite that, some relationships fail, sometimes due to a lack of communication, dishonesty, fidelity, lack of space, and many more reasons. Making relationship rules and abiding by them from the heart can help a couple stay happy and have a fulfilling relationship. While all of these relationship rules might not work for all, as there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;One size fits all&rdquo; in a relationship, choosing a few rules and setting healthy boundaries can help a couple grow together in a better way.&nbsp;</p>

Don&rsquo;t Text Too Often:</strong></p>

<p>This is not about playing hard to get. However, you don&rsquo;t want to seem too available either as it does not make a great impression. Besides, you should allow her some time to miss you as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Don&rsquo;t Make Her Wait Too Long:</strong></p>

<p>Having mentioned the above point, it is also important that you don&rsquo;t make her wait too long. This would make her feel that you&rsquo;re uninterested and eventually she&rsquo;ll lose interest as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Don&rsquo;t Send Lazy, One-word Replies:</strong></p>

<p>This shows a lack of interest, too! Besides, one-word replies can make you seem arrogant and deprive her of learning any good things about you, which would easily put her off.</p>

<p><strong>4. Don&rsquo;t Text At the Wrong Hour:</strong></p>

<p>Texting her after midnight or during busy hours of the day can seem annoying and inappropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Don&rsquo;t Be Inappropriate:</strong></p>

<p>In the endeavor of flirting with her, ensure you don&rsquo;t make indecent or suggestive comments. This can creep her out and make her feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>6. Don&rsquo;t Make Insensitive Jokes:</strong></p>

<p>While humor is great, you should test the waters first to see what kind of jokes she is comfortable with. Don&rsquo;t be too sardonic or make caustic remarks that may seem too personal. Avoid sounding like a misogynist, racist, homophobe, etc. The idea is simple &mdash; just be a decent person. If opening with humor, make sure your jokes are not too political or touch upon any religion, community, nationality, economic strata, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The above-mentioned texts to make her want you are perfect for getting a girl&rsquo;s attention. Whether you want to break the ice with a girl, keep a conversation going, or make your partner feel loved &mdash; these texts can help you express yourself better. You can also tweak or personalize these texts to add a personal touch and make the girl feel more special.&nbsp;</p>
