Their return signals more than nostalgia; it restores the emotional core that has shaped the slasher saga for decades. As Sidney Prescott and Gale Weathers, the duo has anchored the series through shifting timelines, rising body counts, and evolving horror tropes. It is a powerful continuation of one of horror&rsquo;s most iconic female dynamics.<br />
<br />
<strong>Courteney Cox and&nbsp;Neve Campbell reunite for Scream 7</strong><br />
<br />
For Courteney Cox, stepping back into Gale&rsquo;s shoes alongside Campbell felt instinctive. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long, it seems like we grew up together. Gale and Sidney will always have some issues, but working together is the most comfortable thing in the world for us. It&rsquo;s the way it should be,&rdquo; she said. Their off-screen familiarity continues to fuel the layered tension and loyalty that defines their on-screen characters.</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/6-hollywood-theatrical-releases-this-week-feb-23-28-2026-from-scream-7-to-epic-elvis-presley-in-concert-1400988?amp">Neve Campbell</a> echoed&nbsp;the sentiment, reflecting on how the characters&rsquo; bond has matured. &ldquo;Their love-hate relationship has always been a lot of fun. We get to see more of that this time as they become even closer. Gale brings so much humor to these films and Courteney adds an important layer of humanity to her,&rdquo; she said. The evolving camaraderie promises emotional depth amid the terror.<br />
<br />
<strong>About the film Scream 7</strong><br />
<br />
Scream 7 is helmed by Kevin Williamson, who also worked on the screenplay of the film. With legacy characters reclaiming the spotlight, Scream 7 aims to balance suspense, wit, and character-driven storytelling. Paramount Pictures India will release the film in cinemas on February 27, 2026.</p>

<p>On February 23, 2026, local time, it was confirmed that Robert Carradine passed away via a note from his family to Deadline. The actor was known for his work in projects like The Long Riders, Revenge of the Nerds, and most prominently, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/10-actresses-who-made-powerful-comebacks-after-break-from-drew-barrymore-to-jennifer-lopez-1389848">Lizzie McGuire</a>. His demise has invited tributes from fellow co-stars and many who crossed paths with him during his long career.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robert Carradine passes away, family note confirms</strong></p>

<p>The family of the star shared the confirmation as follows, &ldquo;It is with profound sadness that we must share that our beloved father, grandfather, uncle, and brother Robert Carradine has passed away. In a world that can feel so dark, Bobby was always a beacon on light to everyone around him. We are bereft at the loss of this beautiful soul and want to acknowledge Bobby&rsquo;s valiant struggle against his nearly two-decade battle with Bipolar Disorder. We hope his journey can shine a light and encourage addressing the stigma that attaches to mental illness. At this time we ask for the privacy to grieve this unfathomable loss. With gratitude for your understanding and compassion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, his on-screen daughter, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/makeup/hilary-duff-plastic-surgery-1251030">Hilary Duff</a>, who played the titular character on Lizzie McGuire,&nbsp;took to her social media to share her sorrow, &ldquo;This one hurts. It&rsquo;s really hard to face this reality about an old friend. There was so much warmth in the McGuire family ,and I always felt so cared for by my on-screen parents. I&rsquo;ll be forever grateful for that. I&rsquo;m deeply sad to learn Bobby was suffering. My heart aches for him, his family, and everyone who loved him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Other actors on the show also remembered the late star for his talent. &ldquo;My heart hurts today. I was fortunate to know Bobby for most of my life. And he was one of the coolest guys you could ever meet. Funny, pragmatic, sometimes cranky, always a little eccentric,&rdquo; said Jake Thomas. He recalled their fond memories on the set and praised his acting, music, and directing skills.</p>

<p>Lalaine, who played Miranda Sanchez, spoke about how unfair it was, &ldquo;I am thankful tho. (though) Thankful I had time with you, thankful for our last conversation, and your constant fatherly like support. I love you Bobby.&rdquo;</p>

Hosted by Alan Cumming, the 79th British Academy Film Awards was a star-studded affair with the biggest stars in attendance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the winners of the night, Paul Thomas Anderson&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/one-battle-after-another-exclusive-leonardo-dicaprio-on-his-dream-collaboration-with-benicio-del-toro-and-their-camaraderie-1396785">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>-led&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/one-battle-after-another-review-leonardo-dicaprio-presents-value-for-money-hilarity-with-punch-in-the-gut-emotion-1397201">One Battle After Another</a> was the biggest earner with an impressive 6 grabs. Michael B. Jordan&rsquo;s Sinners followed with 3 of its own. Robert Aramayo, who led I Swear,&nbsp;was the most welcome surprise, winning the coveted Best Leading Actor award among some of the best contenders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the biggest shock remained Marty Supreme, which was given no trophies even after being in the running for a whopping 11. The Josh Safdie sports dramedy tied 1969 film Women in Love and 2004&rsquo;s Finding Neverland in doing so. The latter two went on to nab one Oscar each, meaning all hope is not lost for the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/timothee-chalamet-goes-instagram-official-with-kylie-jenner-after-dating-for-3-years-tremendously-grateful-1399867">Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet</a> starrer, which did get big wins at Critics Choice Awards and the Golden Globes.</p>

The couple that has been going out for a while now, made sure the world knew they were together in an undeniable PDA moment at the award ceremony. With a cheek kiss, the That&#39;s So True singer sealed it in for her boyfriend, who she came in to support for how work with Hamnet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re taking a look at the couple&rsquo;s journey from strangers to lovers.</p>

<p><strong>June 2024: First spotting</strong><br />
Just weeks after fans began connecting the dots about the two being in cahoots, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/isnt-that-devastating-gladiator-ii-star-paul-mescal-reveals-how-untrue-rumors-of-one-night-stands-affected-his-mom-1353648">Paul Mescal</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/happy-birthday-gracie-abrams-top-10-songs-to-listen-to-as-singer-turns-25-1345849">Gracie Abrams</a> were spotted by TMZ, with him reaching out to cup her face at a food outing. Prior to this, many even speculated that she had given a nod to the actor&rsquo;s Normal People role in her song Normal Thing, writing, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a normal thing to fall in love with movie stars. When the lights are low, and red at all their favorite bars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They continued to be spotted together, including a Mayfair shopping outing and other small dates around. They&rsquo;re called to be like &lsquo;any other young couple&rsquo; by a source speaking to The Sun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>August 2024: London kisses</strong><br />
The two were once again photographed by paparazzi but this time in a manner that almost confirmed their romance. Daily Mail shared snaps of them holding hands while in London, with an onlooker claiming they were &lsquo;kissing a lot.&rsquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been hooking up and it&rsquo;s still early stages,&rdquo; a source then said to PEOPLE.</p>

<p><strong>September 2024: Public dating</strong><br />
The two finally decided to go public with a stroll hand-in-hand. A laid-back date, their outing was a clear declaration of the new romance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>October 2024: Eras Tour&nbsp;</strong><br />
Paul Mescal was there to support his girlfriend, Gracie Abrams, as she opened for Taylor Swift at the Eras Tour in Miami, where he interacted with fellow concertgoers from a VIP section of the crowd. Many casual dates across the country followed.&nbsp;</p>

The duo attended the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-when-paul-mescal-claimed-hed-be-in-a-bad-spot-if-gladiator-2-makes-him-a-household-name-more-people-will-stop-you-1362267">Gladiator II</a> premiere after-party together and made their first work-related appearance beside each other. Their coordinated knit outfits only added to the charm. He then supported her once again at the Saturday Night Live after party the following month.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>February 2025: High bars</strong><br />
Gracie Abrams spoke about having a high bar in her relationships while speaking to Cosmopolitan. She did not mention her beau by name but hinted at how their dating phase was going with, &ldquo;My current form of love feels like home no matter where I am,&rdquo; and added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s literally nothing better than being with somebody where you&rsquo;re not putting on a performance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>May 2025: Reverse support</strong><br />
The History of Sound premiere at the Cannes Film Festival saw the American star make an appearance for her man, still not making it a couple&rsquo;s outing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>June 2025: Festival date and going Instagram official&nbsp;</strong><br />
The duo was spotted enjoying Olivia Rodrigo&rsquo;s set, and she made it semi-Instagram official with a clip of her sitting on his shoulders as the singer belted The Cure&rsquo;s Friday I&rsquo;m In Love. Soon after, they were official on social media as she shared photos from their day out with friends at the music festival and captioned it with all hearts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>January 2026: Surprise confessions</strong><br />
During Hamnet promotions, Gracie Abrams shared a photo of her partner, who plays William Shakespeare in the film, and wrote, &ldquo;Also I love him surprise.&rdquo; She praised his co-stars in an emotional update.&nbsp;</p>

His family shared a confirmation, as reported by PEOPLE, that he had breathed his last surrounded by his family and close friends following a battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that lasted around a year after being publicly revealed in April 2025. Now, a new interview has been released by Netflix, taken before the actor&rsquo;s passing, covering some of his last words to the world. It held a special message to his two kids, Billie and Georgia.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane speaks to teenage daughters in a chat revealed posthumously</strong></p>

<p>As a part of the platform&rsquo;s interview series, Famous Last Words, Eric Dane&rsquo;s final chat in front of the camera was revealed to the world. It included a confirmation on both sides that the same would be shared only after his passing. So, one day later, it was released globally for the fans of the star. He spoke to his children while looking at the camera to the best of his ability, and said, &ldquo;Billie and Georgia, these words are for you. I tried. I stumbled sometimes, but I tried. Overall, we had a blast, didn&rsquo;t we? I remember all the times we spent at the beach, the two of you, me and mom &mdash; in Santa Monica, Hawaii, Mexico. I see you now playing in the ocean for hours, my water babies. Those days, pun intended, were heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to share four of his biggest learnings in life, with the advice to live in the present being his first. He wanted them to cherish every moment and not dwell on the past, unlike what he did. The Euphoria star also wished his kids could be in love, whether with another person or something, and that it was for them to decide. He went on to share his passion for acting and how it brought him the best and some of the worst days in his life. His third piece of advice was to find friends who are not just there for the good bits but also the bad ones, and don&rsquo;t hesitate to call you out on it, as they are the ones who can shape you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, he shared how they must not stop fighting and wanting to live no matter what. &ldquo;Fight with every ounce of your being, and with dignity. When you face challenges, health or otherwise, fight. Never give up. Fight until your last breath. This disease is slowly taking my body, but it will never take my spirit,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Eric Dane&rsquo;s final words follow his family&rsquo;s request for privacy as they grieve, and amid countless <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/eric-dane-passes-away-greys-anatomys-kevin-mckidd-euphorias-sam-levinson-and-nina-dobrev-share-tributes-1400910">co-stars and fans&rsquo; tributes</a>.

Actress Replaces Engagement Ring With Gold Band]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1508315441_zendaya-tom-holland-1.webp"></img><p>Tinsel Town&rsquo;s favorite couple, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/are-zendaya-and-tom-holland-expecting-their-first-child-amidst-wedding-rumors-heres-what-we-know-1400556">Tom Holland and Zendaya</a>, got engaged back in December 2024 over the holidays. With many speculations surrounding their impending marriage, the two have remained tight-lipped about it, choosing to be as private as possible. However, a recent update seems to have their fans jumping around in excitement. On February 18 local time, the Dune actress was spotted in Beverly Hills with a gold band on her ring finger, raising speculations of a secret wedding to the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-tom-holland-blend-romance-and-work-with-london-walk-and-indian-lunch-on-spider-man-set-1395388">Spider-Man</a> himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zendaya and Tom Holland may have gotten married secretly, and here&rsquo;s what we know about it</strong></p>

<p>As per a Hello! report, the 29-year-old was photographed alongside film producer Josh Lieberman in Los Angeles on Wednesday. While going for a laid-back look in a white jacket over a plain T-shirt and some loose trousers, it was her hand that grabbed the most eyeballs. It was belatedly shared that she had swapped out her 5-carat diamond ring from fianc&eacute; Tom Holland for a shiny gold band on her ring finger, leading to questions about whether the two lovers had gotten married in a secret ceremony already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-drops-her-cutesy-throwback-pic-to-celebrate-28th-birthday-pens-truly-means-the-world-to-me-1345546">Zendaya</a> and Tom Holland have not commented on the same, the same could very well be possible for the couple, who have always opted for privacy around their relationship. Previously, there were a lot of questions about the duo possibly getting married this year; however, her close friend and popular stylist, Law Roach, had shared in July 2025 that the process hadn&rsquo;t even been started back then. Six months on, and we think it&rsquo;s very much achievable that the two held a small ceremony without the knowledge of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After dating since 2021, the couple chose not to announce their engagement, but the actress stepped onto the Golden Globes 2025 red carpet with a new sparkler on her finger, confirming it. Later, a source shared that the proposal happened over the holidays in December 2024. She was seen frequenting the set of his films in recent months, as the couple spent every possible moment together between busy schedules.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane&rsquo;s peers remember the actor following his passing</strong></p>

<p>Euphoria creator Sam Levinson revealed he is &lsquo;heartbroken&rsquo; by the loss of his &lsquo;dear friend,&rsquo; and added, &quot;Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift. Eric&#39;s family is in our prayers. May his memory be for a blessing.&quot;</p>

<p>Fellow actors on Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy, Kevin McKidd, James Pickens Jr. and Sarah Drew shared a photo of the star on their Instagram stories and wrote, &quot;Rest in Peace, Buddy,&quot; and &quot;Rest in peace.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;RIP, Buddy.

Good guy. Too soon. Xo J,&rdquo; John Stamos wrote on his social media.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ashton Kutcher wrote on X (formerly Twitter) about how the Franklin strip fanatics fantasy football league will miss the star and is sure that he&rsquo;ll be watching from above. He also vowed to join the fight to solve ALS.</p>

<p>His Charmed co-star Alyssa Milano recalled his warm existence and love for his family, &quot;He loved the absurdity of things. He loved catching people off guard. And when it came to his daughters and Rebecca [Gayheart], everything in him softened. He carried them with him even in rooms where they weren&#39;t present. You could see it in the way his voice changed when he said their names. ... The spark. The mischief. The tenderness he kept guarded but never totally hidden.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Vampire Diaries star Nina Dobrev, who worked with the actor on Redeeming Love,&nbsp;called him &lsquo;warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate&rsquo; about his work, leading with kindness and making others feel welcomed. She hopes his demise can result in more research on ALS.</p>

Here’s What We Know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/797628544_chloe-zhao-tom-cruise.webp"></img><p>The Mission Impossible grapevine has a new update, but it&rsquo;s not one the fans are necessarily happy about. Recently, reports have surfaced that the Tom Cruise-led daredevil franchise will return with yet another part despite the actor previously stating that it would end with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-cruise-bids-farewell-to-mission-impossible-at-2025-cannes-film-festival-grateful-to-entertain-1388001">Mission: Impossible &ndash; The Final Reckoning</a>. However, a report by popular tabloid Deux Moi has shaken the world of Hollywood once again as it has shared that Hamnet&rsquo;s star director <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-harish-patel-reveals-what-eternals-director-chloe-zhao-said-when-he-congratulated-her-nomadland">Chlo&eacute; Zhao</a> has been in talks with the 63-year-old for a project which is believed to be MI9.</p>

<p><strong>Mission: Impossible &ndash; The Final Reckoning, not the end for Tom Cruise&#39;s Ethan Hunt? Here&rsquo;s all we know</strong></p>

<p>With &lsquo;Final&rsquo; in its name, many were accepting of the fact that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-cruise-bags-gold-mission-impossible-star-lands-guinness-world-record-for-highest-burning-parachute-jumps-1390799">Tom Cruise</a> would bring an end to his beloved but dangerous franchise of the Mission Impossible films, and so he claimed. But new murmurs have hinted that he may have changed his mind already, within a year of saying so. According to a report from the gossip outlet&rsquo;s anonymous tip, &ldquo;Chlo&eacute; Zhao is in talks to write/direct. Tom sought her out, they&rsquo;ve workshopped a treatment, script is underway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long time, Christopher McQuarrie has been the captain of the ship, forging his way ahead with some fabulous and some lukewarm receptions of the MI world&rsquo;s four films. With a supposed change in direction, one can hope there&rsquo;ll be a change in the outcome. But all of this remains mere hearsay for the time being, with no official confirmations or denials from either side.</p>

<p>As of now, Tom Cruise&rsquo;s Ethan Hunt had his grand goodbye in the 8th instalment while awaiting the release of his Alejandro G. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu directorial Digger. On the other hand, Chlo&eacute; Zhao remains dedicated to her Oscars campaign for her historical drama film Hamnet. A frontrunner for multiple accolades, the Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal starrer has been in the good graces of plenty to have a believable shot at a win, or more.&nbsp;It is up for 8 awards, across major categories including Best Picture, Best Director (Chlo&eacute; Zhao), and Best Actress (Jessie Buckley).</p>

The couple, which has always been talked about for their long-running romance and possible troubles, has handled having a baby wonderfully well, always hanging out around the child and taking him to places. The model has repeatedly <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/hailey-bieber-opens-up-about-baby-no-2-plans-says-she-now-feels-ready-for-another-child-1398587">spoken about wanting more kids</a> with her partner and has now revealed what motherhood has been like for her.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hailey Bieber wants at least a second kid, but may end up having more</strong></p>

<p>During an appearance on Jake Shane&#39;s podcast Therapuss, the skincare entrepreneur opened up about coming to terms with motherhood for the first time, &quot;It is so fun. I always knew I wanted kids; I always wanted to be a mom. And then when it happens, you never know what to expect, and you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going to be like.&rdquo; She spoke about how Jack Blues is already interested in basketball and is now learning to speak &lsquo;please,&rsquo; something which he already knew how to do with the American Sign Language before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing that there were many unexpected parts of her relationship with her first child, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/hailey-biebers-team-says-her-billion-dollar-rhode-deal-has-no-ties-to-justins-scooter-braun-settlement-1394083">Hailey Bieber</a> added that one would not be able to prepare for until they&rsquo;re at that stage. But there was one thing that surely surprised her, &ldquo;I feel like I&#39;m a lot more relaxed as a mom than I thought I would be. I think especially as a first-time mom.&quot;</p>

<p>Revealing her plans to grow their family with more kids, the 29-year-old reiterated, &ldquo;I definitely do want one more. I&#39;m not in a rush, but I definitely want one more. Maybe I&#39;ll have four more. Maybe I&#39;ll have three. I don&#39;t know, I really don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just taking it one day at a time.&rdquo;</p>

The Spider-Man: Homecoming co-stars have been dating for a long time. And during a recent chat for Interview Magazine with her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-robert-pattinson-engaged-first-look-at-their-sparkling-romance-in-the-drama-1399039">The Drama</a> co-star Robert Pattinson, the actress was quizzed about her red flags, and right as she was speaking, her boyfriend successfully revealed how he passed the test, without even saying a word.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zendaya shares how Tom Holland overcomes a big relationship red flag for her</strong></p>

<p>Talking about the distinction between a real red flag and some things that people can only learn after being with someone, she shared how it&rsquo;s important to her how people treat their crew. Which actors are welcomed on set and said it&rsquo;s telling of people about how they behave when the cameras are not rolling. At the same time, another very important litmus test for the 29-year-old is how people behave with and around animals, as the Euphoria star would surely get into a fight for her pet. She believes that dogs are a good judge of character.</p>

<p>Immediately after, it is noted that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-holland-expresses-his-love-for-zendayas-dog-via-this-heartfelt-gesture-find-out-1366966">her dog</a> barked on seeing Tom Holland, who had returned home, a fact the actress very easily sews into the conversation. And just like that, without even doing or saying anything, her fianc&eacute; is given the clean chit by her excited dog. Robert Pattinson further questions her if she decides someone is good or bad instinctively, within seconds of meeting them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She agrees and disagrees equally, explaining it as, &quot;People are layered and complex, and they make mistakes. There are cultural differences. But there are also things that are just kind of, &#39;Well, that&rsquo;s rude. That&rsquo;s mean.&#39; And there&rsquo;s also the opposite. You can know someone for a long time, and they can change, or you get to know them on a deeper level, and you&rsquo;re like, &#39;Whoa. I didn&rsquo;t see &nbsp;that side of you.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the couple got engaged back in December 2024, making it public during a red carpet appearance in January 2025.&nbsp;</p>

The couple who dated in the early 2010s and got married, only to split up and then get back together, has seemingly ended things once and for all. Their breakup is not recent, though, as Page Six reported that the couple has been separated for about a year now.</p>

<p>Shia LaBeouf and wife <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/elizabeth-debicki-discusses-her-role-in-maxxxine-and-her-aversion-to-horror-films-details-1323098">Mia Goth</a> have split up, as per the latest reports. The couple seemingly broke up a year ago, and the coverage says it happened &lsquo;nearly a year ago.&rsquo; However, the status of their relationship currently remains unclear, as reports have cited that it is unknown whether the two have filed for a divorce after all.</p>

<p><strong>Mia Goth and Shia LaBeouf&rsquo;s relationship timeline</strong></p>

<p>The duo is infamous for their on-again, off-again relationship ever since they got together back in 2012 when they met while working together on Nymphomaniac. They dated for a while before getting married four years later in a Las Vegas ceremony in October 2016 in a famed USD 700 ceremony that was talked about for days owing to its absolute budgeted expense. They tied the knot at the Viva Las Vegas wedding chapel as a part of its Blue Hawaii package. However, officials later claimed that they were not legally married, but were instead involved in a commitment ceremony.</p>

<p>Their whirlwind romance and follow-up nuptials came to an end as it was reported that the two filed for divorce in September 2018. At the time, it was noted that the separation was &lsquo;amicable&rsquo;. However, it did not last long as the pair was back again, prancing around with matching couple rings in March 2020 in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With more twists and turns in their relationship than one can imagine, they announced that they were expecting their first child by February 2022. Their daughter was born in March 2022 and was named Isabel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of February 2026, it is believed that the two have officially split; however, it is unknown if they were legally married all this time and if they decided to file for divorce once again.&nbsp;</p>

Rapper Responds Post Super Bowl LX Breakup Rumors]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1692507733_cardi-b-stefon-diggs.webp"></img><p>Is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/has-cardi-b-broken-up-with-stefon-diggs-singer-deletes-all-traces-of-boyfriend-amid-offset-drama-1393149">Cardi B</a> back on the market? It seems that the American rapper has split from her baby daddy after all. The rumors of her breakup with NFL player Stefon Diggs have been rampant ever since the two unfollowed each other post Super Bowl LX. Now, during a new appearance, the WAP hitmaker seemingly confirmed that they have ended their relationship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cardi B addresses Stefon Diggs breakup rumors&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Taking to the stage for her Little Miss Drama Tour&rsquo;s Los Angeles stop on Sunday night, the rapper reacted to the ongoing tensions surrounding her and fellow rapper BIA. She was precise and to the point while responding to the same, saying, &ldquo;Just because I ain&rsquo;t f&ndash;king with my baby daddy doesn&rsquo;t mean you get to talk about my baby daddy.&rdquo; Her comments have essentially confirmed that she and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/cardi-b-confirms-4th-pregnancy-rapper-expecting-first-child-with-nfl-star-stefon-diggs-im-excited-1396946">Stefon Diggs</a>, the father of her fourth child, a son, are no longer dating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This rant comes amid the two unfollowing each other during Super Bowl LX, where the sportsman&rsquo;s team New England Patriots, lost against the Seattle Seahawks with a score of 29-13. The murmurs of their supposed breakup have been rampant on the internet since. Meanwhile, the rapper was spotted exiting the Levi&rsquo;s stadium right after featuring in the Halftime Show headlined by Bad Bunny, where she performed and went back without waiting for the game to finish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 33-year-old was previously asked about any words of support for her then-beau ahead of the Super Bowl game, and only managed to mutter a simple &lsquo;Good luck&rsquo;, then walked away. The beef between Cardi B and BIA has been going on for a while, with the former claiming that the latter dissed her children, while the latter accuses her of copying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an interaction with the media, the 29-year-old was asked by reporters about the Super Bowl after the 2026 NBA All-Star Game. However, he had an interesting response, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mexican, I didn&rsquo;t watch to be completely honest.&rdquo; His remarks have come between talks of rumored beef between Jenner&rsquo;s multiple ex-boyfriends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The socialite herself has remained dedicated to her support for her former partners, including appearing at the Super Bowl to watch Bad Bunny, while in the VIP area alongside her older sister, Kim Kardashian, who is rumored to be dating her other ex-boyfriend, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-lewis-hamilton-and-kim-kardashian-just-confirm-their-romance-super-bowl-lx-appearance-raises-eyebrows-1400574">Lewis Hamilton</a>.

He will be headlining his first-ever show in the country on March 29, as revealed on Monday. It was announced that the American star will be performing at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi.</p>

<p><strong>Ye locks India debut with Delhi show</strong></p>

<p>Kanye West has finally confirmed his first show in India,&nbsp;as revealed on February 1, 2026. The singer will perform his debut stadium concert called Ye Live as his exclusive performance at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi. One of the most awaited performers in the American music scene for India, the rapper is being hailed for his confirmed show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As per organizers, fans of the star can expect &lsquo;expansive staging, cinematic large-format visuals, precision-engineered acoustics, and a career-spanning setlist&rsquo; from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/has-kanye-west-officially-changed-his-name-to-ye-ye-heres-what-we-know-amid-custody-battle-with-kim-kardashian-1391683">Ye</a>.

From the first announcement, it has become the attention grabber, and any whiff of an update gets the maximum interest from the world. One of the frontrunners for the titular role has been British actor Callum Turner,&nbsp;who many have voiced to be a fitting choice, and during his appearance at the latest Berlinale, the star remained tight-lipped about the possible casting, sharing that it was still too early for those questions.</p>

<p><strong>Callum Turner makes a firm remark to James Bond casting questions in Berlin</strong></p>

<p>Right off the bat on the first day of press for his film Rosebush Pruning at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival, Callum Turner was questioned about his possible appearance as the famed spy. As reported by Variety, the journalist noted that the query may be one that could be gotten out of the way owing to his attendance at the press conference, the actor shared, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s very early for that question.&rdquo; He is said to have added with a &lsquo;slight smirk,&rsquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to comment on it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To add to the fun of it, co-star Tracy Letts decided to get some giggles and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m the next James Bond!&rdquo; While everyone, including Turner, managed to push out a smile and keep it light, replying, &ldquo;Tracy, I thought you weren&rsquo;t going to say anything.&rdquo; It is no question that the 60-year-old is not the next James Bond, but during the Berlin Film Festival running from Thursday, February 12, 2026, to Sunday, February 22, 2026, many would be content considering him so.</p>

<p>So far, apart from the 35-year-old fianc&eacute; of Dua Lipa, Jacob Elordi, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/tom-holland-reacts-to-james-bond-casting-buzz-as-villeneuve-and-knight-join-007-reboot-1394973">Tom Holland</a>, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Anthony Boyle, Leo Suter, Harris Dickinson, Reg&eacute;-Jean Page, and Idris Elba, are among the many names being discussed for the role, with the first one on the list reportedly already having <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/jacob-elordi-locked-as-new-james-bond-after-oscars-nomination-actor-secretly-meets-denis-villeneuve-report-1400166">met with the star director</a>. The toss remains in the air with more speculations for the next 007 role coming up every day.</p>

Following the oldest son&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckham-says-no-to-reconciliation-with-family-accuses-mom-victoria-of-calling-him-evil-endless-attacks-1400055">6-page rant</a> accusing his parents of trying to control his life and creating a rift between him and wife Nicola Peltz, another one of the attendees of the wedding has stepped up to clarify that nothing &lsquo;salacious&rsquo; went down on the dance floor between the mother and son duo. He also offered words of advice for the young chef, placing his trust in friend <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-beckham-is-devastated-as-son-brooklyn-covers-up-dad-tattoo-amid-family-feud-feels-like-a-deep-cut-1400516">David Beckham</a> to get the family back together.</p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Beckham vs family feud gets a new perspective from Gordon Ramsay</strong></p>

Speaking to The Sun about the ongoing Beckham family feud, he shared the truth from the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckhams-wedding-dj-reveals-truth-about-mom-victorias-humiliating-dance-says-nicola-peltz-ran-out-crying-1400172">Brooklyn Beckham-Nicola Peltz wedding</a> and pointed out that the groom&rsquo;s mom, Victoria, definitely did not do anything out of order,&nbsp;&ldquo;There was nothing salacious. There was nothing inappropriate. Everyone was having fun, having a dance.&rdquo; He added that she&rsquo;s definitely upset over her son&rsquo;s behavior, but her &lsquo;great sense of humour&rsquo; will have her sorted out soon enough.</p>

<p>He further shared some words of advice for the young one, who he is sure will take a good look at himself and realize what his parents mean to him, &rdquo;He&rsquo;s desperate to forge his own way, and I respect that from Brooklyn. It&rsquo;s such a good thing to do. But remember where you came from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting things into perspective, he made sure the photographer aspirant was aware that his parents don&rsquo;t have all the time in the world and that the &lsquo;penny&rsquo; with his wife Nicola will surely drop one day, &rdquo;You&rsquo;re half mum, half dad. And you&rsquo;re an amazing young man. But, boy, they&rsquo;ve done more for you than anyone did in your entire life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreover, he shared that the footballer is seeking ways to solve the family issue, &rdquo;Time&rsquo;s going to be the best healer, and David will absolutely get that relationship back on track.&rdquo; Brooklyn has yet to speak directly about these remarks as of now.</p>

Longtime friends, the F1 racer has been around the TV star from the early 2010s, when she was still dating and then got married to Kanye West, with whom he used to be friends. After the two were reportedly recently seen taking a vacation together, the driver has shared his first thoughts on the dating rumors, neither confirming nor denying it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton reacts to rumors of dating Kim Kardashian for the first time</strong></p>

<p>Many are curious about <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/lewis-hamilton-and-kim-kardashians-relationship-timeline-from-dear-friends-to-rumored-lovers-1400421">Kim Kardashian and Lewis Hamilton</a>&rsquo;s developing romance, especially after they were spotted in a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-lewis-hamilton-and-kim-kardashian-just-confirm-their-romance-super-bowl-lx-appearance-raises-eyebrows-1400574">private box at the latest Super Bowl LX show</a> following their UK and Paris getaways. However, the world got a brief notice of the same as Sky Sports F1&rsquo;s Ted Kravitz shared that on asking the seven-time world champion about his relationship with the mom-of-four and if he enjoyed his company more than the American football game, he was told, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my private life. I&rsquo;m not talking about that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accepting that the sportsman was never going to talk about his dating life, he decided to leave it at that. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s no real life footage of the same, as the conversation seemingly happened during a written press meet situation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton and Kim Kardashian have piqued the interest of pop culture and sports enthusiasts alike, who are eager to see where this goes. Reports earlier claimed that they&rsquo;re happy with each other&rsquo;s presence at the moment and seem to be keen to see what follows.</p>

<p>Previously, PEOPLE shared that he&rsquo;s the first guy the KUWTK star has taken seriously following her divorce from Kanye West. &quot;She always liked him,&quot; the insider added. &quot;She&#39;s excited about their romantic connection. He makes her feel safe, and she genuinely enjoys spending time with him,&quot; an insider shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fans also seemingly heard the British racer&rsquo;s voice during a recent social media update with Kim&rsquo;s sisters.</p>

NFL Star’s Podcast Update Raises Suspicion on Wedding Date]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/2143888735_travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift.webp"></img><p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the biggest couple in Tinseltown is gearing up for a big wedding. After announcing their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-announce-engagement-after-2-years-of-dating-english-teacher-and-gym-teacher-are-getting-married-1396136">engagement in August 2025</a>, there have been multiple rumors surrounding their nuptials, including the possible venue and the marriage date. While nothing has been confirmed by the stars themselves, it appears that the fans have figured out that the wedding could very well be sometime soon. They&rsquo;ve managed to piece together hints from the break time taken by the Kelce brothers&rsquo; podcast and her other commitments to share that the ceremony date is near.</p>

<p><strong>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce&rsquo;s marriage may be dawning upon us, and here&rsquo;s why Swifties think so</strong></p>

<p>Recently, the New Heights podcast, run by Travis Kelce himself with his brother Jason Kelce, announced that it would be undergoing a one and a half month break. While the reason for the same was not confirmed in the announcement, they added that the hosts would be back to share their conversations with more people, anticipating a star-studded lineup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later, a fan successfully seeded doubt in other Swifties&rsquo; minds with the post, &ldquo;WATCH OUT! Travis &amp; Jason Kelce&rsquo;s podcast New Heights is taking a 6-week break. Speculation rises that his wedding with Taylor Swift is happening in this period.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The couple has mostly been private about their affairs, and so far, no details concerning their wedding have been revealed to the world. During an appearance on the Graham Norton show, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/where-did-taylor-swift-live-with-travis-kelce-post-eras-tours-conclusion-singer-unveils-renovation-plans-for-usd-1-7-million-rhode-island-manor-1367596">Taylor Swift</a> hinted at a long guest list and then went on to cast everyone present on the sofa with her in the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/why-is-taylor-swift-not-releasing-opalite-music-video-on-youtube-first-find-out-when-and-where-to-watch-1400478">Opalite music video</a>. Many have guessed that it was a reflection of her big day plans, where anyone who has crossed paths with the singer will be invited.</p>

<p>However, a source previously revealed to PEOPLE that the duo wishes for an intimate affair instead, sharing, &ldquo;It will definitely be a private affair and not a spectacle. They both have a close circle of friends, and they&rsquo;ll respect their privacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reports of a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-taylor-swift-getting-married-to-travis-kelce-in-rhode-island-on-june-13-2026-heres-what-we-know-1398952">June 13 wedding in Rhode Island</a> have been floating on the internet, but there have not been any updates on that as of now.</p>

The singer and the supermodel are known to have been dating since late 2015. Their on-and-off relationship finally ended in 2021, with the two reportedly going their separate ways after an altercation involving the model&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp;Many years later, the former <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-zayn-malik-face-discrimination-while-in-one-direction-new-lyrics-spark-diss-rumors-against-former-teammates-1393032">One Direction</a> member is opening up about his feelings, sharing that he may have never been in love after all.</p>

<p><strong>Zayn Malik is thankful to Gigi Hadid for bringing their daughter into this world, but draws the line at actually loving her</strong></p>

<p>During an appearance on the Alex Cooper podcast Call Her Daddy on February 11, the Die For Me singer shared his thoughts on his relationship with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/gigi-hadid-and-bradley-cooper-give-first-ever-joint-interview-on-street-take-it-day-by-day-1398961">Gigi Hadid</a>. While talking about his dating life, he said to the host, &ldquo;To be fair, just to have this on the record, I will always love G, because she is the reason my child is on this Earth, and I have the utmost respect for her. I will always love her, but I don&rsquo;t know if I was in love with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to reiterate that he does have admiration for her but is not sure if it was ever the romantic kind: &ldquo;I do love her a crazy amount, but no, I don&rsquo;t think I was in love with her at that point.&rdquo; The Dusk Till Dawn (featuring Sia) hitmaker explained that his behavior around his former partner led him to believe that it was never romance between them, adding, &ldquo;Otherwise I would have been a better version of myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sharing that his understanding of love is &lsquo;always developing,&rsquo; and while he means no disrespect to his past relationships, he thought it was love at the time, only to grow up and realize it wasn&rsquo;t, &ldquo;Maybe it was lust. Maybe it was this, maybe it was that. I don&rsquo;t feel like it was love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duo shares a 5-year-old daughter named <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/everything-you-need-to-know-about-zayn-malik-and-gigi-hadids-daughter-khai-1295734">Khai</a>&nbsp;between them that they&rsquo;re now co-parenting.

Meanwhile, the model has since moved on with Bradley Cooper, with whom she&rsquo;s been linked since 2023.</p>

<br />
<strong>F1 Movie Sequel Confirmed</strong><br />
<br />
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed that work has already begun on the next chapter. Speaking to PEOPLE recently at an event, the veteran filmmaker shared an exciting update about the follow-up to the 2025 blockbuster. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on the story. It&rsquo;s really good.

<strong>About the film F1</strong><br />
<br />
The first installment saw Hayes as he partnered with rising driver Joshua Pearce, played by Damson Idris, under the leadership of team owner Rub&eacute;n Cervantes, portrayed by Javier Bardem. A major highlight of the production was its immersive filming approach, with scenes shot during real Grand Prix weekends across multiple international circuits, making the film as realistic as possible.

<p><strong>Halle Berry is aware of the feeling when you&rsquo;ve found your person after being married 3 times previously&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Opening up about why she chose to be with Van Hunt and decided to get married after six years of dating, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/happy-birthday-halle-berry-exploring-her-10-greatest-roles-as-actress-turns-58-1338864">Halle Berry</a> went the romantic route by calling him the &lsquo;right&rsquo; man for her.

The 50-year-old has managed to engage in precautions following the passing of her mother in 2007. Speaking to French Inter, the star opened up on having and loving the scars she gained following the double surgery she got done over a decade ago. She shared that she was very interested in people who have scars and the life they carry within them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Angelina Jolie shares her thoughts on &lsquo;scars,&rsquo; adding meaning to her life</strong></p>

<p>Her double mastectomy in 2013 came about after learning that she carries the BRCA1 gene (Breast Cancer Gene 1). The actress decided to go for it, deciding it to be the best decision for herself. &quot;I&#39;m not drawn to some perfect idea of a life that has no scars. So no, I think, hey, you know, I see my scars are a choice I made to do what I could do to stay here as long as I could with my children,&quot; the actress shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saying that she loved her scars, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/beauty/skincare/skin-routine-to-follow-for-effortless-beauty-like-angelina-jolie-4-ultimate-tips-to-glow-maleficent-ly-1396829">Angelina Jolie</a>&nbsp;added that it allowed her to do &lsquo;something&rsquo; proactive about her health. The same became especially important for her, who lost her mother when she was young and has been raising her children without the presence of her grandmother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saying that &lsquo;this is life,&rsquo; she shared that it was important to people to have scars. &ldquo;If you get to the end of your life and you haven&#39;t made [a big, you know], you haven&#39;t made mistakes, you haven&#39;t made a mess, you don&#39;t have scars, you haven&#39;t lived a full enough life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had previously opened up about her chances of developing breast cancer being reduced from 87 percent to 5 percent. The actress has also had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to reduce the possibility of getting ovarian cancer.</p>

Following whispers of an alleged rift, things spiralled as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/amid-brooklyn-beckhams-controlling-parents-claims-past-clip-pulling-wife-nicola-peltz-into-family-pic-surfaces-watch-1400090">Brooklyn</a> went on a 6-page rant against his family, and especially his parents, David and Victoria. Now, Marc Anthony, a family friend and a guest at the oldest son&rsquo;s wedding to Nicola Peltz, has opened up about what&rsquo;s going on behind the scenes, and he claims it&rsquo;s not as ugly as it seems.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Beckham&rsquo;s dispute against family called &lsquo;extremely unfortunate&rsquo;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Marc Anthony is touching upon the entire situation with the Beckham folks and their son, Brooklyn, as the one being at the wedding and seemingly calling up on Victoria Beckham for a highly &lsquo;inappropriate&rsquo; dance on her son, or so the chef aspirant claims. The singer was sure of not adding fuel to the fire and called the Beckhams a &lsquo;wonderful family&rsquo; in a chat with The Hollywood Reporter. As for his situation with the kids? He recalled knowing them from before they were even born, owing to his friendship with the Spice Girl and the former footballer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m godfather to Cruz. I&rsquo;m really close to the family,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t seem ready to talk about what exactly went down at the wedding ceremony: &ldquo;I have nothing to say about what happened there.&rdquo; But he can say one thing for sure, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely unfortunate how it&rsquo;s playing out &mdash; but [how it&rsquo;s playing out] is hardly the truth.&rdquo; So far, the narrative seems to be that Brooklyn, frustrated with the &lsquo;controlling&rsquo; nature of his parents and the chaos around his nuptials, has denounced himself from the Beckhams with no plans of reconciliation. He has accused his family of trying to wedge a problem between him and his partner.</p>

<p>The situation has seemingly further escalated as the photographer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-beckham-is-devastated-as-son-brooklyn-covers-up-dad-tattoo-amid-family-feud-feels-like-a-deep-cut-1400516">covered up his tattoo</a> reading &lsquo;DAD&rsquo; in response to the ongoing feud. Previously, father <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-beckham-breaks-silence-over-son-brooklyns-controlling-parents-note-it-can-be-dangerous-1400082">David</a> had termed the whole happening as a &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; from his son&rsquo;s end.</p>

The 13-minute show of events from the star was a star-studded affair in its true sense as he brought on multiple famous celebrity friends to join him on stage. This included fellow singers, rappers, influencers, socialists, actors, and more taking to the Super Bowl LX Halftime Show as millions watched.</p>

<p>Kicking off his set at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, with a grand entrance singing Tit&iacute; Me Pregunt&oacute;, he followed it up with his other hit track Yo Perreo Sola, where Cardi B was seen. Among his famed backup dancers were none other than Jessica Alba, Alix Earle, Karol G, and Pedro Pascal, who kept the tension alive, featuring briefly during the performance. Fellow Puerto Rican rapper Young Miko was among the blingy appearances, as was friend and businessman David Grutman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the celebrities so far only appeared while dancing or hyping up the performance. However, the crowd was ready for more as Lady Gaga made a grand entry to sing a new rendition of her popular song Die With A Smile. She engaged in some salsa with Bad Bunny before he continued with more surprises. Next was Ricky Martin, who sang a new version of Bad Bunny&rsquo;s song, Lo Que Le Pas&oacute; a Hawaiʻi.</p>

<p><strong>Celebrities spotted at the Super Bowl LX game&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Puerto Rican star celebrated his culture throughout his 13-minute performance at the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks, which was finally won by the latter in a 29-13 victory. Many global celebrities were spotted in attendance, including Kim Kardashian and Lewis Hamilton, Jay Z (with Blue Ivy Carter), Adam Sandler, Travis Kelce (sans Taylor Swift), Justin Bieber and wife Hailey Bieber, Travis Scott, Keke Palmer, Emma Roberts, Kevin Costner, Jon Bon Jovi, Chris Pratt, Kendall Jenner, 21 Savage, Tracy Morgan, Kehlani, Becky G, Machine Gun Kelly, Daniel Radcliffe, Rob Lowe, Russell Wilson, Ciara and J Balvin.</p>

The two were previously seen together on multiple occasions, owing to their common high-end circle of friends and the F1 racer&rsquo;s friendship with her ex-husband Kanye West. Now it seems that they are ready to hard launch their romance to the world! The duo was seen in the stands at the Super Bowl LX game on February 8.</p>

<p><strong>Lewis Hamilton and Kim Kardashian share sweet times together at Super Bowl LX</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/home-decor/inside-kim-kardashians-luxe-closet-where-boots-and-bags-get-vip-treatment-1390911">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/who-has-lewis-hamilton-dated-a-look-at-everyone-hes-been-linked-to-from-rihanna-to-kendall-jenner-1393868">Lewis Hamilton</a> seem to be ready to announce to the world that they&rsquo;re dating shortly after their romance was made public during a secret UK getaway. On Sunday, the two were spotted in the audience at Levi&#39;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. As the cameras spun around, they were able to capture the duo lost in conversation. While the lenses did not capture an outright romantic moment, it was visible that the two were deeply attentive to each other throughout the night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The international broadcast of the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks became the love playground for the socialite and the driver. While the two have long been involved and spotted together at events, their relationship seems to have developed recently. &ldquo;Kim and Lewis have such intense working schedules, so they&rsquo;re keen to spend as much time together as possible,&rdquo; a source shared with the US Sun. The two were quoted as being &lsquo;inseparable,&rsquo; with the Formula 1 star planning his life around her work commitments, as per insiders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They are said to have enjoyed themselves at the luxury Estelle Manor country club in Oxfordshire, England. Following a short stay at the Rosewood Hotel in London, they hopped to Paris for a brief stay before seemingly heading to California, USA, for Super Bowl LX. The final game was special this time around for its Halftime Show, led by the first Puerto Rican singer to do so, as <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/sports-life/bad-bunnys-super-bowl-lx-halftime-performance-when-and-where-to-watch-grammy-winner-amid-patriots-vs-seahawks-game-1400544">Bad Bunny</a> took to the stage later in the night.</p>

Here's what we know]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/1985148596_fotojet-2026-02-08t115606-501-converted-from-jpg.webp"></img><p>Speculation surrounding Zendaya and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/why-tom-holland-and-zendayas-wedding-is-getting-delayed-even-when-spider-man-actor-is-ready-to-elope-heres-what-we-know-1390135">Tom Holland</a> has once again taken over social media, with fresh rumors claiming the actress is expecting her first child with her fianc&eacute;. The chatter was reignited after a social media post alleged that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-tom-holland-blend-romance-and-work-with-london-walk-and-indian-lunch-on-spider-man-set-1395388">Zendaya</a> was pregnant, prompting widespread discussion online. However, the account clearly identifies itself as a parody page and is not affiliated with verified entertainment news handles, immediately casting doubt on the claim.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rumors around Zendaya&#39;s pregnancy</strong><br />
<br />
Despite the viral traction, there has been no credible confirmation from the couple or their teams. The rumor mill gained momentum as recent photos of Zendaya, interpreting her clothing choices as signs of a pregnancy. This isn&rsquo;t the first time Zendaya has been subjected to pregnancy speculation. Similar rumors have surfaced multiple times over the past few years, usually triggered by viral images or public outings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On one such occasion, Zendaya&rsquo;s mother, Claire Stoermer, firmly shut down the claims, urging people to rely on better sources. Many fans and online commentators have repeatedly labelled this speculation intrusive, noting that oversized outfits, winter layers, or awkward angles are frequently misinterpreted on social media. There have been no reports of delays or changes linked to pregnancy or wedding plans. While Zendaya and Tom Holland are officially engaged, reports indicate they are taking their time with wedding plans, prioritizing privacy and their demanding work schedules.<br />
<br />
<strong>Zendaya&#39;s work front</strong><br />
<br />
Professionally, Zendaya is now busy with her upcoming romantic comedy film, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zendaya-and-robert-pattinson-engaged-first-look-at-their-sparkling-romance-in-the-drama-1399039">The Drama</a> opposite Robert Pattinson. She remains attached to several major projects, including Euphoria Season 3, Dune: Part Three, The Odyssey, and Spider-Man: Brand New Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neither Zendaya nor Tom Holland has addressed the recent rumors, and their representatives have made no statements supporting the claims. For now, the pregnancy speculation appears to be another case of social media-driven misinformation, with no factual basis to support it.</p>

<p>While fearing that she was &quot;never getting married again, never gonna have kids,&quot; she spoke about feeling terrible and unable to continue with her day. &quot;I knew when I was lying on that floor in my house, I thought, &#39;Oh my God, this is what they talk about.

The family, known for having multiple tattoos, dedicating their love to each other, seems to have lost one as the firstborn has decided to cover up his ink, reading &lsquo;Dad&rsquo;. As per Daily Mirror, the former footballer is &quot;utterly devastated&quot; at his oldest&rsquo;s decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>David Beckham feels heartbroken over son&rsquo;s decision to get heartfelt ink covered up</strong></p>

<p>Brooklyn Beckham has gotten rid of a once-permanent mark of his filial love, a tattoo of an anchor meant to indicate his love for his father on his right bicep. It is believed that Brooklyn Beckham has also altered his Love you Buster tattoo, which was also a nod to his father&rsquo;s nickname for him. And while the arm ink has been spotted with a change as the photographer and his wife took a stroll ahead of the weekend, the latter is yet to be confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sun quoted a source saying, &ldquo;Brooklyn&rsquo;s had laser treatment on the writing. He wanted it gone.&rdquo; The aspiring chef is said to have been deeply hurt by his family&rsquo;s behavior. &ldquo;There is so much hurt and pain on his side, it would not be genuine to keep such a tribute on his body,&rdquo; the insider added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, a separate source has shared with Metro what the 50-year-old thinks of his son&rsquo;s latest laser treatment: &ldquo;David is obviously heartbroken over Brooklyn&rsquo;s decision to cover up his tribute to him. It feels like a deep cut, even after everything that was said in his statement.&quot;</p>

<p>This move comes after the ex-Manchester United captain called his son&rsquo;s 6-page-long <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckham-says-no-to-reconciliation-with-family-accuses-mom-victoria-of-calling-him-evil-endless-attacks-1400055">Instagram story rant</a> a &lsquo;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-beckham-breaks-silence-over-son-brooklyns-controlling-parents-note-it-can-be-dangerous-1400082">mistake</a>&rsquo; and decided not to comment further. He decided to let his son continue as he likes. David Beckham also carries multiple tattoos related to his kids, with the most famous one being for his oldest, reading &lsquo;Buster&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brooklyn Beckham also has an eagle tattoo on his left wrist, much like his father, which he is said to have gotten in 2017. He previously also seemingly covered up &lsquo;mama&rsquo;s boy&rsquo; ink, which was a nod to his mother&rsquo;s Spice Girl roots. He is known to have an arm tattoo reading &lsquo;mum&rsquo; within a heart beside some flowers, which is also said to have been covered up last year.</p>

Grammys Producer Says Boxer Fit Was Undecided]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/962339011_justin-bieber-and-hailey-bieber.webp"></img><p>Justin Bieber reignited the fever of his performances after singing Yukon from his latest album SWAG at the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/grammys-2026-steven-spielberg-grabs-egot-status-with-music-by-john-williams-kendrick-lamar-beats-jay-zs-record-1400391">2026 Grammy Awards</a>. While he and his wife, Hailey Bieber, coordinated their <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/grammys-2026-justin-bieber-hailey-bieber-go-matching-at-red-carpet-miley-cyrus-and-fiance-maxx-morando-sabrina-carpenter-rock-power-looks-1400389">all-black fits</a> on the red carpet and posed lovingly for the cameras, the singer opted for a risqu&eacute; option while taking to the stage soon after, where he seemingly debuted new <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-justin-bieber-get-wife-hailey-biebers-face-tattooed-singer-debuts-new-back-ink-during-shirtless-grammys-performance-1400395">back ink of his partner&rsquo;s face</a>. It seems that the star had not decided his fit until the very last moment, as per producer Ben Winston.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Justin Bieber&rsquo;s new tattoo appears to have been a belated call</strong></p>

<p>Speaking on the Rolling Stone Music Now podcast, Grammy Awards producer Ben Winston shared what it was like to have Justin Bieber return to the show after missing it for four years. He spoke about the chill vibe of the Canadian pop star, including his last-minute decision to get on stage, where he ended up flashing a brand new tattoo, seemingly of Hailey Bieber&rsquo;s 2020 magazine shoot. &quot;I don&rsquo;t think he decided what the outfit would be until he walked on stage,&quot; revealed the 44-year-old.</p>

<p>The moment went big on social media for Justin Bieber&rsquo;s shirtless look as he performed one song with live vocals while only wearing a pair of custom satin boxers and some socks on his feet. While the singer himself is yet to comment on the possible new back ink he has of his wife, the online chatter has been on for quite some time now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opening up about how the Baby hitmaker took only 15 minutes out of his allotted 90-minute rehearsal slot, Ben Winston shared, &ldquo;He&#39;s not even really going, &#39;This is what I&#39;m going to do. When we had got reached out to him about his creative, he was just like, I&#39;m just going to get on stage and sing.&quot; (sic)</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the father of one walked away empty-handed at the Grammys ceremony despite being up for four wins. He previously had two awards to his name, Best Country Duo/Group Performance for 10,000 Hours and Best Dance Recording for Where Are &Uuml; Now.</p>

Find Out When and Where to Watch ]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-02/2041571447_taylor-swift.webp"></img><p>Life of a Showgirl is not over, nowhere near it, actually, it seems, and the mastermind behind it all, Taylor Swift, has pulled another golden bell moment. On February 4 local time, a countdown on her website showcased an upcoming music video for her popular track off of her twelfth studio album, Opalite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Life of a Showgirl gets its second music video with the Opalite release</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/blackpinks-rose-reveals-how-taylor-swift-helped-plan-going-solo-and-label-signing-she-pulled-me-aside-1400311">Taylor Swift</a> has confirmed the release of the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/taylor-swift-sets-october-release-for-the-life-of-a-showgirl-album-featuring-sabrina-carpenter-track-list-and-cover-revealed-1395586">Opalite</a> music video. However, one detail did not go unnoticed by her fans, as it said that the clip would drop only on Apple Music and Spotify Premium. Normally, Taylor Swift and almost all of the music world would release their music videos on YouTube, mainly because it would translate into monetary gains, but also because it would count towards streaming data that would make the artists chart on music lists worldwide.</p>

<p>With the recent update from Billboard announcing that YouTube would no longer be involved in its charting systems, the songstress seems to have chosen a more effective way to get herself some more streams and surely a higher spot on the charts.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the singer is aiming for a change in how music videos are consumed around the world. However, that in no way diminishes the importance of the platform, as after it drops exclusively on Apple Music and Spotify Premium on Friday, February 6, at 8 a.m. ET, the music video will be available on those platforms for a couple of days until February 8 at 8 a.m. ET, when it will be released on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with this announcement, Taylor Swift has officially launched a new Opalite blue pearlescent vinyl on her website, the pre-orders for which are on till February 6 at 7 p.m ET or until supplies last. The song initially debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and continues to be a strong placeholder for the album, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/the-life-of-a-showgirl-taylor-swifts-album-set-to-dominate-music-charts-know-release-time-in-india-and-us-1397383">Life of a Showgirl</a>,&nbsp;with its latest ranking of 10. The single follows The Fate of Ophelia, which was the album&#39;s top-ranking track at its October 2025 release.</p>

But thankfully, the warrior that their daughter is, Malti fought every day for the next months and slowly started to gain some weight. “After six blood transfusions, she was doing great.

One party that has stayed silent so far is the billionaire Peltz family, who seems not to want to involve themselves in the Beckhams&rsquo; business. The actress&rsquo;s father, Nelson Peltz, was recently asked to comment on the ongoing public row, and he reacted with a mostly similar take about wanting to keep his personal life private. However, he also expressed his support to his daughter and son-in-law, showing just whose side he is on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nelson Peltz reacts to Brooklyn Beckham&rsquo;s rant against his mum and dad, accusing them of &lsquo;controlling&rsquo; his life</strong></p>

<p>As reported by TMZ, the 83-year-old was chatting with the media at a Q&amp;A session at the WSJ Invest Live event in West Palm Beach, Florida,&nbsp;when he was asked about his daughter&rsquo;s in-laws. Sharing a brief response, he expressed his wish to keep all things confidential, &quot;My advice is to stay the h-ll out of the press.&quot; The businessman has rarely made his family life public and has stuck to his work and building an empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also showcased how he has a funny bone amid all the mess by saying, &quot;Has my family been in the press lately? I haven&#39;t noticed at all.&quot; While this does not indicate that things have smoothed over for the bunch, it shows that Nelson Peltz will not make things public, unlike his son-in-law,&nbsp;Brooklyn Beckham, who shared a lengthy 6-page note alleging his family of trying to drive a wedge between him and his wife, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/amid-brooklyn-beckhams-controlling-parents-claims-past-clip-pulling-wife-nicola-peltz-into-family-pic-surfaces-watch-1400090">Nicola Peltz</a>, and denouncing any plans to reconcile with them.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the powerful investor shared his continued support for his &lsquo;great&rsquo; child and her partner, wishing them to have a &quot;long, happy marriage together.&quot; The same emotion was not shared by David Beckham, who <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-beckham-breaks-silence-over-son-brooklyns-controlling-parents-note-it-can-be-dangerous-1400082">reacted to the controversy</a> by saying that his kid was making a &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; and wanted to let him do so. Spice Girl Victoria is yet to pass any comment on the fiasco, choosing the high road instead.&nbsp;</p>

The two who crossed paths on the set of Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy as Meredith Grey and Mark Sloan, remained pals even as his character met an end in 2012, while she has continued to appear on the show as a regular for multiple more years. Speaking at the ALS Network Champions for Cures &amp; Care Gala via a pre-recorded message, as shared by PEOPLE, the actress recalled reaching out to him on learning about his diagnosis back in April 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Eric Dane&rsquo;s ALS diagnosis had Ellen Pompeo immediately offer help</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/ellen-pompeo-recalls-uncomfortable-sx-scene-in-greys-anatomy-and-why-she-wanted-equal-pay-in-your-worst-nightmare-1378245">Ellen Pompeo</a> is opening up about the talk she had with <a href="http://ment/hollywood/eric-dane-wishes-als-diagnosis-is-not-the-end-of-my-story-promises-hes-capable-of-more-1391338">Eric Dane</a> after he revealed that he was suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) back in early 2025. She recalled the very moment she decided to reach out, &ldquo;As soon as I heard about his diagnosis, I texted him, and I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m here if you want to speak. And my phone rang 30 seconds later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 56-year-old promised her dear friend that she would help him with &quot;whatever you need, however I can help. I love you.&quot; In the message, she shared a personal note to the fellow on-screen doctor, &quot;I&rsquo;m really proud of you. I love you so much, and I am honored to get to speak about you today.&quot;</p>

<p>While neither Pompeo nor Dane was present in person at the event, with the latter having to cancel shortly before it began owing to his health, they connected via the video message displayed on the screen. The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-ellen-pompeos-hulu-show-good-american-family-based-on-a-true-story-all-we-know-about-natalia-graces-adoption-1378403">Good American Family</a> star went on to revisit their first meeting as two young actors on the set of the Shonda Rhimes show and how he made her feel, &nbsp;&quot;I remember when he came in as McSteamy and us having instant electric chemistry, and I immediately just fell in love with him.&quot; The 53-year-old played the skilled plastic surgeon from 2002 to 2012, after which his character only appeared in a cameo in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

With a guitar in his hand, he showed raw emotion while performing in front of the attendees of the awards night. While he did not take home any wins himself, the singer was there following the strong fan response to his two albums, SWAG and SWAG II, both of which dropped last year as surprise releases and shook the music charts globally. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This back tat is not the first one he has to boast his unending love for his wife, with a H22 wrist ink previously seen during an Instagram livestream. The number holds special significance to the Canadian star, with Hailey Bieber&#39;s birthday on November 22 and their son&rsquo;s birth date being August 22.&nbsp;</p>

Grabbing himself a Grammy Award for his contribution to Music by John Williams, he ensured that his name would be etched in Emmys, Grammys, Oscars,&nbsp;and Tonys history.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Steven Spielberg is officially an EGOT winner</strong></p>

<p>A complete EGOT was successfully acquired by American filmmaker, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/updates/what-did-jurassic-park-director-steven-spielberg-say-to-kareena-kapoor-when-he-saw-her-in-a-restaurant-actress-recalls-unexpected-encounter-1385569">Steven Spielberg</a>, with the latest addition of a Grammy Award during the ceremony held on Sunday local time in Los Angeles. Being awarded the Best Music Film win for Music by John Williams, in which he contributed as a producer, the 79-year-old made a big day for himself without even attending the ceremony. He joins the highly coveted list of EGOT achievers, including Mel Brooks, Whoopi Goldberg, Viola Davis, John Legend, Jennifer Hudson, Elton John and more. There have only been 21 EGOT winners in history, making it an extremely special win for the director.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kendrick Lamar overcomes Jay Z&rsquo;s record for most honored rapper at the Grammys</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, another historical achievement was made by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-when-kendrick-lamar-talked-about-his-biggest-vice-amid-his-rising-stardom-1359600">Kendrick Lamar</a>, who ensured his visit to the Peacock theater this time around was no regular feat. Accepting the Best Rap Album for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/kendrick-lamar-surprises-his-fans-with-new-album-gnx-learn-here-1359556">GNX</a>, Best Rap Song for tv off, Best Melodic Rap Performance for luther (with SZA), and Best Rap Performance for his feature on Chains &amp; Whips, at this year&#39;s ceremony, he is officially the most awarded rapper in history, surpassing Jay Z.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The older star has 25 wins to his name; meanwhile, the Not Like Us hitmaker has written his name on 26 already&nbsp;(Update: he made it 27 by the end of the night). He entered the ceremony with 22 to his credit and won&nbsp;an impressive four right off the bat. He could very well add to his quarter-century record by the end of the night, having been up for a total of eight wins at this year&rsquo;s event. Kendrick Lamar and Jay Z have previously collaborated on a remix of B-tch, Don&#39;t Kill My Vibe, which was released in 2013. &nbsp;</p>

In an interview with Cosmopolitan, she&rsquo;s opened up about why she &lsquo;never talked about&rsquo; her dating life, and a lot of it has to do with the public nature of her job.</p>

<p><strong>Anyone But You actress Sydney Sweeney reveals how the dating scene has treated her since her last breakup</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/the-white-lotus-actress-sydney-sweeney-offered-bollywood-film-worth-rs-530-crore-know-everything-about-her-role-1396942">Sydney Sweeney</a> has had a big year, and starting off 2026 with the excitement of the next season of Euphoria has worked quite in her favor. Not one to talk much about her personal life, the actress, when asked about her relationship and subsequent separation from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/sydney-sweeney-speaks-out-about-being-single-for-first-time-since-jonathan-davino-split-learning-a-lot-1390255">Jonathan Davino</a>, revealed that she always thought &lsquo;it&rsquo;s important to have some things for myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aware of the constant, numerous sets of eyes that are on her, she continued, &ldquo;I understand that I&rsquo;m a public person, but I&rsquo;m still in my 20s. I&rsquo;m still figuring out love, and it&rsquo;s hard to do that with millions of people who have their own opinions of what that looks like.&rdquo; Shedding light on how it has been to get into the dating scene following her split from the 42-year-old businessman, she said, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard deciding that I want to experience love in the public eye. I&rsquo;m just navigating it all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And although she struggles to be alone, she&rsquo;s determined. &ldquo;I wake up, and I find out I&rsquo;m dating a different guy anytime I stand in a room where there&rsquo;s a single man,&rdquo; she added. After some time of keeping to herself and a few crying sessions, she&rsquo;s trying her best to get out there and meet someone new, but it&rsquo;s not easy. &quot;I&rsquo;ve never dated before. I&rsquo;ve never even used a dating app.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sydney Sweeney is all set to appear in The Devil Wears Prada 2 with a cameo and make a return as Cassie Howard in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/sydney-sweeney-spills-beans-on-how-things-change-for-cassie-in-unhinged-euphoria-season-3-she-is-crazy-1389380">Euphoria season 3</a>.</p>

This time it&#39;s probably what no one had expected (or hoped). <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-zayn-malik-face-discrimination-while-in-one-direction-new-lyrics-spark-diss-rumors-against-former-teammates-1393032">Zayn Malik</a> seems to have spoken up at a recent gig, in thanking his fans for their presence, and at the same time, what can presumably be seen as a dig towards his former friend, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zoe-kravitz-sparks-engagement-rumors-with-harry-styles-after-stepping-out-wearing-eye-catching-gold-ring-1399329">Harry Styles</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zayn Malik comments on Harry Styles&rsquo; expensive tour tickets? All we know</strong></p>

<p>Performing in front of a large crowd, Zayn Malik appeared for a night full of singing at the Dolby Live at Park MGM, as a part of his seven-night residency at the venue. On Wednesday night, local time, he took to the mic to perform some of his biggest hits. However, soon after, he dropped a comment that has now become the center of attention. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s from Vegas? Who&rsquo;s from elsewhere?&rdquo; and as fans answered, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to them. &ldquo;I just want to say a big, big thank you to each and every single one of you for being here with me tonight. You could&rsquo;ve been anywhere, [but] you decided to spend your night with me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His next words have caused uproar within the fandom and online: &ldquo;Hopefully the ticket prices weren&rsquo;t too high &ndash; just saying!&rdquo; His seemingly lighthearted comment, made with a smile and without any follow-up remarks, has now found itself to be the centerpiece of chatter online. Many are wondering whether it was indeed a sly dig at his former bandmate, Harry Styles, who recently announced his new album, as well as a tour, Together, Together. The tickets of which have been a rare finding, and the prices are sky-high.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the pre-sales going live this week, fans of the singer have taken to social media to voice out their frustration over the unbelievably high-priced tickets, and yet the shows are all sold out. Many claim that scalpers have had their fill with hiked resales, observing triple or more on the price tag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zayn Malik&rsquo;s remark comes in the midst of all the online discourse over the price, and while he did not personally mention a name, the timing of it has everyone convinced that it was indeed a dig. &nbsp;</p>

Having re-released her music after re-recording it and acquiring her masters back, she has been the most successful in the scene. The songstress has been vocal about being available to help others win their own battles, and one person who has shared how her advice came at a great time in their life is <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-rose-becomes-first-female-k-pop-soloist-to-enter-billboard-radio-songs-top-10-with-bruno-mars-collab-apt-1365374">BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Ros&eacute;</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Ros&eacute; reveals Taylor Swift took her aside to help with music advice</strong></p>

<p>After seven years with YG Entertainment, Ros&eacute; was out the door with her solo music on her mind. While her group activities continued to be under the same label, she was looking out for a new home, which she eventually found in The Black Label, a subsidiary of the Big 3 Korean media giant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During her appearance on Alex Cooper&rsquo;s Call Her Daddy podcast, the singer once again shared how the Blank Space hitmaker helped her out with understanding the ins and outs of having your music to your own name. &quot;That was when I was trying to look for a label and everything. But before that I was learning about how to protect myself, what does everything mean,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opening up about where they met and how the conversation came to be, she added, &ldquo;I&#39;m grateful enough to have met her along the way at a party that I was invited to. She was so nice. We were chatting and I explained why I was out in the U.S. Then I was like, &#39;Oh, I was kinda struggling with this.&#39; She&#39;s like, &#39;Ask me anything,&#39; and she pulled me aside.&quot;</p>

<p>Artist to artist, the two seem to have opened up as the 36-year-old shared her wisdom, honed over many years of working in the business. One of the most loved and celebrated pop stars of this century, Taylor Swift, aided Ros&eacute; during her transition from a K-pop group member to a soloist. The BLACKPINK member has since dropped a new album named Rosie, gained worldwide fame over <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-rose-quotes-therapist-after-apts-historic-song-of-the-year-win-at-2025-vmas-not-giving-up-1396567">APT.</a> with Bruno Mars, and become a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-rose-and-katseye-react-to-grammy-nominations-with-screams-and-tears-cannot-believe-my-life-1398312">three-time nominee</a> for the upcoming Grammy Awards.</p>

The family feud became a public spectacle when last week the young one <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckham-says-no-to-reconciliation-with-family-accuses-mom-victoria-of-calling-him-evil-endless-attacks-1400055">spoke out against his parents</a> in a series of notes shared on his social media account. Following this, many have been wondering whether the Beckhams will ever be fully together again, and a source has revealed that the couple wants billionaire heiress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/amid-brooklyn-beckhams-controlling-parents-claims-past-clip-pulling-wife-nicola-peltz-into-family-pic-surfaces-watch-1400090">Nicola Peltz</a> away from their son if they were to ever take him back.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Source reveals possibility of Beckhams reuniting with son</strong></p>

<p>After the &ldquo;David and Victoria love Brooklyn and are afraid of losing their son. They would take him back in a minute,&rdquo; a source shared with PEOPLE on Tuesday. A separate source revealed that although the couple wishes to reconvene as a family, they need their daughter-in-law to take a step back from the narrative and they&#39;re firm on this demand from their oldest, &ldquo;The Beckhams have no intention of reconciling with their son unless Nicola is out of the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The madly in love duo tied the knot in 2022 which is where the problems seemingly got out of proportion. Amid all the mess, the insider close to the matter clarified, Brooklyn Beckham is unlikely to listen to his parents&rsquo; wants, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not an ultimatum he&rsquo;s going to cave on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously, the 26-year-old shared a lengthy 6-page rant against his family, especially his folks, blaming them for trying to build a wedge between him and his wife, Nicola Peltz. Additionally, he shared that his mother made his then-wife-to-be&rsquo;s life difficult by canceling the making of her bridal dress &lsquo;at the 11th hour&rsquo;. The family seems to have fought about multiple things during the wedding planning process, including their seating and their decision to have their grandmothers at the same table as the then-newlywed couple at the ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

Amid all this, she did not receive a Grammy nod as the record was released just outside of the consideration period however reports of her possibly performing at the award show surfaced which the executive producer has now clarified, calling it baseless.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>No Taylor Swift at this year&rsquo;s Grammys and here&#39;s why</strong></p>

The award show has called out HITS Daily for reporting that she may be dancing at the front row, however after it was picked up globally as a possibility, Ben Winston shared that it was all but a speculation. &ldquo;The only reason people think Taylor might be performing or coming is because HITS decided to print it this week and put it in their HITS List, and it was picked up globally,&rdquo; he clarified where the rumor first came from. &ldquo;But HITS just totally made that up. And now I am getting asked about it by you, as if it&rsquo;s a real thing, when it was made up in your office! That really is a full-circle rumor!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The songstress hasn&rsquo;t been announced as a performer or presenter. Previously, Entertainment Tonight reported a source regarding an update on the star, &ldquo;Taylor&rsquo;s happy, grounded, and fully focused on her life with Travis. Right now, she&rsquo;s prioritizing everything positive and exciting happening in her life.&rdquo; She seems to be deep in planning mode for her lavish wedding expected to happen this mid-year after announcing her engagement back in August 2025. The sportsman popped the question in the backyard of his private estate in Leawood, Kansas. The two have been together since 2023 in a very public love story following Swift&rsquo;s breakup from 6-year boyfriend Joe Alwyn and rumored brief relationship with Matty Healy.&nbsp;</p>

She is still processing the breakup since it was a very serious relationship,&quot; they added, sharing an update on her mindset post the split. ⁠ &nbsp;</p>

<p>Bella Hadid and Adan Banuelos were first linked back in October 2023 when they were spotted together on a date in Texas. A couple of months later, they went Instagram official, with a loved-up photo of themselves celebrating her 27th birthday.

The two have repeatedly spoken about their unmatched camaraderie while filming and recently during an interview with Vogue, the actress shared how her co-star managed to catch her off guard with a room full of roses on the set of Wuthering Heights the film. Their chemistry for the erotic reimagination has managed to surprise audiences and keep them on their toes for the upcoming release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wuthering Heights star Margot Robbie reveals how she commemorated Valentine&#39;s Day last year<br />
Margot Robbie has not shied away from praising Jacob Elordi for his very generous gestures and being a great co-star while filming for the romance drama movie. Recently, she revealed that their February 14 celebration last year was no small feat as he managed a beautiful surprise. She shared, &ldquo;You made my day and, as Heathcliff, filled my room with roses and it was so cute&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her impression of her co-star was nothing less than marvelous as she imagined if this is how he behaves with a fellow actor, how nice would he be to his own partner, &ldquo;I remember thinking, oh he&rsquo;s probably a very good boyfriend. It wasn&rsquo;t just the gesture of the roses, it was the thing written from Heathcliff, and that little tombstone thing.&rdquo; The younger actor seems to have added some personal details to his surprise, one that connected him to his character of Heathcliff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, in another interview, the Barbie actress shared that the absence of her on-screen partner made her anxious to the point that she would search for him at every possible moment when they were away from each other. The internet has not taken lightly to their remarks, impressed with their immersion in their roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wuthering Heights is all set to release internationally on February 11, followed by the United States premiere on February 13. With these dates, it appears that the two would once again spend the upcoming Valentine&#39;s Day together, promoting their film.</p>

DJ Fat Tony, who was present at the lavish affair, appeared on This Morning to reveal what exactly went down. He shared how it was the Beckhams&#39; friend Marc Anthony who called Victoria the &lsquo;most beautiful woman in the room&rsquo; amid the groom&rsquo;s claims of her hijacking his first dance with his wife and making it &lsquo;humiliating&rsquo; for him.</p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz&rsquo;s wedding DJ shares account of Victoria&rsquo;s &lsquo;inappropriate&rsquo; dance with her son</strong></p>

<p>DJ Fat Tony spoke to the show&#39;s hosts on Friday, detailing the events of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/has-brooklyn-beckham-become-puppet-to-nicola-peltz-report-claims-he-does-everything-his-wife-says-1387334">Brooklyn Beckham</a> and Nicola Peltz&rsquo;s wedding. He shed light on how, more than making any inappropriate dance moves, it was the timing of Victoria Beckham&rsquo;s entrance on the stage that caused uproar. &ldquo;I said it was inappropriate as well, because it was the timing.&rdquo; He went on to share how Marc Anthony&rsquo;s performance became the playground for issues, as when the groom was standing on stage and everyone was expecting the bride to be called on, but instead it was his mother who joined him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that point, Brooklyn is literally, like, devastated because he thought he was going to do his first dance with his wife, then Nicola leaves the room crying her eyes out,&rdquo; he added. Showing his support for the oldest Beckham child, he further said, &ldquo;Brooklyn is stuck there on stage, and they do this dance, and Marc Anthony says &lsquo;put your hands on your mother&#39;s hips&rsquo; and it was a Latin thing, and the whole situation was really awkward for everyone in the room&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>DJ Fat Tony and his husband, Stavros Agapiou, have previously shared similar confirmations of the 26-year-old&rsquo;s accusations aimed at his parents as eyewitnesses at the ceremony. The 60-year-old&rsquo;s remarks come a few days after Brooklyn Beckham&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckham-says-no-to-reconciliation-with-family-accuses-mom-victoria-of-calling-him-evil-endless-attacks-1400055">6-page-long Instagram update</a>, where he spoke about the ongoing feud between him and his parents and the issues that happened during his wedding planning and on the day of the ceremony.&nbsp;</p>

Actor Secretly Meets Denis Villeneuve: Report]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/278017191_jacob-elordi.webp"></img><p>The hunt for the next James Bond is on, but maybe not for much longer! With actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Anthony Boyle, Callum Turner, Leo Suter, Harris Dickinson, Reg&eacute;-Jean Page, and Idris Elba being named in the running, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/jacob-elordi-bags-first-major-acting-win-at-critics-choice-awards-for-frankenstein-i-really-didnt-plan-for-it-1399653">Jacob Elordi</a> has now seemingly had advanced talks with the creators for the role of 007. As per a ShowBiz report on January 23, the star met up with Denis Villeneuve, and this could more or less mean that a role may be confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>The James Bond franchise seems to be eyeing a new lead, Jacob Elordi</strong></p>

<p>Jacob Elordi earned his first-ever Oscar nomination for his portrayal of The Creature in Netflix&rsquo;s Frankenstein. He is up for the Best Supporting Actor win at the Academy Awards alongside Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro in One Battle After Another, Delroy Lindo in Sinners, and Stellan Skarsgard in Sentimental Value. Not only is it his debut nod, but it is also an acknowledgement of his refreshing career. And the actor seems more than ready to take on another iconic role in the form of James Bond, previously essayed by Daniel Craig.</p>

<p>As per recent reports, the 28-year-old has had extensive meetings with director Denis Villeneuve and the film&rsquo;s producers. As such, it appears that they may have reached a conclusion on the casting in the role of the famed spy in Amazon&rsquo;s upcoming reboot. If this comes true, on the heels of his Oscars nom, Jacob Elordi may get ready for another celebration soon.</p>

<p>Earlier reports have pitted <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/accusations-of-aaron-taylor-johnsons-mistreatment-of-co-actor-resurface-amid-james-bond-rumors-hated-them-1398095">Aaron Taylor-Johnson</a> and Callum Turner as two other strong contenders for the character, so take all information with a grain of salt. Apart from the director, Peaky Blinders fame writer Steven Knight has been handed over the script authority. Other details remain under wraps as of now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jacob Elordi is known for his work in The Kissing Booth and Euphoria, alongside his other projects, including Saltburn and Priscilla. He will next be seen in the erotic romance drama, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/wuthering-heights-first-look-emerald-fennells-erotic-adaptation-with-margot-robbie-and-jacob-elordi-eyes-valentines-day-2026-release-1396427">Wuthering Heights</a>, with Margot Robbie.&nbsp;</p>

In attendance were a few of their industry friends, including Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Paul Rudd, and her <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/only-murders-in-the-building-season-5-hulu-release-date-cast-plot-and-where-to-watch-1396609">Only Murders in the Building</a> co-stars Martin Short and Steve Martin. Detailing how his unsuspecting mistake left a big mark on the couple&rsquo;s big day, Martin Short shared that the wedding cake had to take an irreversible blow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Martin Short details when he cut Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco&rsquo;s wedding cake before the couple</strong></p>

<p>Appearing on the latest episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the 75-year-old comedian and actor recalled the moment it all went down. Recalling the beautiful wedding reception, where he sat with Paul Rudd and his wife Julie, the star said he ended up cutting through a cake with a knife that was near that table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Expecting it to be a dessert item per table, he decided to give a piece to his co-actor Steve Martin, who was about to leave, only to have everyone scream at him. He shared, &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh Steve, you can&rsquo;t leave&rsquo; &mdash; I had a fork in my hand. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t leave yet without a piece of wedding cake.&rsquo; And I cut the wedding cake, one side, and cut the other.&rdquo; He even seemingly tried to fix it with a fork, which only made it worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After learning that it was indeed the wedding cake that the couple was supposed to cut into, he got ready to take his leave and warned everyone not to inform the bride, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-wears-custom-ralph-lauren-wedding-outfit-benny-blanco-turns-heads-in-classic-tuxedo-1397256">Selena Gomez</a>, until at least a month after the day. Speaking about how the correctional work was eventually done, he said, &ldquo;They called the wedding coordinator, and then the chef came out.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Then they did surgery, but it ended up being like a Hollywood wedding cake, and it was beautiful, but now it had a little work done,&quot; he added. Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco have remained tight-lipped about the whole ordeal so far.&nbsp;</p>

Many users online have begun taking sides, with a few claiming Nicola Peltz is unwilling to be a part of the family and is reluctant to stand to the side. Meanwhile, a different bunch is claiming that Victoria Beckham&rsquo;s cold shoulder towards her daughter-in-law is unacceptable and unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The resurfaced video is only adding fuel to the raging fire between Brooklyn Beckham and his parents, who he claims have directed the narrative and tried to build a wedge in his relationship with his wife.

So when their eldest, Brooklyn, goes around claiming that they tried to control his life and push a brand image, the world eats it up. A day after the 26-year-old shared a lengthy six-page note on his Instagram stories, denouncing his parents and choosing the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckham-says-no-to-reconciliation-with-family-accuses-mom-victoria-of-calling-him-evil-endless-attacks-1400055">no-reconciliation</a> route with them, his father, David, has responded. He called the young one&rsquo;s words a &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; but also supported him by saying that children are allowed to do so, while advocating for the effects of social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>David Beckham shares thoughts on son Brooklyn Beckham&rsquo;s tell-all notes</strong></p>

<p>Appearing on CNBC&rsquo;s financial talk show Squawk Box, the former footballer addressed his son <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-brooklyn-beckham-tell-his-family-he-wants-no-contact-refuses-to-respond-to-messages-amid-growing-feud-1391189">Brooklyn Beckham</a>&rsquo;s remarks, alleging that the Beckham family tried to ruin his relationship with his now-wife <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/has-brooklyn-beckham-become-puppet-to-nicola-peltz-report-claims-he-does-everything-his-wife-says-1387334">Nicola Peltz</a> even before their marriage. He reacted to the social media rant with, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always spoken about social media and the power of social media, for the good and for the bad. The bad, we&rsquo;ve talked about, what kids can access these days, and it can be dangerous. But what I&rsquo;ve found personally, especially with my kids as well, use it for the right reasons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to shed light on his own attempts via UNICEF to spread awareness regarding matters of the children. Keeping his comment generic, sans the name of Brooklyn or any of his three other kids, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper Seven, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to do the same with my children, to educate them [about social media]. They make mistakes. Children are allowed to make mistakes. That&rsquo;s how they learn. So, that&rsquo;s what I try to teach my kids.&rdquo; He ended his take on the fiasco with, &ldquo;You have to sometimes let them make those mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his note, Brooklyn Beckham accused his mother of canceling on making his bride&rsquo;s dress in the 11th hour, arguing over seating arrangements at the wedding, and feeling &lsquo;humiliated&rsquo; over her highly inappropriate dance that she &lsquo;hijacked&rsquo; from the couple.</p>

The Manchild singer has been linked to multiple people following her breakup with the Irish actor; however, the latest rumors have everyone holding their breath in hope that it&rsquo;s true this time around. On January 18, the songstress was spotted entering the after-party of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/saturday-night-star-finn-wolfhard-reflects-on-what-his-dream-snl-gig-would-look-like-i-think-it-would-be-fun-to-1353266">Finn Wolfhard&rsquo;s Saturday Night Live</a> appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sabrina Carpenter flames Joe Keery dating rumors with Stranger Things event attendance</strong></p>

<p>Finn Wolfhard made his SNL hosting debut this past weekend. To celebrate the same, a party was held for him and his friends. Among the many attendees, onlookers were quick to spot Joe Keery and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/blackpinks-jump-overtakes-sabrina-carpenters-manchild-becomes-biggest-2025-spotify-debut-for-female-artist-and-k-pop-act-1393738">Sabrina Carpenter</a> entering the venue. Albeit they came separately, fans became instantly aware of their past relationship rumors, which quickly got reignited.</p>

<p>Photos from the event showcase them dressed in party fits as they waved to the flurry of cameras snapping away at the Espresso hitmaker and the Upside Down frequenter. Other fellow Stranger Things stars included Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin, who were also present at the party.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/all-of-joe-keerys-movies-and-tv-shows-1295619">Joe Keery</a> and Sabrina Carpenter first got linked back in October 2025, during Sabrina Carpenter&rsquo;s Short n&rsquo; Sweet Tour stop in Texas as a part of the Austin City Limits music festival, the singer jokingly apprehended him with her iconic fuzzy pink handcuffs. Soon, clips from the event went viral, with many putting two and two together, hoping they&rsquo;d actually be dating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two have each been linked to many people in the past, with rare confirmations coming from them. Joe Keery has previously only admitted to being in a relationship with Maika Monroe; meanwhile, Sabrina Carpenter has been romantically involved with Bradley Steven Perry, Griffin Gluck, Barry Keoghan, and Shawn Mendes. Other rumors include those with Joshua Bassett and Dylan O&#39;Brien.</p>

<p>So far, neither of the two stars has commented on the dating speculations that have been following them for a while now, but they have not done anything to deter them either. In fact, their recent sightings have only fueled the talks.</p>

Months after hearsay and questions surrounding his relationship with his superstar parents, football legend <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/inside-the-beckhams-ongoing-feud-brooklyn-beckham-breaks-silence-on-bond-with-dad-david-amid-family-rift-1387121">David Beckham</a> and fashion designer Victoria Beckham, he shared a lengthy note on his Instagram story, calling out their alleged actions. The oldest of the lot has accused his folks of trying to ruin his relationship with his now-wife, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/has-brooklyn-beckham-become-puppet-to-nicola-peltz-report-claims-he-does-everything-his-wife-says-1387334">Nicola Peltz</a>. He started off by sharing his firm decision on the matter and standing up for himself, &ldquo;I do not want to reconcile with my family.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Brooklyn Beckham lashes out at parents, David and Victoria Beckham, over wedding chaos</strong></p>

<p>The 26-year-old took to his social media handle to pen a detailed account of the happenings at his wedding, including the moment he recalls his mother hijacking his dance with his wife, &ldquo;She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone,&rdquo; adding that he &ldquo;never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.&rdquo; He further added how the pressure for the wedding began much in advance, accusing his mother of canceling the making of the bride&rsquo;s dress &lsquo;in the 11th hour&rsquo;, which had Nicola Peltz being forced to &lsquo;urgently find a new dress&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wedding planning was marred with other issues, including the seating arrangement, claims the 26-year-old, &ldquo;My mum went so far as to call me &lsquo;evil&rsquo; because Nicola and I chose to include my Nanny Sandra, and Nicola&rsquo;s Nanny at our table, because they both didn&rsquo;t have their husbands.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-brooklyn-beckham-tell-his-family-he-wants-no-contact-refuses-to-respond-to-messages-amid-growing-feud-1391189">Brooklyn Beckham</a> shared how standing up to his family resulted in retaliation in the form of a directed media narrative: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve received endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dissuaded the claims that it was his partner who had been controlling him and instead laid the blame on his parents for planning his life even at the expense of his professional commitments, &ldquo;My family values public promotion and endorsements above all else. Brand Beckham comes first. Family &lsquo;love&rsquo; is decided by how much you post on social media, or how quickly you drop everything to show up and pose for a family photo opp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Beckham kids include his two brothers Romeo and Cruz, as well as his sister Harper Seven.</p>

All About Dakota Johnson’s 28-Year-Old Rumored Singer Boyfriend Post Chris Martin Breakup]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/1663493186_role-model-dakota-johnson.webp"></img><p>Dakota Johnson and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-dakota-johnson-break-up-with-chris-martin-because-he-wouldnt-set-wedding-date-source-claims-1391200">Chris Martin</a> were in a long and loving relationship for 8 years, so when the reports of their alleged breakup surfaced, it left the show business in shock. Since the revelation, which neither of them has personally addressed so far, keen eyes have followed the two at every event, observing for possible new romances. It seems that the 36-year-old actress may have moved on already with American singer, Role Model.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Role Model?</strong></p>

<p>Real name Tucker Harrington Pillsbury, the 28-year-old singer-songwriter and rapper is making a name for himself in the music industry. After debuting an album back in 2017, he has been steadily rising. With a couple of more albums under his belt since, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/dakota-johnson-spotted-on-cozy-dinner-date-with-role-model-fuels-dating-rumors-1399496">Role Model</a> was known to be previously dating Emma Chamberlain, the influencer, host, podcaster, businesswoman, and model, from 2020 to 2023. It is believed that his homesickness for Maine, away from the busy life of Los Angeles, made them grow apart and eventually led to a breakup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is set to make his acting debut in Netflix production and Lena Dunham&#39;s directorial rom-com Good S-x, starring Natalie Portman and Mark Ruffalo. The rom-com film is all set to come out in 2027, where Role Model will play the character of Caleb and has been listed under his real name, Tucker Pillsbury.</p>

<p><strong>How did Dakota Johnson and Role Model&rsquo;s relationship rumors begin?</strong></p>

<p>It is known that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/dakota-johnson-calls-working-with-chris-evans-and-pedro-pascal-on-celine-songs-materialists-magical-time-1388428">Dakota Johnson</a> and Role Model were first spotted on a date back in December 2025. Their sighting together grabbed multiple eyeballs, and fans began to question whether they were dating. This past week, the Fifty Shades of Grey actor and the younger singer were spotted on another outing in Los Angeles on Wednesday, as per a clip obtained by Deuxmoi. Their December dinner was said to have been a candlelight affair with friends, but the latest appearance together was more intimate with matching black outfits.</p>

<p>Neither of the two stars has admitted or denied, or even commented on their hangout sessions so far.</p>

Appearing at a special screening of the younger one&rsquo;s sports movie Marty Supreme in Los Angeles on January 14 local time, the two stars showed how they believe in healthy competition. Speaking about coining a term for the theatrical clash of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/robert-downey-jr-to-assemble-avengers-and-fantastic-four-against-x-men-avengers-doomsdays-alan-cumming-accidentally-drops-major-spoiler-1387238">Avengers: Doomsday</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/timothee-chalamet-zendayas-dune-3-confirms-official-title-and-its-not-dune-messiah-shuts-down-another-rumor-1393248">Dune: Part 3</a>, they publicly confirmed that they&rsquo;re in support of calling it &lsquo;Dunesday.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Dunesday comes into play as RDJ and Chalamet announce a joint term</strong></p>

<p>According to a DEADLINE report, on Wednesday, the two actors sat down in LA to speak to a room full of people, where they addressed the highly talked-about clash between the two films. They seemed unbothered at first glance, but anyone can tell it&rsquo;s a matter of concern on both sides, with major multiplexes possibly facing a similar dilemma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing to keep it aside instead and poking fun at having the same release dates, the Iron Man star showed how they saw the light side of things and said, &nbsp;&ldquo;We both have films opening on December 18, and we decided to coin it&hellip; We&rsquo;re thinking Dunesday.&rdquo; As the audience members managed to respond with a chuckle, he added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if we&rsquo;re still friends by then,&rdquo; motioning to the Wonka actor in front of him, who smiled as well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just the two stars but the whole world that is watching whether another box office takeover, much like what was seen back in 2023 when the Margot Robbie-led film Barbie and the Cillian Murphy starrer Oppenheimer premiered on the same day, July 21. The clash only egged on viewers of both films to compete fiercely at the box office, allowing an even higher performance than anyone probably expected.</p>

<p>The two films managed to earn a whopping combined 2.5 billion USD worldwide. Similar bets are on for the awaited face-off between Avengers: Doomsday and Dune: Part 3 on December 18, 2026, just in time for the Christmas holidays.</p>

A new reaction from him has revealed how, despite not paying much attention to it, he would read about it occasionally. &ldquo;There was a time where BTS, they just like got to their peak, kind of they&rsquo;re still there, but when they&rsquo;re on the way up and I felt like every time I logged into Twitter, they&rsquo;d just taken one of our like, like some record for the fastest-selling thing, and they&rsquo;re taking it, and I just felt like every week, I just saw a new thing taken away from (by) BTS.&quot;</p>

It looks like the professional athletes haven&#39;t stopped reaching out to Sweeney, something which reportedly doesn&#39;t sit well with Braun. According to The Sun, the music mogul finds the persistent messages &lsquo;incredibly disrespectful,&rsquo; particularly because his relationship with Sweeney is known.</p>

<p>However, the two have very different philosophies when it comes to personal space. While Braun is said to be struggling with the lack of boundaries from the outsiders, Sweeney isn&#39;t bothered. &ldquo;Sydney has always been fiercely independent,&rdquo; a source told the outlet. &ldquo;She values time alone, whether that&rsquo;s traveling by herself, going out with girlfriends, or just switching off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This has created a bit of a tug-of-war in their dynamic, as the source added that &ldquo;Scooter prefers togetherness, and he&rsquo;s still adjusting to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sweeney is a frequent guest at Dodgers, Lakers, and Nets games. Despite her presence in the stands, she has been vocal in the past about her dating preferences, once noting that she is far more interested in businessmen than the athletes on the court.</p>

<p>For now, neither Sweeney nor Braun has addressed the rumors directly. Sydney is currently busy with the promotions of her new film, The Housemaid, while Braun is immersed in his various music and business ventures. While they may be keeping things low-key to avoid the chatter, the couple seems to be moving forward at their own pace.</p>

<p>As Alex breaks up with his longtime girlfriend, Sarah, and finally admits to himself that Poppy may have been one of the reasons it never worked out with her, he wishes to be with his best friend. After the two meet at his brother David&rsquo;s wedding and confess their undying love, they end up in an argument about how their totally different lifestyles may never be in favor of their relationship, and go their separate ways. She says a globetrotting life awaits her, while he wishes to settle down and build a family. They&rsquo;re at odds, and neither is ready to give up.</p>

<p>Poppy&rsquo;s unexpected encounter with Sarah helps clear her mind about her relationship with Alex and makes her realize that, despite saying that she never wanted a permanent address, she always disliked the despair of somehow always being alone. Finally, she decides that her feelings for Alex are far bigger than she ever imagined and goes on to chase him, demanding that they get together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two plan a future together, and the film ends with them staying at a place of their own in New York, where they each pursue their dreams. They see the bigger picture and think of the other person in their relationship while also trying to be as true to themselves as possible.</p>

Earlier reports suggest that Avengers star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-scarlett-johansson-joining-tangled-live-action-find-out-as-film-talks-proceed-at-disney-1397606">Scarlett Johansson</a> was roped in for the role of the adoptive mother figure in the story, with no confirmations coming in as of now.</p>

<p>The original movie had Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi voice the parts of the damsel in distress, princess-to-be, and the thief who saves her from the claws of the evil Mother Gothel. It is believed to be a long-term project, with Disney unlikely to rush its production after the extensive time it took to choose its leads. No further details have so far been revealed, including a possible premiere date.</p>

There have been talks going around about how the Duffer brothers may have left intentional hints for the fans of the show to figure out and whether a new episode was indeed shot but never revealed to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, neither Netflix nor the creators of the show have commented on all the fan theories, leaving the narrative be that episode 8 was the official to the 10-year run of Stranger Things. Continuation plans of the series have already been announced, with a spin-off live-action already in production, and a documentary called One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things Season 5 is all set to drop on January 12.</p>

The stand-up comedian first tied the knot to her chef beau back in 2018. While previously <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/amy-schumer-announces-divorce-from-husband-chris-fischer-after-seven-years-of-marriage-1399106">announcing their separation</a> back in December 2025, the two did not share plans for any divorce at the time, however it seems that they have now decided to go the legal way, with the actress choosing to file for divorce from her farmer husband, as reported by PEOPLE first.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Amy Schumer files for divorce from Chris Fischer&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It is known that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-to-when-amy-schumer-brutally-mocked-blake-livelys-interview-persona-as-actress-faces-legal-battle-against-justin-baldoni-1366769">Amy Schumer</a> chose to go official with the divorce by filing for the papers on Tuesday, January 6, according to the New York County court records. The duo shared their decision to go their separate ways with a note from the 44-year-old actress on her Instagram account. She wrote, &quot;Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after 7 years,&quot; she wrote at the time. &quot;We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son. We would appreciate people respecting our privacy at this time.&quot;</p>

<p>Back then, she confirmed that it was &quot;amicable and all love and respect! Family forever,&quot; between the two of them. She also joked about the situation, sharing that their decision was not because she &ldquo;dropped some lbs and thought I could bag [a] basket and not because he&rsquo;s a hot Janlmes [sic] beard award winning chef who can still pull some hot tail,&rdquo; seeing the positive in the case instead.</p>

<p>Previously, sources close to the couple have confirmed to the media that their decision is &lsquo;cohesive&rsquo; and not the aftereffect of something &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; going down. In the past, they have swatted away any rumors of a split with funny Instagram updates, including a moment when she confidently declared, &lsquo;Chris and I are still married&rsquo; back in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amy Schumer and Chris Fischer share a son, Gene, aged 6.</p>

Creator Comments]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2026-01/1892178227_emily-in-paris.webp"></img><p>Previously, as per Netflix, during a press conference back in December, series creator Darren Star shared, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of places I&rsquo;d love to visit. But I think the show organically [follows] the storyline. The show is Emily in Paris. It&rsquo;s never going to permanently leave its home base. But if I can take the audience on a journey somewhere else, I would love that&hellip; [It&rsquo;s] fun to think about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the last season, which became Emily in Rome for a while, the lead star strutted around Italy with her new boyfriend Marcello Muratori (Eugenio Franceschini). But at the end of the 10 episodes, a grand fashion event later, she has been brought back to Paris, and her long-lost love Chef Gabriel (Lucas Bravo) has sent a letter inviting her to Greece.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether the show takes off in a new city with a renewed passion between Emily and Gabriel, or if she goes back to Rome to stay with her most recent boyfriend, Marcello, who has offered to welcome her to his fashion house, Muratori, alongside a quiet life in Solitano. Meanwhile, her best friend Mindy (Ashley Park) has accepted Nicolas de L&eacute;on&#39;s (Paul Forman) proposal while harboring feelings for Emily&rsquo;s ex, Alfie (Lucien Laviscount), with whom she has had a fling.</p>

The 28-year-old actor earned the honor for his portrayal of the Creature in Guillermo del Toro&rsquo;s highly anticipated adaptation of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/andrew-garfield-admits-he-was-disappointed-to-lose-out-on-frankenstein-role-but-meeting-jacob-elordi-changed-his-mind-1362432">Frankenstein</a>, making this his first major acting award. Taking the stage at the Barker Hangar, Elordi appeared visibly surprised by the win. Opening his speech, he admitted he had not prepared remarks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elordi started his acceptance speech as, &ldquo;Bloody hell. I really didn&#39;t plan for it.&rdquo; The actor went on to thank production designer Tamara Deverell, costume designer Kate Hawley and prosthetics makeup effects department head Mike Hill. He said, &ldquo;You guys are geniuses. I couldn&#39;t walk around like this in front of a green screen. You guys made that world. So thank you.&rdquo; The actor also recognized director Guillermo del Toro for inspiring him since he was a kid. &ldquo;I love you. We all love you. You made my dreams when I was 11. I&#39;m so happy to be here,&rdquo; he continued, later adding, &ldquo;and thank you, Mom and Dad. Cheers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In del Toro&rsquo;s reimagining of Mary Shelley&rsquo;s classic novel, Elordi plays Victor Frankenstein&rsquo;s ill-fated creation, portrayed opposite Oscar Isaac. The role charts the Creature&rsquo;s emotional evolution from innocent curiosity to tragic rage as he navigates rejection and cruelty from humanity. Elordi has previously described the character as deeply personal, stating that the performance allowed him to channel his own life experiences into what he considers his most honest work to date.</p>

<p>The role was also physically demanding. Del Toro had earlier mentioned that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/euphoria-star-jacob-elordi-reportedly-parts-ways-with-olivia-jade-giannulli-after-4-years-of-relationship-1395281">Jacob Elordi</a> spent nearly 10 hours each day undergoing extensive prosthetic application involving dozens of makeup pieces. Despite the grueling process, the director praised the actor&rsquo;s patience and dedication, calling the final performance emotionally raw and profoundly moving.</p>

<p>Elordi&rsquo;s win came against a formidable lineup of nominees, including Benicio del Toro, Paul Mescal, Sean Penn, Adam Sandler, and Stellan Skarsg&aring;rd. Adding to his awards-season momentum, the actor is also nominated at the upcoming 2026 Golden Globe Awards, set to take place on January 11, further cementing his rise as one of his generation&rsquo;s most compelling performers.</p>

The 27-year-old was spotted locking lips with his new lady love, Bruna Marquezine, in Brazil. As reported by TMZ, the two were snapped together taking a dip in the waters off the coast of Algagoas and going for some hardcore PDA. While not publicly addressing their relationship so far, their recent sightings have more than confirmed the status.</p>

<p><strong>Shawn Mendes smooches&nbsp;Bruna Marquezine&nbsp;during Brazil vacay</strong></p>

<p>Bruna Marquezine, the Brazilian model, actress, and filmmaker, has found her new love in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/we-just-need-a-little-bit-more-time-shawn-mendes-postpones-fifth-album-release-while-unvealing-new-concert-film-1353062">Shawn Mendes</a>. After previously being spotted together on multiple occasions, the two went off to a beach in Algagoas, engaging in public displays of affection. According to reports, they were photographed smooching at the beach.</p>

<p>This is not the first time that the two have taken to raising the temperatures in the room, but it is certainly the most fortifying moment. Previously, TMZ also reported their Rio de Janeiro escapade, alongside being spotted enjoying a quiet dinner date and jetting off to a vacation in South America. They tried to avoid the cameras as much as possible and appeared to want to keep their relationship mostly private for the time being.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Shawn Mendes&#39; past relationships and rumored dating spells</strong></p>

<p>After an on-again, off-again dating era spanning four years with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/were-camila-cabello-and-shawn-mendes-spotted-together-at-copa-america-game-in-florida-find-out-1328188">Camila Cabello</a>, which lasted from 2019 to 2023, the star was mostly keeping it to himself, or so everyone thought. Shawn Mendes&nbsp;was linked to the chiropractor Jocelyne Miranda in 2023, following his breakup with fellow Se&ntilde;orita singer. His other popular rumored ex-girlfriend includes pop star <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-camila-cabellos-latest-post-a-dig-at-sabrina-carpenter-find-out-1343402">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, with whom he was also linked during his &lsquo;break&rsquo; from the former Fifth Harmony member. Later, in 2024-25, there were rumors surrounding his relationship with Helena Gualinga, a climate activist; however, nothing seemingly came of their common interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, his strongest reported romance remains with model and entrepreneur, Hailey Baldwin, who he was supposedly seeing during 2017 and 2018. Their many public appearances, including the Met Gala, remain fan favorites.</p>

<p>Since his high-profile divorce from Gisele B&uuml;ndchen, Brady has kept his personal life relatively low-key. While Gisele has moved on&mdash;marrying Joaquim Valente in December and recently welcoming their first child together&mdash;<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/are-tom-brady-and-sofia-vergara-dating-everything-we-know-about-their-relationship-status-1393435">Tom has been linked </a>to names like Irina Shayk and Brooks Nader.</p>

<p>Regarding his casual summer connection with Nader, an insider previously mentioned: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been hooking up this summer, having rendezvous in different cities. It&rsquo;s casual. She has a very active social calendar and likes to party, and Tom is often with the kids and doesn&rsquo;t like the nightlife scene.&quot;</p>

<p>Whether his night out with Alix Earle in St. Barths was a one-time celebration or something more, it&rsquo;s certainly the most talked-about moment of the new year.</p>

While the exact timeline of their relationship remains unknown, it is believed that the two dated for a couple of years before they got engaged earlier last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Este Haim and Jonathan Levin&rsquo;s wedding</strong></p>

<p>The couple reportedly got married in California in a very private wedding on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Prior to the ceremony, the then-bride-to-be took a trip to Paris in November, where she and her sisters, Danielle and Alana, took to the Louis Vuitton atelier and shopped for the main event, reception, after-party, and bridesmaid dresses.</p>

<p>Among the many esteemed guests at the super intimate wedding, best friend Taylor Swift and legend Stevie Nicks were spotted walking beside each other. The pop star donned a blingy gold dress and a matching scarf with her hair tied up and away from her face. She has previously worked with the Haim clan for No Body, No Crime and Gasoline, with the trio being the opening act for her Eras Tour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bride and the bride-to-be were recently spotted on a dinner date, early December, which many speculated to be a bridesmaid moment between the two. Taylor Swift, who is planning her own wedding this year after a dream August proposal from Travis Kelce, is said to be eyeing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/taylor-swift-and-gigi-hadids-friendship-timeline-how-did-they-become-friends-after-dating-joe-jonas-1299165">Gigi Hadid</a> and Selena Gomez in her bridal party.</p>

<p>After being introduced by a &lsquo;friend of a friend&rsquo; and going on a blind date, during which the two went to Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, New York, they were inseparable. The 39-year-old then announced their engagement via a public post made ahead of Valentine&rsquo;s Day 2025, where she showed off a big sparkler. They were mostly kept away from the cameras but were occasionally spotted alongside their famous friends, including Miss Swift, who would be at the American football suite <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/travis-kelce-seen-visiting-taylor-swifts-suite-looking-heartbroken-after-his-loss-at-2025-super-bowl-1371805">supporting her then-Kansas City Chiefs player boyfriend</a>.

<p>Hollywood veteran actor, Tommy Lee Jones&rsquo; daughter, Victoria Jones, has reportedly passed away after being found unresponsive at a hotel in San Francisco. According to reports, the incident occurred in the early hours of New Year&rsquo;s Day at the Fairmont San Francisco, a luxury property in the city. She was 34 years old.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the emergency responders were alerted to a medical situation at the hotel shortly before 3 a.m. The San Francisco Fire Department later confirmed that paramedics arrived at the location, assessed the individual, and pronounced her deceased at the scene. Authorities subsequently notified the San Francisco Police Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, who took over the investigation.</p>

<p>Police officials arrived at the hotel soon after the emergency call and investigation was initiated to determine the circumstances surrounding the demise. While the cause has not yet been disclosed, local reports have indicated that investigators do not suspect foul play this time. No further details have been released as inquiries remain ongoing.</p>

<p>Victoria Jones was the daughter of Academy Award-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones, 79, and his former wife, Kimberlea Cloughley. She is also survived by her older brother, Austin Jones. Though she largely remained out of the public eye in recent years, Victoria had early exposure to the entertainment industry and briefly pursued acting.</p>

<p>She appeared alongside her father in Men in Black II in 2002 and later featured in several projects released in 2005, including One Tree Hill, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and Sorry, Haters. In the past interviews, Tommy Lee Jones spoke proudly of his daughter&rsquo;s talent, highlighting her linguistic skills and dedication to her craft. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada held particular significance, as it was directed by Jones himself. Representatives for Tommy Lee Jones have not yet issued a public statement.</p>

What better way to end a great year than to get married to the love of your life? The 31-year-old can agree. As reports of the star&rsquo;s wedding began spreading around the internet, he took to his Instagram account, sharing a beautiful update with his new wife to his 5 million followers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Zach Bryan and Samantha Leonard get married in Spain</strong></p>

<p>Previously, a Back Grid video from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/i-wasnt-coming-for-zach-bryan-shares-this-about-choosing-kanye-west-over-taylor-swift-before-deleting-twitter-1349107">Zach Bryan</a> and Samantha Leonard&rsquo;s whirlwind wedding in Spain spread online, inciting intrigue from the fans of the star. Attendees and onlookers were surprised to see him carrying his newlywed wife to a car as the crowd cheered for them. The words &lsquo;Just Married&rsquo; were seen on their getaway vehicle, hinting at their sudden nuptials. The couple has reportedly only been dating for just about half a year after being linked in July 2025 for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after, the couple starred in a beautiful photo from their big day in the singer&rsquo;s social media update. He could be seen carrying his lady love bridal style as she smiled down at him with what seemed to be a glass of champagne in her hand. A follow-up video in the same post showed him performing in a suit. The caption read, &quot;Tougher than the rest,&quot; a nod to the Bruce Springsteen song that he was seen singing to in the clip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just a day before, the singer had shared a photo in black and white photo starring his friends, seemingly his groomsmen from the rehearsal dinner, as they held each other&rsquo;s waists for a fun snap. He added the words to the Black Eyed Peas track I Gotta Feeling in the caption, &quot;Tonight&rsquo;s the night, let&rsquo;s live it up/I got my money, let&rsquo;s spend it up (I feel)/Go out and smash it, like, &#39;Oh my God!&#39;/Jump off that sofa, let&rsquo;s kick it off (I feel).&rdquo;</p>

<p>This marriage comes a year after his split from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brianna-chickenfry-claims-ex-zach-bryan-offered-her-usd-12m-to-sign-an-nda-and-stay-quiet-about-their-relationship-1357357">Brianna &quot;Chickenfry&quot; LaPaglia</a> in October 2024.

<p>The final volume picks up immediately after the devastating cliffhanger of Volume 2, with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-5-ending-explained-was-vecna-defeated-all-about-elevens-choice-and-hawkins-future-1399551">Hawkins</a> standing on the brink of complete annihilation. The Upside Down has fully bled into the real world, and Vecna&rsquo;s endgame becomes terrifyingly clear. The story narrows its focus to concentrate on survival, sacrifice, and closure as the group prepares for one last stand.</p>

<p>What sets the plot apart is its emotional weight. Rather than relying solely on spectacle, the narrative leans into consequences as the decisions made in earlier seasons finally come full circle. The finale ties past and present together, rewarding long-time viewers with callbacks while pushing characters toward irreversible choices that define the end of their journey.</p>

<p><strong>What Works for Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 3</strong></p>

<p>The biggest strength of Volume 3 is its sense of finality. The pacing is deliberate, allowing moments to breathe even amid chaos. Each sequence feels purposeful, whether it&rsquo;s a quiet conversation or a large-scale confrontation. The stakes never feel artificial, making the tension genuine and gripping.</p>

<p>Another standout element is the emotional payoff. Relationships that have evolved over five seasons are given space to resolve naturally. Friendships, found family, and personal growth take center stage, reminding viewers why Stranger Things resonated beyond its sci-fi horror roots in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>What Does Not Work for Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 3</strong></p>

<p>Despite its strengths, the finale isn&rsquo;t without flaws. Some plot resolutions feel slightly rushed, particularly involving secondary characters whose arcs deserved more screen time. A few answers arrive quickly, making certain developments feel more convenient than earned.</p>

<p>Additionally, the sheer scale of the climax occasionally overshadows subtle storytelling. In trying to deliver a grand ending, the series leans heavily on spectacle, which may dilute the emotional impact for viewers who preferred the intimate, character-driven moments of earlier seasons.</p>

<p><strong>Acting Performances in Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 3</strong></p>

<p>The cast delivers some of their strongest performances in the series. Millie Bobby Brown brings raw vulnerability and resolve, anchoring the emotional core of the finale. Her portrayal reflects how much the character and the actor has grown since Season 1.</p>

<p>The supporting cast also shines. Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Sadie Sink, David Harbour each get moments to leave a lasting impression. Their performances feel lived-in and authentic, elevating even simple dialogue into emotional scenes that linger long after the episode ends.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict of Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 3</strong></p>

<p>As a conclusion, Volume 3, after a decent <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-5-episodes-1-4-review-millie-bobby-brown-owns-it-as-eleven-and-the-core-groups-final-battle-with-vecna-begins-1398744">Volume 1</a> and highly disappointing <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-vol-2-review-millie-bobby-browns-series-headed-toward-disappointment-just-like-game-of-thrones-1399440">Volume 2</a>,&nbsp;does deliver&nbsp;a slightly rushed but&nbsp;heartfelt farewell. It balances horror, nostalgia, and emotional closure while honoring the spirit of the show. It captures the essence of what made Stranger Things a cultural phenomenon.</p>

<p>The finale may not please everyone, but it feels sincere and earned. Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 3 closes the door on Hawkins with confidence, leaving behind a legacy that will continue to resonate with fans for years to come.</p>

It was Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), Jim Hopper (David Harbour), Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Eleven (<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-vol-2-review-millie-bobby-browns-series-headed-toward-disappointment-just-like-game-of-thrones-1399440">Millie Bobby Brown</a>), <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-5-volume-2-trailer-dustin-and-steve-face-doom-of-upside-down-ahead-of-christmas-day-drop-you-die-i-die-1399157">Dustin Henderson</a> (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton), Will Byers (Noah Schnapp), Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink), Steve Harrington (Joe Keery), Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke) and Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson) versus Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) aka One aka Henry. Here&#39;s what went down in the 3rd and last volume of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-volume-3-netflix-release-date-and-time-in-india-us-plus-what-to-expect-1399526">Stranger Things 5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Did Vecna survive the final battle?</strong><br />
An emotional farewell awaited the fans of the show as they were able to watch a final showdown of Dungeons and Dragons unfurling on the screen. Eleven, who was ready to give her life up for the safety of her friends and family, was able to do so, albeit at the cost of her own existence in the human world. As Henry faced his childhood self and looked back on his troubled past, Vecna was defeated by the gang of friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Joyce Byers and Jim Hopper find their happily ever after by sending off Will. She accepts his proposal and even manages to bid goodbye to her ex Bob (Sean Astin). Meanwhile, he finds himself returning to his position at the police station, with an offer for Montauk awaiting his attention.</p>

<p><strong>What happened to Mike and Eleven?</strong><br />
The biggest loss came to Mike, who saw the end of Vecna through to the last bit, but also dealt with the absence of Eleven&mdash; a debatable closure for the character. He wondered if, far away from Hawkins, she was able to survive while building a new life for herself, with the visuals of her passing being a mere last illusion from Kali. The creators of the show have neither confirmed nor denied the possibility of her being alive, leaving it to the viewers. However, the slight hope of her survival, supported by Mike&rsquo;s encouragement, is all that fans of the star needed.</p>

<p><strong>Where do the rest of the cast members go from here?</strong><br />
The Upside Down has been destroyed, while Mike has turned to writing for his career, choosing to chronicle the crazy life he has lived and beginning to tell his stories to the world. Dustin is the valedictorian of his class, 18 months into the future. Max and Lucas move out of the town and live together happily after a final date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve, Jonathan, Nancy, and Robin still meet up monthly to catch up despite going their separate ways. Steve is a baseball coach at the school, Robin attends Smith College in Massachusetts, Jonathan becomes a filmmaker studying at New York University, and Nancy drops out of Emerson College to work at the Boston Herald.</p>

<p>Will&rsquo;s big coming out moment leads him to New York, where he rediscovers himself and builds more confidence. Finally, Vecna and, thereby, Henry, meets a much-awaited end after being destroyed by the bunch in the final battle. The D&amp;D campaign is taken over by Holly (Nell Fisher), Derek, and their friends.&nbsp;</p>

However, Ares develops self-awareness, begins questioning his purpose, and ultimately sides with humanity after ENCOM successfully manifests a stable digital orange tree. This leads to a conflict over Ares&rsquo;s freedom and the code&rsquo;s potential to create life versus its use as a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Cast and crew of Tron: Ares</strong></p>

<p>Tron: Ares stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/9-women-accuse-jared-leto-of-sexual-misconduct-know-full-timeline-of-allegations-involving-underage-girls-1390917">Jared Leto</a> in the lead role as the titular character, Ares, an AI super-soldier.

<p>The film is directed by Joachim R&oslash;nning, with the screenplay written by Jesse Wigutow, who co-wrote the story with David DiGilio.

The two were photographed enjoying a candlelit dinner with friends, instantly sparking dating rumors. Images from the evening show the actress and the singer seated close to one another, appearing relaxed and comfortable in each other&rsquo;s company.</p>

While neither of them has commented publicly on the nature of their relationship, their chemistry during the outing has not gone unnoticed by fans.</p>

<p>The sighting comes months after <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/dakota-johnson-turns-to-revenge-dress-fashion-after-splitting-from-chris-martin-post-8-years-of-dating-1390815">Dakota</a> reportedly ended her long-term, on-again, off-again relationship with Coldplay lead vocalist <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-dakota-johnson-break-up-with-chris-martin-because-he-wouldnt-set-wedding-date-source-claims-1391200">Chris Martin</a>.

From superhero epics to ambitious sci-fi adaptations, these five films are among the most anticipated releases of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Avengers: Doomsday</strong><br />
Marvel&rsquo;s Avengers: Doomsday is expected to be one of the biggest cinematic events of 2026. Featuring an ensemble cast of MCU superheroes, the film is rumored to push the franchise into a darker, high-stakes phase. While plot details remain under wraps, the teaser broke the internet by showing the return of Captain America aka Steve Rogers played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/avengers-doomsday-teaser-a-new-hero-chris-evans-returns-as-steve-rogers-holding-a-newborn-to-release-on-dec-18-1399377">Chris Evans</a>.

<p><strong>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</strong><br />

Starring Tom Holland as Spider-Man, the film reportedly continues his story in a more grounded world after the events of No Way Home. Zendaya is also expected to return as MJ. The film is set to be directed by Destin Daniel Cretton.</p>

<p><strong>Street Fighter</strong><br />
The iconic video game franchise returns to the big screen with Street Fighter, a reboot aimed at redefining the series for modern audiences. Directed by Kitao Sakurai, the film is expected to blend martial arts action with stylized storytelling. While the full cast is yet to be officially announced, the film has generated strong buzz due to its attempt to include game&rsquo;s mythology, iconic characters, and fighting spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Dune: Part Three</strong><br />
Denis Villeneuve&rsquo;s Dune: Part Three will conclude the epic saga based on Frank Herbert&rsquo;s novels. Timoth&eacute;e Chalamet returns as Paul Atreides, alongside Zendaya, Florence Pugh, and other key cast members. The film is expected to delve deeper into the consequences of power, prophecy, and rebellion.

<p>Volume 2 of Stranger Things Season 5 pushes the story into its final, decisive stretch, focusing on consequences rather than build-up. Where Volume 1 largely set the stage, Volume 2 deals with fallout, emotional, physical, and moral. The Upside Down is no longer a distant threat but an ever-present force shaping Hawkins and its people.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/millie-bobby-brown-and-david-harbour-hug-at-stranger-things-season-5-premiere-duffer-bros-react-to-bullying-rumors-1398284">Millie Bobby Brown</a> starrer&nbsp;leans heavily into closure, tying together long-running arcs while escalating the central conflict toward its inevitable end. Instead of relying solely on shock value, the storytelling emphasizes sacrifice, loyalty, and the cost of survival, giving the season a more reflective tone.</p>

<p><strong>What works for Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 2</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest strengths of Volume 2 is its emotional payoff. The show rewards viewers who have stayed invested since Season 1 by revisiting core themes of friendship and found family. Character interactions feel earned, with quieter moments carrying as much weight as the larger confrontations. The pacing, while intense, is more controlled than earlier seasons, allowing tension to build naturally rather than relying on constant spectacle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Visually, Volume 2 continues the series&rsquo; cinematic evolution. The contrast between Hawkins and the Upside Down is sharper, darker, and more symbolic than ever. The writers&rsquo; confidence as storytellers is evident in how they balance horror, nostalgia, and drama without letting one overpower the others. The use of music is also particularly effective, enhancing emotional beats rather than overwhelming them.</p>

<p><strong>What does not work for Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 2</strong></p>

<p>Despite its strengths, Volume 2 is not without flaws. At times, the ambition of tying up so many storylines works against the narrative. A few subplots feel rushed, as though they exist more for resolution than organic storytelling. The character arcs of&nbsp;Mike Wheeler,&nbsp;Will Byers,&nbsp;Max Mayfield,&nbsp;Jonathan Byers could have benefited from more exploration to resolve their internal conflicts.</p>

<p>Additionally, the unresolved conflict occasionally diminishes what once defined <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/will-eddie-munson-return-as-a-vampire-in-stranger-things-season-5-fan-theory-explained-1399432">Stranger Things</a>. While the stakes are undeniably high, some viewers may miss the simplicity of the show&rsquo;s earlier seasons, where smaller mysteries drove the tension. The reliance on exposition in select moments also slightly undercuts the otherwise strong visual storytelling.</p>

<p><strong>Acting performances in Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 2</strong></p>

<p>The performances remain one of the show&rsquo;s strongest pillars. The younger cast, now fully grown into their roles, delivers nuanced and emotionally grounded performances. Each actor brings a sense of maturity that reflects the characters&rsquo; journeys, making their struggles feel authentic rather than melodramatic.</p>

<p>Millie Bobby Brown continues to anchor the series with a restrained yet powerful performance, while Finn Wolfhard and Gaten Matarazzo shine in scenes that emphasize emotional vulnerability over humor. The adult cast also steps up, providing stability and depth, particularly in moments that require moral complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Final verdict of Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 2</strong></p>

<p>Stranger Things Season 5 Volume 2 somewhat disappoints by not maintaining a meaningful continuation. While it may not recapture the raw novelty of its earliest episodes, it compensates with emotional resonance, strong performances, and a clear commitment to honoring its characters&rsquo; journeys. The occasional pacing issues and narrative overload do little to diminish the overall impact.</p>

<p>I feel Volume 2 does not&nbsp;understand&nbsp;what made Stranger Things special in the first place. The Duffer Brothers did not lean into heart over spectacle this time. It remains to be seen whether the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-volume-3-release-date-when-and-where-to-watch-the-epic-series-finale-1399420">Volume 3</a>, set to release on December 31, will deliver a satisfactory conclusion or upset the fanbase.<br />

His other 2025 project, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-junho-kim-min-has-typhoon-family-ott-release-date-time-how-to-watch-online-cast-and-plot-1397531">Typhoon Family</a>, has already received positive feedback, further increasing expectations for Cashero.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what Cashero is about</strong></p>

<p>Cashero follows the story of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/cashero-teaser-lee-junho-locks-december-26-premiere-lee-chae-min-appears-post-bon-appetit-your-majesty-fame-1398833">Kang Sang-ung</a>, an ordinary community center employee whose life changes after he gains superpowers with a strange limitation. His strength depends entirely on how much cash he has. Every time he uses his powers, his money vanishes. This unusual rule turns heroism into a financial risk and adds a relatable layer to the superhero genre.</p>

<p>Sang-ung&rsquo;s girlfriend, Kim Min-suk, played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/lee-dong-wook-to-reunite-with-kim-hye-jun-in-a-shop-for-killers-2-action-thriller-series-set-for-2026-release-1383505">Kim Hye-jun</a>, is a math expert who helps him calculate the cost of each heroic decision. As the story unfolds, Sang-ung discovers a hidden world of people with special abilities.

Fan Theory Explained]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.pinkvilla.com/images/2025-12/1315462333_untitled-design-47.webp"></img><p><strong>Why fans thought Eddie Munson could return&nbsp;as a vampire</strong></p>

<p>The vampire theory gained traction because Eddie was killed by bat-like creatures, and bats are closely associated with vampires in pop culture. Fans also pointed to Kas&#39; lore as a possible twist the <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-release-2025-premiere-of-millie-bobby-brown-starrer-confirmed-by-duffer-brothers-1371381">Duffer Brothers</a> could adapt for the final season.</p>

<p>However, through both parts of Season 5, Eddie does not appear in flashbacks, hallucinations, or the Upside Down. His death is referenced mainly to support Dustin&rsquo;s emotional journey, reinforcing the idea that Eddie&rsquo;s story has already reached its conclusion.</p>

<p>Ross Duffer addressed the theory directly in early December 2025, saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some wild theories, even for season 5. Eddie is not a vampire. I will say that much.&rdquo; The statement was meant to shut down speculation, though it hasn&rsquo;t fully stopped fan discussions.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Season 5 Part 2 does include a vampire reference, but it has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-release-date-confirmed-netflix-reveals-3-volume-plan-for-millie-bobby-brown-finn-wolfhard-starrer-1390247">Eddie Munson</a>. In Episode 5, Kali tells Eleven that Dr. Kay repeatedly took her blood, leading her to think of the doctor as &ldquo;a kind of vampire.&rdquo; The term is used figuratively, not literally.</p>

<p>Dr. Kay was taking Kali&rsquo;s blood to continue Dr. Brenner&rsquo;s experiments, infusing pregnant women in hopes of recreating powers like Eleven&rsquo;s. The show makes it clear that no actual vampires exist in this storyline.</p>

<p>Police stressed that Chase is not wanted for any crimes and has no outstanding warrants. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth noting Tylor is not wanted for any crimes, and police have not spoken with his family,&rdquo; authorities said. Officers also described his behavior during encounters as calm and respectful. &ldquo;In all contacts with him he was polite and cooperative with officers,&rdquo; the department noted.</p>

<p>While some unhoused individuals may respond with anger or hostility, police say Chase&rsquo;s demeanor is different. &ldquo;While some unhoused individuals meet officers with anger or hostility, we&rsquo;re told Tylor is cooperative and always cordial.&rdquo; Officers continue to check on his well-being but emphasize that accepting help remains voluntary unless there is a safety concern.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what police say about the viral videos and public concern</strong></p>

<p>Chase&rsquo;s situation gained wider attention after videos of him appearing disheveled on the streets of Riverside circulated on social media. The clips sparked concern among fans of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/top-20-most-beautiful-hispanic-or-latina-actresses-in-hollywood-find-out-here-1277799">Ned&rsquo;s Declassified School Survival Guide</a>.

<p>The news prompted reactions from former co-stars and fellow child actors. Lindsey Shaw, Devon Werkheiser, and Danielle Curtis Lee expressed concern on a podcast, calling the situation &ldquo;shocking and heartbreaking.&rdquo; Mighty Ducks actor Shaun Weiss, who has spoken publicly about his own struggles and recovery, reportedly offered Chase a bed at a San Clemente recovery facility he works with.</p>

Scientists want to know if artificial beings can develop genuine emotions. Logic already exists in AI. Emotion does not.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s why the simulation matters more than the flood</strong></p>

<p>An-na is taken to a space laboratory, where she learns about the Emotion Engine, a system designed to give AI real emotional depth. Instead of programming emotion, An-na chooses to experience it herself.</p>

<p>She enters a simulation that forces her to relive the flood repeatedly. Each time she fails to save Ja-in, the day resets. At first, she lacks key memories. Over multiple loops, she begins to remember her past, her loss, and her promise to never abandon Ja-in.</p>

<p>The experiment is not about saving the world. It is about proving that love, memory, and sacrifice can exist inside artificial systems.</p>

<p>In the end, An-na remembers everything. She searches differently, resists the guards, and finds Ja-in hiding where he always goes when scared. This completes the test. The simulation ends, and An-na and Ja-in appear together on a spacecraft looking back at Earth.</p>

<p>The film never confirms whether An-na is still human or a recreated being built from her memories. That ambiguity is intentional. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/10-k-drama-and-ott-releases-to-watch-in-december-2025-the-price-of-confession-made-in-korea-and-surely-tomorrow-1398513">The Great Flood</a> suggests that humanity may survive through emotion, even if human bodies do not.</p>

<p>The ending makes one point clear. Survival without emotion is meaningless. Whether An-na escaped the flood or not matters less than what survived with her.</p>

Photos obtained by The Sun show Kravitz with a chunky gold band on her ring finger as she walked arm-in-arm with Styles, fueling engagement rumors around the celebrity couple.</p>

<p>The gold accessory appeared to be the same multi-layered ring paired with a singular band that Kravitz, 37, was seen wearing last month. While neither Kravitz nor Styles, 31, has confirmed anything, the placement of the ring has prompted speculation that their relationship may have reached a new milestone.</p>

<p><strong>Zoe Kravitz and Harry Styles fuel engagement talk in Rome</strong></p>

<p>Despite the rumors, the couple appeared relaxed and affectionate as they explored the Italian capital together. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/zoe-kravitz-recalls-her-wild-stay-at-taylor-swifts-home-amid-la-wildfires-reveals-her-mothers-pet-snake-was-let-loose-1395558">Zoe Kravitz</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-when-harry-styles-said-it-was-flattering-taylor-swift-wrote-songs-about-him-1336895">Harry Styles</a> have been making headlines since confirming their romance in August, after being photographed on several loved-up walks across Europe.</p>

<p>Since then, their whirlwind relationship has taken them to Rome, Tuscany, London, and New York City. The pair have often been spotted wearing coordinated outfits, adding to public interest in their carefully documented &ldquo;promo-style&rdquo; relationship trail.</p>

<p>Friends close to the couple have claimed they are &ldquo;barely apart.&rdquo; According to a source quoted by The Sun, &ldquo;Harry and Zoe have a real connection &mdash; this is love. It&rsquo;s a real honeymoon period and they&rsquo;re barely apart.&rdquo; The source added that Kravitz plans to stay with Styles in the UK while she works on a new film project.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what the gold ring could mean for the couple</strong></p>

<p>While fans continue to speculate about an engagement, sources suggest the relationship is simply growing more serious. &ldquo;Zoe has to get back to work on a film so she&rsquo;s coming to the UK and will be staying with Harry while she&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; the insider said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had an amazing summer together and things are only getting more serious between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Styles is reportedly spending time in Berlin working on his fourth studio album, which could be released in 2027. Another source told The Sun that Zoe joining him there shows &ldquo;how important she is as part of the creative bubble process for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During a recent trip to New York City, Harry Styles met Zoe Kravitz&rsquo;s father, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/lenny-kravitz-holds-concert-midway-to-attend-facetime-call-from-his-friend-denzel-washington-watch-here-1328820">Lenny Kravitz</a>, 61.

The end of the year is seemingly observing the closure for one of the most beloved duos in town, singer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/olivia-rodrigo-louis-partridge-kiss-and-tell-during-wimbledon-date-launch-their-romance-on-instagram-1392880">Olivia Rodrigo and actor Louis Partridge</a>, who are said to have gone their separate ways after 2 years of passionately dating. While they are known to have been together since 2023, the split reportedly happened only a few weeks ago, and not many details are known about it so far. The singer was also spotted talking about it to her friends at Lily Allen&rsquo;s Santa party at strip club Stringfellows in London. The reason for their breakup is not known so far.</p>

<p>While the parties involved are yet to personally comment on the matter, a source close to the situation revealed to The Sun, &ldquo;They made such a lovely couple, so people who know them were shocked when they heard. It&rsquo;s not been the easiest few weeks for them, and they decided it&rsquo;s better to be apart for now.&rdquo; The duo has seemingly decided to take time off from each other, but the songstress remains in despair as she was reportedly spotted venting out to her friends at Lily Allen&rsquo;s recent holiday party on December 21.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olivia was at Lily&rsquo;s party and emotional when she was talking about it. Her friends have rallied around her, but it&rsquo;s just been pretty rough. It&rsquo;s really sad right now,&rdquo; the informer added.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge&rsquo;s relationship timeline</strong></p>

<p>The two were first linked together back in October 2023 when they were spotted celebrating Halloween in London after being introduced via mutual friends. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/pretty-terrifying-olivia-rodrigo-opens-up-about-the-moment-when-she-fell-through-a-hole-while-performing-onstage-1356073">Olivia Rodrigo</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-olivia-rodrigo-engaged-to-louis-partridge-diamond-ring-sighting-in-los-angeles-sparks-buzz-1395499">Louis Partridge</a>&nbsp;made their red carpet debut together at the premiere of his film Disclaimer back in August 2024 at the Venice Film Festival. Initially private, they decided to shower love on each other later on. Their PDA became fans&rsquo; favorite over time as they constantly supported their partner&rsquo;s ventures with all their love. Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge have previously overcome multiple breakup rumors, so fans are hoping this time would be just the same!</p>

Instead, Cruz claims that Brooklyn blocked them first.</p>

<p>On Saturday, December 20, the 20-year-old musician responded to online reports suggesting that David and Victoria unffollowed Brooklyn amid an ongoing family feud. Cruz shut down the claim directly on Instagram Stories. &ldquo;NOT TRUE. My mum and dad would never unfollow their son. Let&rsquo;s get the facts right,&rdquo; he wrote. Cruz then added another claim, saying, &ldquo;They woke up blocked&hellip; as did I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As of December 21, Brooklyn does not appear to be following any of his immediate family members, including his parents or siblings Romeo Beckham, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/cruz-beckham-and-girlfriend-jackie-apostel-pack-on-pda-at-amalfi-coast-all-about-star-couple-with-10-year-age-gap-1395935">Cruz Beckham</a>, and Harper Beckham. The rest of the family also does not follow Brooklyn on Instagram. Brooklyn&rsquo;s wife, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/brooklyn-beckham-and-nicola-peltz-gives-a-peak-into-their-vow-renewal-ceremony-amid-family-feud-with-david-victoria-beckham-1395465">Nicola Peltz Beckham</a>, is also not following David or <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/diet/victoria-beckhams-diet-1348882">Victoria Beckham</a> or Brooklyn&rsquo;s siblings, and none of them appear to follow her either.</p>

<p>Brooklyn has not publicly responded to Cruz&rsquo;s claims. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-and-victoria-beckham-feel-betrayed-amid-brooklyn-fallout-and-growing-family-rift-1389239">David and Victoria Beckham</a> have also not commented directly. However, a spokesperson for Victoria Beckham told PEOPLE that Cruz &ldquo;was responding to stories that [his] parents had unfollowed their son, which isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Cruz Beckham pushes back against false reports</strong></p>

<p>Cruz made it clear that he did not want misleading stories about his family to gain traction. By posting screenshots of media reports, including one from the Daily Mail, Cruz stressed that the narrative online was incorrect. According to him, the family only realized what happened after discovering they had been blocked.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s why fans think the feud goes back years</strong></p>

<p>This is not the first time the Beckham family has faced speculation about internal tensions. In May, an insider told E! News that issues may have surfaced during <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-brooklyn-beckham-tell-his-family-he-wants-no-contact-refuses-to-respond-to-messages-amid-growing-feud-1391189">Brooklyn Beckham</a> and Nicola Peltz Beckham&rsquo;s wedding in April 2022.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brooklyn and Nicola thought that they were going to be given their first dance as a gift by Marc Anthony,&rdquo; the insider said. However, the situation reportedly became awkward when Marc Anthony instead said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it from the most beautiful woman in the room&hellip; Victoria Beckham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the source, &ldquo;Brooklyn was confused as to how he should react and was given a very awkward position.&rdquo; The insider added that Nicola &ldquo;went out of the room bawling&rdquo; but later returned to enjoy the rest of the celebration.</p>

<p>Despite the rumors, Brooklyn recently suggested he is focused on his marriage. In a September 24 interview with the Daily Mail, he said, &ldquo;People will always be there to dump negativity, but I am lucky to have an extremely supportive wife.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;We&nbsp;keep our heads down and stay out of the spotlight. And we are happy.&rdquo;</p>

Having been in and out of many relationships, the singer has often taken to venting out her feelings, and this time, a behind-the-scenes look at what went down during her heavily sold-out Eras Tour is revealing her thoughts about some of the unceremonious moments post her breakups with <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/joe-alwyn-knew-about-ex-girlfriend-taylor-swifts-master-move-to-buy-back-all-music-heres-why-fans-think-so-1390449">Joe Alwyn</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-matty-healy-subtly-throw-shade-at-taylor-swift-during-the-1975s-glastonbury-set-find-out-1392475">Matty Healy</a>, calling them the things that &lsquo;let her down&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Taylor Swift makes brief remarks about Joe Alwyn and Matty Healy breakups&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In the latest episode of Eras Tour: The End of an Era documentary, which was released on December 19, the songstress ends up talking about how men have treated her like a conglomerate and not a person. It has made her question her career, but only with its help has she been able to bounce back. She also made a rare comment about her two relationships, which came to an end in 2023, during the early days of her global tour. In fact, it was the first time she addressed Joe Alwyn and Matty Healy break ups, despite previously penning numerous songs on the The Tortured Poets Department about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were points in this tour where the tour was really the only thing keeping me going in my life,&rdquo; Taylor Swift said in the fourth episode of the docu-series. &ldquo;But there were never points in the tour where I thought, &lsquo;Oh I want to quit the tour because the tour is hard.&rsquo; No, my personal life was hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went on to share how her separation from Joe Alwyn and Matty Healy affected her life. &ldquo;I went through two breakups on the first half of this tour. That&rsquo;s a lot of breakups, actually.&rdquo; However, it was her work and dedication to her craft that got her back. &ldquo;This show is what gave me purpose and what I could use to get me out of bed. The tour has never been the hard thing in my life. The tour has been the thing that allowed me to find purpose outside of the s--t that was going on in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ended it off with a remark many will quote for years to come, &ldquo;Men will let you down, the Eras Tour never will.&rdquo;</p>

The popular model has been in the headlines for her multiple outings with Ben Gorham, a Swedish perfumer whose journey is all the rage. With an 18-year age gap, the two may as well become the next hottest couple in town, and we&rsquo;ll not complain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Ben Gorham</strong></p>

<p>Ben Gorham is a well-known perfumer who has been making waves for his impressive run as an entrepreneur. Born in Sweden, the 48-year-old is half Indian, half Scottish, and French Canadian. According to his statement to The Gloss, he spent his early childhood in Sweden, but was moving around a lot across the world eventually. From a young life in Toronto to high school in New York, followed by a degree in business at Ryerson University in Canada again. After dipping his toes in professional basketball for a while, he found his calling in the perfume business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving to fine arts education in Stockholm, where he really tried out various things, he finally met a perfumer who piqued his interest. Using the skills that he acquired in his very dynamic career, he moved on to manufacturing some interesting scents with little raw materials and an even stricter business landscape available to him. Soon came the launch of Byredo, his baby, which has grown into a famed name in the perfume industry. He would incorporate his childhood memories into sleek visions that caught the attention of many, including his rumored lady love, Kendall Jenner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ben Gorham and Kendall Jenner&#39;s relationship so far</strong></p>

<p>The two were first spotted together back in September of this year. Initially, it was believed that the model would tap into the perfumer business and hence the friendship with Ben Gorham. However, with the recent sighting being their fourth one together already, it seems that more than scents are brewing under the surface for the two. From bookstore dates to lunches and shopping together, they seem to have found a perfect match in each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously, the Jenner lady has been in multiple high-profile relationships, including <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/who-is-molly-murphy-all-about-girl-kendall-jenners-beau-devin-booker-is-allegedly-dating-after-breaking-up-with-her-1385008">Devin Booker</a>, Ben Simmons, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-when-harry-styles-said-it-was-flattering-taylor-swift-wrote-songs-about-him-1336895">Harry Styles</a>, A$AP Rocky, and Bad Bunny.&nbsp;</p>

The singer and actress recently laughed off an awkward question about her appearance, turning it into a teachable and relatable moment on social media.</p>

<p>After sharing an Instagram Story on December 16, the Sunset Blvd singer reacted to a follower who asked her, &ldquo;How do you, like, shave your mustache?&rdquo; Instead of getting offended, Gomez giggled and addressed it head-on. &ldquo;I totally get it,&rdquo; she said while laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually not [a mustache]. It&rsquo;s my melasma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 33-year-old explained that melasma is a skin condition caused by sun exposure. &ldquo;I actually have melasma and a pimple,&rdquo; she added, zooming the camera in on her upper lip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s actually from the sun, so you&rsquo;ll have to obviously wear sunscreen and be careful.&rdquo; According to the Cleveland Clinic, melasma is a common condition that leads to dark patches on areas like the cheeks, forehead, and above the upper lip, often triggered by sunlight and hormonal changes.</p>

<p><strong>Selena Gomez keeps it real about her skin</strong></p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-couldnt-be-more-excited-to-marry-benny-blanco-reveals-when-wedding-planning-will-begin-1395297">Selena Gomez</a> has spoken openly about her appearance. Over the years, she has become increasingly comfortable being herself. In a 2024 interview with Vogue, she said, &ldquo;I have grown so much over the years, and at this point in my life, I am really comfortable in my own skin.&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;Being true to myself means being unafraid of being me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That confidence has also changed her relationship with makeup. In a 2020 essay for CNN, Gomez shared, &ldquo;I used to think I had to wear makeup in order to feel pretty, but now I understand that I don&rsquo;t need makeup to feel beautiful.&rdquo; She described makeup as &ldquo;an accessory&rdquo; and said she launched Rare Beauty in 2019 to &ldquo;challenge the beauty &lsquo;norm&rsquo; and celebrate what makes each of us unique.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gomez has also recently addressed comments about her speaking voice during an Instagram livestream. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten this question a few times, the voice thing,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Sometimes things happen. I get weird. My throat kind of swells inside sometimes. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; She thanked fans for being direct, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad y&rsquo;all are being real with me on the live, I appreciate it, for real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her openness comes during a successful year. Gomez married producer <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/year-ender-2025-13-big-hollywood-weddings-of-the-year-from-selena-gomez-benny-blanco-to-kristen-stewart-and-dylan-meyer-1399249">Benny Blanco</a> in September, released a joint album titled <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-play-who-is-more-likely-to-reveal-who-said-i-love-you-first-1327754">I Said I Love You First</a> that reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200, and earned her fourth consecutive Golden Globe nomination for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/only-murders-in-the-building-season-5-hulu-release-date-cast-plot-and-where-to-watch-1396609">Only Murders in the Building</a>.</p>

<p>The new father was also seen feeding milk to his baby daughter, totally caught up in the moment.

From late-night ice creams to kisses on the forehead, the two seemed to be enjoying the newborn experience to the fullest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in July, PEOPLE reported that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/pete-davidson-reveals-he-feels-very-lucky-on-becoming-dad-amid-girlfriend-elsie-hewitts-pregnancy-1394394">Pete Davidson</a> and Elsie Hewitt were expecting their first child, which they later confirmed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/pete-davidson-and-elsie-hewitt-announce-first-pregnancy-comedian-has-grown-up-after-past-experiences-1393912">sharing pregnancy photos</a> with the world. &quot;Pete and Elsie are doing great, and they&rsquo;re both so excited about becoming parents,&quot; a source shared back then.&nbsp;</p>

Despite moving in together, making a red carpet debut, and completing nearly three years as a couple, the two are deliberately keeping marriage off the table. Sources close to the couple say they are happy, committed, and aligned on their decision to not rush into another marriage.</p>

<p>According to US Weekly, an insider shared that <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/have-brad-pitt-and-ines-de-ramon-begun-living-together-couple-plans-for-future-amid-growing-love-1397629">Brad Pitt</a>, 61, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/is-brad-pitt-planning-on-marrying-ines-de-ramon-source-reveals-how-serious-actor-is-amid-angelina-jolie-divorce-1392471">Ines de Ramon</a>, 34, are &ldquo;still going strong and are very committed.&rdquo; However, when it comes to marriage, the message is clear. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t interested in getting married and are on the same page about that,&rdquo; the source said. Another insider added, &ldquo;No wedding plans at the moment. They are super happy in this phase of their relationship and not rushing into anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why Brad Pitt and Ines de Ramon are taking things slow</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons the couple is avoiding marriage talk is their shared preference for privacy. &ldquo;Ines has no interest in being in the spotlight, and that is what Brad admired about her when they met,&rdquo; the first insider explained. A second source confirmed that they are keeping a low profile on purpose and try to be as normal as possible when they are not working.</p>

<p>Both Pitt and de Ramon have been married before, which has shaped their current outlook. Pitt was previously married to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/jennifer-aniston-confirms-romance-with-jim-curtis-on-instagram-her-sweet-birthday-post-sparks-engagement-buzz-1398165">Jennifer Aniston</a> from 2000 to 2005 and to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/why-is-angelina-jolie-accused-of-haunting-brad-pitt-after-finalizing-years-long-divorce-find-out-f1-the-movie-connection-1391969">Angelina Jolie</a> from 2014 to 2019. He shares six children with Jolie: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne. De Ramon was married to <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/nina-dobrev-reveals-why-she-left-the-vampire-diaries-and-its-not-because-of-ian-somerhalder-breakup-1396663">The Vampire Diaries</a> actor <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/the-vampire-diaries-paul-wesley-proposes-to-gf-natalie-kuckenburg-as-ex-wife-ines-de-ramon-moves-on-with-brad-pitt-1394114">Paul Wesley</a> from 2019 to 2024. These past experiences have led them to take a more measured approach this time.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how Ines de Ramon has changed Brad Pitt&rsquo;s life</strong></p>

<p>Another key factor is Pitt&rsquo;s personal growth after finalizing his long divorce from Jolie in December 2024. One source noted that Pitt has done a lot of work on himself and is now much more at peace. The insider added, &ldquo;Work has been very fulfilling for him, and he has had an amazing year. Ines has brought him a lot of healing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another source echoed this sentiment, saying, &ldquo;Brad is the calmest and healthiest he&rsquo;s been in years. Ines is a great influence on him.&rdquo; Her support has also helped him move forward emotionally. In May 2024, an insider revealed that de Ramon wants Pitt to find peace, forgive and move on.</p>

Carly Rae Jepsen and Cole Marsden Greif-Neill</strong><br />
After announcing her engagement back in September 2024, Carly Rae Jepsen got married to beau Cole Marsden Greif-Neill on October 4 with only 100 guests in attendance. The singer and the music producer had been dating for a while after exchanging vows in the Chelsea Hotel&rsquo;s Bard Room, deciding to keep it strictly intimate.</p>

<p><strong>9. Patrick Schwarzenegger and Abby Champion</strong><br />
The White Lotus star got married to his lady love in a lavish ceremony in early September at the Gozzer Ranch Golf &amp; Lake Club, spanning across 3 days. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, their children, half-kid, and fellow stars like Jason Isaacs were seen at the event. Close to 10 years after they first began dating, and pushing their plans due to The White Lotus Season 3 filming, the two finally began their happily ever after.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10. Chlo&euml; Grace Moretz and Kate Harrison</strong><br />
Years after they were first linked together, Chlo&euml; Grace Moretz and Kate Harrison gave a nice end to the seven-year itch by deciding to get married. The two tied the knot over Labor Day weekend, as confirmed on September 1, and were engaged last year. The actress and the model have been very public about their relationship, flaunting their dating phase online and smothering each other with PDA at every chance they get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>11. Jonathan Majors and Meagan Good</strong><br />
One secret wedding after the other. This update on this couple&rsquo;s nuptials hit the internet on March 18. It is said that their &ldquo;small private wedding&rdquo; was held at their Los Angeles home. The actor later confirmed that it was his mother who officiated the ceremony. The two were first rumored to be dating back in May 2023, and then announced their engagement at the Ebony Power 100 Gala in November 2024.</p>

<p><strong>12. Justin Theroux and Nicole Brydon Bloom</strong><br />
Another low-key couple, the two decided to get married quietly without letting the world know. It was only after photos of the duo dancing on a beach, in what appeared to be a reception setting, surfaced on the internet that it was known that they had tied the knot. He was formerly dating Jennifer Aniston, so the attention for his next partner was at an all-time high already when they were first linked in February 2023. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>13. Elijah Wood and Mette-Marie Kongsved</strong><br />
One more private marriage? Check! The Lord of the Rings star seemingly confirmed that the wedding bells had already rung for the couple after referring to his longtime lover as his &lsquo;wife&rsquo; during an appearance on the Inside of You podcast. Later, it was revealed that they wed during the New Year&rsquo;s time with only about 80 people in attendance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other star couples who exchanged vows this year include Spice Girls star Mel B and beau Rory McPhee, as well as boxer-cum-influencer Logan Paul and Nina Agdal.</p>

<p>Throughout the season, the magical dagger appeared without a clear purpose. In the finale, its role became obvious. The blade was not meant to kill Pennywise. It was meant to contain him. Burying it beneath the Deadwood tree restored the boundary that kept him tied to Derry.</p>

<p>This showed that Pennywise could not be defeated yet. He could only be held back. The ancient structures around Derry acted as a cage for something far older and more powerful than the town itself. Sealing the dagger was not a victory. It was containment.</p>

<p><strong>Dick Hallorann and the true meaning of the ending</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/it-welcome-to-derry-episode-4-when-and-where-to-watch-the-new-episode-on-hbo-max-1398477">Dick Hallorann&rsquo;s</a> role connected Welcome to Derry with The Shining through the concept of the Shine. His ability, once a source of pain and fear, became the only force capable of stopping Pennywise from moving forward. By choosing connection over isolation, Hallorann diverted Pennywise into a mental construct.</p>

<p>Afterward, he left Derry, saying, &ldquo;How much trouble can a hotel be?&rdquo; The line quietly set up his future at the Overlook Hotel. Another key line, &ldquo;no one who dies here ever really dies,&rdquo; summed up the series&rsquo; message. Evil in Derry is not erased. It waits.</p>

<p>The ending reframed Pennywise as something that must be survived, not simply killed. <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/it-welcome-to-derry-season-2-update-strong-ratings-and-creator-plans-hint-at-pennywises-return-1399137">IT: Welcome to Derry</a> closed not with triumph, but with the promise that the fight against fear, division, and denial was far from over.</p>

<p>Earlier, the couple went through a tough time, trying to get over his 2022 infidelity scandal, which was made public via a leaked recording. He then took to his X (formerly Twitter account) to apologize and ask for forgiveness, &ldquo;My baby I was wrong and I&rsquo;m sorry for what I put u through.

<p><strong>About Gil Gerard&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Gil Gerard, born in 1943, was loved by many for his work in Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, which premiered in 1979 and continued through to the next couple of years across two seasons. His other contributions include TV shows, Sidekicks, Nightingales, E.A.R.T.H. Force, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-will-aris-secret-blow-up-tates-friendship-with-holly-1390933">Days of Our Lives</a>.

<p><strong>Gil Gerard&rsquo;s demise announced by wife Janet</strong></p>

<p>In a Facebook post shared by Janet Gerard, the update on his demise was confirmed. &ldquo;Early this morning Gil &ndash; my soulmate &ndash; lost his fight with a rare and viciously aggressive form of cancer,&rdquo; read Janet&rsquo;s post. &ldquo;From the moment when we knew something was wrong to his death this morning was only days.

It&rsquo;s been a great ride, but inevitably one that comes to a close as mine has. Don&rsquo;t waste your time on anything that doesn&rsquo;t thrill you or bring you love. See you out somewhere in the cosmos.&rdquo;</p>

The leaked videos, which were meant to play exclusively alongside James Cameron&rsquo;s Avatar: Fire and Ash, have sparked intense discussion across social media and fan forums.</p>

<p>According to the Express Tribune, Marvel had designed a four-teaser launch strategy, with one teaser set to debut each week starting December 19. The plan was to keep the footage limited to cinemas. However, despite strict anti-piracy warnings, three of the four teaser clips were reportedly recorded by audience members and shared online, forcing the studio to take them down quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Avengers: Doomsday teaser leak puts Marvel&rsquo;s secret marketing plan at risk</strong></p>

<p>The leaked teasers are said to focus on major legacy characters, instantly driving fan interest. The first and most discussed clip reportedly reintroduces <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/chris-evans-reveals-how-he-almost-spilled-proposal-details-to-alba-baptista-before-big-day-let-the-cat-out-of-1390918">Chris Evans</a> as Steve Rogers, hinting at the return of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/reviews/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-and-harrison-ford-hold-their-own-in-a-marvel-movie-that-offers-very-little-fun-and-thrill-1372477">Captain America</a>. While Marvel has not officially confirmed Evans&rsquo; involvement, the teaser allegedly shows Steve riding a motorcycle to the quiet home last seen at the end of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/exclusives/exclusive-video-avengers-endgame-director-we-killed-tom-holland-fired-mark-ruffalo-avoid-spoilers-445232">Avengers: Endgame</a>. Inside, he looks at his old Captain America suit but chooses to pick up his infant son, believed to be James Rogers.</p>

<p>The teaser reportedly ends with the message: &ldquo;Steve Rogers Will Return In Avengers: Doomsday,&rdquo; followed by the film&rsquo;s release countdown.</p>

<p>Evans had earlier denied being part of the next Avengers film. Earlier this year, he said, &ldquo;I talk to [Robert Downey Jr. and the Russos] all the time&hellip; It&rsquo;s sad to not be back with the band, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re doing something incredible.&rdquo; After the leak, fans believe the actor may have downplayed his role to protect the surprise.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what the leaked Avengers: Doomsday teasers reveal</strong></p>

<p>Industry insider Daniel RPK claimed the first teaser confirms Steve Rogers&rsquo; return and positions him as the emotional core of the film. He said, &ldquo;The first teaser is Steve Rogers&ndash;focused and his return is confirmed. The reason is to establish him as the lead character in Avengers: Doomsday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other leaked clips reportedly introduce <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/chris-hemsworth-flaunts-intense-thor-training-for-avengers-doomsday-in-new-workout-video-watch-1385418">Chris Hemsworth&rsquo;s Thor</a> and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/will-robert-downey-jr-s-dr-doom-join-deadpool-wolverines-timeline-for-new-avengers-movie-theory-explored-1334024">Robert Downey Jr.&rsquo;s Doctor Doom</a>, setting up the film&rsquo;s larger conflict.

Readers are advised to proceed with caution</strong></p>

<p>Actor-director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found at their Los Angeles home on Sunday afternoon, as initially reported by TMZ. While the identities of the two bodies discovered were unknown originally, it was later confirmed that the two were indeed the homeowners as police began an investigation into the cause.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rob Reiner and Michele Singer&rsquo;s demise confirmed by family&rsquo;s statement</strong></p>

<p>As rumors continue to circulate about who the people found were, a confirmation was received. &ldquo;It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,&rdquo; read a statement from the couple&rsquo;s family as reported by Variety confirming their deaths.</p>

<p>Later, friend Norman Lear and family, who held Reiner in high regard, shared a note, mourning the passing. &ldquo;The Lear Family is devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner. Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world. Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends. Lyn Lear had remained very close with them and said, &#39;The world is unmistakably darker tonight, and we are left bereft.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>It has been reported that the LA Fire Dept received a medical emergency call on December 14, at about 3:30 PM. A man, 78, and a woman, 68, were discovered dead at the scene, with their identities unconfirmed at that&nbsp;moment. Sources later verified that it was indeed <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/20-best-suspense-movies-as-per-imdb-1191210">Rob Reiner</a> and his wife, Michele. PEOPLE shared that their son Nick is being questioned as the prime suspect for the same, with possible homicide being considered. While there have not been any detentions so far, the authorities are said to be carrying out an investigation at the moment. There are also reports claiming that it was their daughter, Romy, who first found the two bodies in their house.&nbsp;</p>

Variety reported that Episode 7 pulled in 5.8 million viewers in its first three days. Even more importantly, the series is averaging 10.7 million viewers per episode so far. These numbers matter as Warner Bros. Discovery decides whether to renew IT: Welcome to Derry for Season 2.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what the creators have said about future seasons</strong></p>

<p>Although HBO has not confirmed a renewal, Andy Muschietti has already shared plans beyond Season 1. Speaking to Variety in October, he said the story is designed to run much longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our big story arc involves three seasons, mainly based on the three critical cycles of Pennywise, which are 1962, 1935 and 1908,&rdquo; Muschietti said.</p>

<p>He also explained that the series takes inspiration from Stephen King&rsquo;s novel in a unique way. While the IT films adapted the main storyline, the show looks deeper into the book&rsquo;s background sections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Derry explores the deeper lore alluded to throughout the book,&rdquo; Muschietti told Variety. &ldquo;I went into the book and looked at the interludes. I realized there was a hidden story there&hellip; It&rsquo;s a story told backwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With strong ratings, a clear multi-season plan, and <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-brings-pennywise-back-to-haunt-kids-in-sinister-and-creepy-town-watch-1388609">Bill Skarsgard&rsquo;s Pennywise</a> still central to the story, IT: Welcome to Derry Season 2 looks likely, even if it is not official yet. For now, fans can watch the Season 1 finale Sunday night on HBO and HBO Max and wait for an announcement that could bring Pennywise back to Derry once again.</p>

<p>In the Instagram carousel, Ryan offered glimpses into the home birth. One clip showed her sitting in an inflatable birthing pool as Dun comforted her. A Christmas tree glowed in the background, with snow visible through the window. Other photos featured Felix resting on Ryan&rsquo;s chest, bonding with her father, and sleeping peacefully in a crib beside the tree.</p>

<p>Fans and celebrities quickly filled the comments with congratulations. January Jones wrote, &ldquo;Congratulations!!&rdquo; while Twenty One Pilots frontman Tyler Joseph commented, &ldquo;you did it.&rdquo; Jennette McCurdy simply wrote, &ldquo;felix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryan and Dun married on December 31, 2019, a year after getting engaged. Ryan rose to fame on Disney Channel shows Jessie and The Suite Life on Deck. In 2024, she appeared in American Horror Stories and Turtles All the Way Down. She is set to star in Famous alongside Zac Efron and in the sci-fi thriller Orion.</p>

<p>Josh Dun and Twenty One Pilots are also seeing career success. The band recently earned their 13th No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart with City Walls. Their latest album, Breach, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.</p>

The ensemble cast also includes Jonathan Tittel, Toby Wallace, Felix Kammerer, Ignacio Gasparini, and Richard Roxburgh.</p>

<p>Upon release, Eden received mixed reviews. Critics praised its performances, historical setting, and unsettling atmosphere, but raised concerns about pacing, tonal shifts, and an early climax. Still, several reviews highlighted the cast as a major strength.</p>

<p><strong>Why the Netflix release matters for Sydney Sweeney</strong></p>

<p>The Netflix release comes at a crucial time for <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/sydney-sweeney-fortifies-scooter-braun-romance-with-packed-pda-moment-in-nyc-1398250">Sydney Sweeney</a>. Her 2025 slate has been busy but difficult, with Eden, Americana, and the sports biopic Christy all underperforming theatrically. Streaming success could help reverse that trend.</p>

<p>Sweeney also has one final 2025 release, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/did-blake-lively-help-this-ends-with-us-co-star-brandon-sklenar-land-his-role-in-the-housemaid-details-inside-1385516">The Housemaid</a>, hitting theatres on December 19. If Eden performs well on Netflix, it could help her end the year on a stronger note while giving Ron Howard&rsquo;s underrated thriller the audience it initially missed.</p>

The actress and comedian, 44, confirmed the news of their divorce in an Instagram post shared on Friday, December 12. In her statement, Schumer emphasized that the split is amicable and that the former couple remains focused on co-parenting their six-year-old son, Gene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blah blah blah Chris and I have made the difficult decision to end our marriage after 7 years. We love each other very much and will continue to focus on raising our son. We would appreciate people respecting our privacy at this time,&rdquo; <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/throwback-to-when-amy-schumer-brutally-mocked-blake-livelys-interview-persona-as-actress-faces-legal-battle-against-justin-baldoni-1366769">Amy Schumer</a> wrote, alongside a photo of the pair standing together on a subway platform. The candid tone of the message reflected Schumer&rsquo;s signature humor while underscoring the mutual respect between the two as they move forward separately.</p>

<p>Schumer and Fischer&rsquo;s relationship began in late 2017, and their romance progressed quickly.

Speaking on Today shortly after their wedding, Schumer explained the rapid pace of their relationship, saying the two had been friends for about six months before getting married. &ldquo;We got down to business really quick,&rdquo; she joked at the time.</p>

<p>The divorce announcement comes weeks after <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/5-times-hollywood-actors-turned-down-iconic-roles-and-how-those-films-performed-at-the-box-office-1375972">Schumer</a> wiped her Instagram grid, deleting previous posts before returning with a new set of photos on November 11. Around the same time, she addressed speculation from media outlets suggesting the deletions were linked to weight loss. Schumer pushed back against the narrative, writing that it was &ldquo;something you created,&rdquo; and adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of how I&rsquo;ve looked always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Schumer and Fischer begin this next chapter, both appear committed to maintaining a positive relationship centered on their son and family.</p>

A hidden family fortune also plays a major role, a rare jewel swallowed by Jefferson&rsquo;s grandfather, Reverend Prentice Wicks.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what&nbsp;happens</strong></p>

<p>Wicks&rsquo; flask contains a paralytic, but the fatal blow is delivered by dentist Nat Sharp, who pulls out a fake knife and stabs Wicks for real. Later, when the monsignor appears to &ldquo;rise from the dead,&rdquo; it is actually Samson Holt in disguise. Nat kills Samson, hoping to secure the jewel for himself.</p>

<p>Martha Delacroix, Wicks&rsquo; devoted aide, uncovers Nat&rsquo;s intentions. She switches their coffee cups, causing Nat to poison himself. She then stages the scene to make it appear as though Jefferson drowned Nat in acid. Martha confesses everything to Jud, with Blanc listening. She also admits to poisoning herself to protect the jewel from greedy hands.</p>

<p>By the end, the investigation shows how Wicks manipulated his congregation for years. Each member battles personal guilt, resentment, or hidden truths, including Vera Draven learning that Cy is Wicks&rsquo; illegitimate son.</p>

<p>Martha dies with the jewel in her hand. Jud decides to protect it from further chaos. He renames the church Our Lady of Perpetual Grace, in memory of Jefferson&rsquo;s mother, Grace Wicks. He hides the jewel inside a wooden figure of Jesus above the altar, hoping for a peaceful future for the parish.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what happens in the final episode</strong></p>

<p>The tension builds when Petra informs Bingley that the penthouse owners have changed their plans and will be arriving for Christmas. The appointed housekeeper is unable to come because of heavy snowfall, leaving Bingley to prepare everything alone.

Speaking on Jay Shetty&rsquo;s On Purpose podcast, the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch explained that her bond with her kids&rsquo; exes comes from a place of love, compassion, and long-term family values.</p>

<p>Jenner said, &ldquo;First of all, I believe in my heart and in my soul, love is love. And I fall in love with people. These are, in most cases, the fathers of my grandchildren. And I love these men. And that love doesn&#39;t go away when we experience really challenging times with them. It just doesn&#39;t turn off like that for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Kris Jenner says her kids&rsquo; exes always have &#39;an open door&#39;</strong></p>

<p>During the conversation, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/ive-gotta-have-my-ovaries-taken-out-kris-jenner-to-undergo-surgery-after-ovarian-tumor-discovery-1324384">Kris Jenner</a> shared that she continues treating her children&rsquo;s ex-partners like family because she wants to promote stability and kindness for her grandchildren. She said every one of them knows they can still reach out. &ldquo;They have an open door,&rdquo; she explained, adding that her approach is based on &ldquo;communication, compassion, forgiveness, and moving through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Jenner, the relationship she has with her kids&rsquo; exes goes beyond past romantic ties. She said she often thinks about the future and how her choices will reflect on her grandchildren. &ldquo;What will my grandkids think 20 years from now if their grandmother treated their dad poorly?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Jenner added that she encourages her own children to forgive and move forward in life, so she practices the same with their former partners. &ldquo;Forgive somebody who&rsquo;s treated you badly and move on,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s why family still comes first for Kris Jenner at 70</strong></p>

<p>Jenner recently celebrated her 70th birthday in a star-studded James Bond-themed party at <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/pics-jeff-bezos-lauren-sanchez-step-out-for-lavish-reception-kiss-publicly-for-first-time-since-wedding-1392493">Jeff Bezos&rsquo;s</a> mansion. Turning 70 has only strengthened her desire to focus on family, work, and her health. She told E! News on November 15 that retirement isn&rsquo;t on her mind yet, saying her mother worked until she was 82. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really what kept her young&hellip; I hope to be exactly the same and I hope to be healthy,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She added that her life now centers on her family, grandchildren, kids, and relationships, noting that these connections &ldquo;mean so much&rdquo; to her.</p>

<p>Jenner also recently celebrated longtime boyfriend<a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/kris-jenner-and-corey-gamble-spark-breakup-rumors-after-tense-moment-at-beyonces-vegas-concert-1394694"> Corey Gamble&rsquo;s</a> 45th birthday with a heartfelt Instagram tribute on November 10, calling him her &ldquo;rock,&rdquo; &ldquo;ride or die,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the most incredible partner.&rdquo; The couple has been together since meeting in 2014. She has even said on The Kardashians that she would &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; marry Gamble when she turned 70.</p>

<p>Titled &ldquo;Winter Fire,&rdquo; the episode closes the first season of the horror prequel. Like previous episodes, it continues to uncover Derry&rsquo;s disturbing past while exploring the early 1960s setting that shapes the origins of Pennywise. The series opened with the disappearance of a young boy, setting off fear, secrets and rising tension across Derry. As the season ends, viewers hope the finale addresses the lingering mysteries linked to the town&rsquo;s tragedies.</p>

<p>The show has also featured appearances from <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-brings-pennywise-back-to-haunt-kids-in-sinister-and-creepy-town-watch-1388609">Bill Skarsgard&rsquo;s Pennywise</a>. Fans are now wondering if the season will end with another encounter. Notably, the series uses Pennywise sparingly, similar to how Monarch: Legacy of Monsters handled Godzilla, building anticipation with every appearance.</p>

<p>Many viewers are curious about what lies ahead for characters Ingrid and Hank, and whether the deaths of the kids in the first episode will finally lead to justice. With stakes rising after the previous episode, fans expect the finale to give clear answers, or at least set the stage for future chapters.</p>

<p><strong>Is It: Welcome to Derry Season 2 happening?</strong></p>

<p>The show hasn&rsquo;t been officially renewed yet, but the creators have shared that it was designed as a multi-season prequel trilogy. They plan to explore different timelines in Derry&rsquo;s dark history, with Season 2 expected to focus on events from 1935 if confirmed. With strong audience reception and viral weekly moments, a renewal feels increasingly likely.</p>

<p>First spotted backstage at Miley&#39;s 2021 New Year&#39;s Eve Party in Miami, they later confirmed their romance with steamy kisses in West Hollywood in 2022. After being pushed on a blind date, the two seemingly hit it off very well and have been romantically involved since.

<p>While Miley Cyrus and Maxx Morando have not yet opened up about their relationship or confirmed their engagement, it appears that they are ready to move on to the next stage. The couple appeared affectionate while posing on the red carpet. Both decided to dress in black, with Maxx opting for a tuxedo over a white dress shirt and Miley going for a sparkly, heart-neckline dress with mermaid ruffle trail. His hair appeared ruffled and loosely set while hers was pulled back in an undemanding way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 27-year-old kept his look mostly plain and with no sign of accessories, but the Hannah Montana star went all out with hers. A singular diamond necklace, double hoop earrings, and a beautiful stack of rings adorned her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two were first rumored to be dating back in 2021 and have since been spotted together on multiple occasions, even moving in together last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Episode 6, In the Name of the Father, left viewers on one of the biggest twists of the season.

This moment sets up an intense continuation for Episode 7.</p>

<p>While the season is officially scheduled for eight episodes, Episode 7 stands out not only because of its long runtime but also because of its expected focus on the Black Spot storyline. Fans online are speculating about major plot reveals, deeper character exploration and more insight into the curse that has haunted Derry for generations.</p>

<p>For international audiences, Episode 7 will be available through standard streaming platforms, and the chapter is expected to run around 58 minutes for broadcast, with extended content available on streaming.</p>

The combination of military action, jungle warfare, and prehistoric predators sets Primitive War apart from typical war films. Viewers can expect tense encounters, survival challenges, and a storyline that focuses on how the squad handles threats beyond human enemies.</p>

<p>The themes of fear, survival, and teamwork remain central as the soldiers navigate dangerous terrain filled with deadly creatures. The film uses practical and digital effects to bring these dinosaurs to life, which may attract fans of both war dramas and monster movies.</p>

<p>The cast includes Ryan Kwanten, known for his roles in action and thriller films, along with Tricia Helfer, Nick Wechsler, and Jeremy Piven. Their performances contribute to the film&rsquo;s grounded tone, balancing action sequences with character-driven moments.</p>

<p>Stranger Things Season 5 picks up in fall 1987, right after the catastrophic events of Season 4. The town of Hawkins is still reeling as it is scarred by the opening of the &ldquo;Rifts,&rdquo; and under pressure from the government forces. The core group, led by Eleven, portrayed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/millie-bobby-brown-fires-back-at-comments-saying-she-looks-40-explains-you-did-meet-me-when-i-was-10-1377179">Millie Bobby Brown</a>, Will Byers played by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/david-harbor-shares-major-update-about-stranger-things-season-5-reveals-this-episode-is-the-best-theyve-ever-done-1354075">Noah Schnapp</a>, Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson played by Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair, and Max Mayfield portrayed by <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/sadie-sink-to-join-avengers-doomsday-after-stranger-things-and-spiderman-brand-new-day-gigs-report-1398537">Sadie Sink</a>, has the most intimidating mission, which is to find and kill Vecna.</p>

<p>However, Vecna has vanished, and his plans remain unknown. Meanwhile, Hawkins is under a military quarantine, and the authorities intensify their search for Eleven, forcing her into hiding. The rising tension, uncertainty, and looming threat set the stage for a darker, more urgent fight than anything the group has faced before.</p>

<p><em><strong>Disclaimer: This article contains spoilers</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>What works for Stranger Things 5</strong></p>

<p>The government-led military lockdown, horror elements, and growing paranoia give the season a noticeably darker atmosphere. What works best for the series this time around are the broken friendships and the weight of the lives lost, both of which add real depth and emotional maturity to the characters. These relationships, which are strained, fractured, and in some cases irrevocably changed, create a sense of vulnerability that feels more intense than in previous seasons.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Rifts&rdquo; between Hawkins and the Upside Down are there to set the stage for the merging of worlds, which possibly hints at a larger transformation or resolution in the upcoming episodes. The first four episodes continue to embrace the strong 1980s roots, with the spotlight on the original friend group, while maintaining the supernatural tone that has always defined the heart of Stranger Things.</p>

<p><strong>What does not work for Stranger Things 5</strong></p>

<p>That said, you will also come across several loose ends in the first four episodes. The suspense surrounding the fate of Eleven and her friends, along with the uncertainty of Vecna&rsquo;s survival, at times makes the storyline feel hurried and overwhelming. Certain characters&rsquo; arcs get lost in the chaos of the heavy, layered narrative, and this deep complexity occasionally stalls the overall intensity.</p>

<p>As Season 5 is being released in three parts, with Volume 1 on November 26, Volume 2 on December 25, and the finale on December 31, there is a high chance that momentum might suffer. A major cliffhanger followed by long waits has the potential to dilute the impact, disrupt the flow, and lessen the urgency of the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Acting performances in Stranger Things 5</strong></p>

<p>The actors, right from the original members to the supporting cast, try their best to carry the emotional weight of the series. The trauma, loss, and fear are commendable. The group dynamics feel lived-in with the weariness of growing up, the heaviness of responsibility, and the lingering guilt from the past. This gives their performances more gravity than the early seasons&rsquo; kids-being-kids vibe.</p>

<p>Millie Bobby Brown played her role of Eleven with the same quiet strength that she has shown since Season 1 to now. Her acting has matured with the same intensity as her journey through the various seasons. Her journey goes beyond power as Eleven is leaning toward acceptance, a willingness to confront her own fears, and an understanding of the sacrifices when she goes into hiding. Apart from fighting to defeat a monster, she&rsquo;s also trying to protect the people who shaped her.</p>

<p>Side characters and returning favorites benefit from the high stakes as their friendships feel more fragile yet deeper. While the relationships seem to get more complicated, the moral dilemmas become more real. The fear, doubt, loyalty, and love are reflected in the most admirable manner through their performances.</p>

<p><strong>Final verdict of Stranger Things 5</strong></p>

<p>The first four episodes of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/stranger-things-season-5-volume-1-india-release-date-streaming-time-runtimes-and-episode-titles-revealed-1398720">Stranger Things Season 5</a> deliver a compelling, moody, and emotionally charged start to what promises to be the show&rsquo;s final and biggest chapter. By combining high stakes, personal trauma, mythological weight, and matured character dynamics, the season sets a tone that feels worthy of a finale.</p>

<p>Yes, there are risks! The pressure to wrap up a sprawling story behind the fate of Hawkins and the Upside Down is huge. The split release format might hamper the intensity. And with so many threads, there is always the danger of a rushed ending. But for now, Stranger Things 5 seems to be moving toward a meaningful end.</p>

<p>If the creators manage to balance horror, nostalgia, emotions, and characters, Season 5 has the potential to be a gratifying, powerful, and bittersweet farewell to a show that has had a cross-generational cultural impact.</p>

French actor Eva Green, known for films like Miss Peregrine&rsquo;s Home For Peculiar Children and Dark Shadows, is joining Wednesday Season 3 as Aunt Ophelia, the long-missing sister of Morticia Addams.</p>

<p>This marks Green&rsquo;s return to a <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/monica-bellucci-and-tim-burton-relationship-timeline-1st-meeting-at-cannes-film-festival-to-breakup-after-2-years-1397051">Tim Burton</a>&ndash;led project and adds a fresh twist to the Addams Family story. Show creators Al Gough and Miles Millar told Tudum that &ldquo;Eva Green has always brought an exhilarating, singular presence to the screen &mdash; elegant, haunting, and beautifully unpredictable. Those qualities make her the perfect choice for Aunt Ophelia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Green also shared her excitement, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled to join the woefully twisted world of <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/wednesday-season-2-episode-release-dates-timings-and-where-to-watch-online-1395171">Wednesday</a> as Aunt Ophelia. This show is such a deliciously dark and witty world, I can&rsquo;t wait to bring my own touch of cuckoo-ness to the Addams family.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>A major addition to Wednesday Season 3</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/wednesday-season-2-finale-explained-ophelias-return-enids-alpha-twist-and-whats-next-in-season-3-1396426">Aunt Ophelia </a>was mentioned throughout Season 2 but never fully revealed. Viewers only saw her briefly in the final episode, from behind, wearing a flower crown and writing &ldquo;Wednesday must die&rdquo; on a wall. In the story, Morticia describes her sister as missing after losing control of her powers as a Raven. This connects to Wednesday&rsquo;s own struggle with her psychic abilities, which caused black tears in Season 2.</p>

<p>The Season 2 finale ended with Morticia handing Wednesday Ophelia&rsquo;s old journal, triggering a vision of Ophelia locked in a dark room inside Grandmama Hester&rsquo;s mansion. Millar explained that Ophelia&rsquo;s disappearance has &ldquo;left a hole in Morticia&rsquo;s life and a lot of unanswered questions,&rdquo; adding that her return &ldquo;is going to hit this family like a bomb.&rdquo; Gough said it was always planned to introduce her in a surprising way that leads directly into Season 3.</p>

<p>With Eva Green stepping into the role, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/netflix-renews-wednesday-for-season-3-is-jenna-ortega-starrer-eyeing-a-spin-off-1394404">Wednesday Season 3</a> is expected to explore the mystery surrounding Ophelia&rsquo;s disappearance and her impact on the Addams family.

While previously, only murmurs about its production and possible crossover with the original version were heard, it seems that the idea is set in stone and will take flight in the coming year. According to a Collider report, the project will go on floors in the coming year and will involve famed director David Fincher alongside the original creator of the series, <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hwang-dong-hyuks-involvement-in-squid-game-usa-remake-groundless-creator-reveals-if-hed-answer-david-finchers-invite-1392549">Hwang Dong Hyuk</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Squid Game: America to break a leg next year, here&rsquo;s all we know</strong></p>

<p>Quoting the details on the Film &amp; Television Industry Alliance (FTIA) website, Squid Game: America will begin filming on February 26, 2026. Among the possible locations, Los Angeles and California have been named the biggest spots for filming. Director David Fincher will helm the project as the lead director with original creator Hwang Dong Hyuk and Kim Ji Yeon, CEO of Pertsman Studio, joining hands with him as producers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Squid Game: America has not confirmed the nitty gritties of the project; however, it has been said that it will be set in the same universe as the original Squid Game. An official spin-off, it will not remake the storyline but instead run parallel to the Korean counterpart. It will showcase the cultural changes and the implementation of American take on the games. Previously, actress <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/why-fans-believe-cate-blanchett-will-lead-the-american-squid-game-1392457">Cate Blanchett</a> made a cameo in <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/squid-game-3-lee-jung-jae-starrer-ranks-no-1-in-93-countries-among-netflix-series-becomes-fastest-k-drama-to-achieve-feat-1392561">Squid Game season 3</a>, right after the end of the games, hinting at her takeover of the role originally played by Gong Yoo, the salesperson. She will reportedly join the western version as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While no confirmation has been made from the director or the creator&rsquo;s side about the adaptation, the details on the website appear to be more or less the same. It was also reported that, in line with the filming schedule, the release of the project might appear to be around 2028, during Christmas time, much like the previous two seasons of Squid Game. No further seasons for the Korean version are planned as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chadwick Boseman, the late actor best known for his iconic role as Black Panther, was posthumously awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The emotional ceremony, held on November 20, saw his wife, Simone Ledward-Boseman, place a pair of his shoes on the star, symbolically allowing him to &ldquo;step&rdquo; onto the memorial. The event was attended by family, friends, and co-stars from his most famous films.</p>

<p>Simone, who married Chadwick privately months before his death, also brought a framed picture of the actor to the ceremony. She shared the moment with his brothers, Derrick and Kevin Boseman, honoring Chadwick&rsquo;s legacy and the life he lived. &quot;Chad was more than an actor or even an artist,&quot; she said as reported by E! News. &quot;He was a spiritual teacher fortified by family; close friends that kept him grounded in faith; a team that believed in him, protected him and fought for him; colleagues that trusted his vision, that lifted him up and forged a real brotherhood.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>How Chadwick Boseman inspired generations</strong></p>

<p>The ceremony was attended by key figures from Chadwick&rsquo;s career, including his Black Panther co-stars <a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/box-office/box-office-michael-b-jordans-sinners-is-hollywoods-theatrical-hope-but-tracks-below-creed-iii-marking-a-downgrade-for-the-actor-1379481">Michael B.

Coogler recalled Chadwick as incredibly generous and said that even when he knew his days were limited, he continued to give to his craft and fully committed himself to his work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/happy-birthday-viola-davis-exploring-her-top-10-roles-as-actress-turns-59-1337860">Viola Davis</a>, who starred alongside Chadwick in Ma Rainey&rsquo;s Black Bottom, said that his work reminded people that they are less alone and described him as more than just an actor delivering wonderful performances on screen.</p>

Despite battling colon cancer privately for four years, he continued to act, performing his own stunts and fully committing to his roles, Coogler noted.</p>

<p>During the ceremony, Simone reflected on Chadwick&rsquo;s impact. &quot;Chad taught all of us a great deal. His heart was so vast he could give each and every person a specific part of him and still have so much left to share with the world,&quot; she said. She continued, addressing Chadwick directly: &quot;We recognize your skill and your devotion, and we submit your legacy as a hero and an icon. You lived with honor and you walked in truth. You are as brilliant as you were beautiful and as courageous as you were kind. We love you. We miss you. We thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>Disney CEO Bob Iger was also present at the ceremony, along with Chadwick&rsquo;s family and friends, marking a moment to celebrate the late actor&rsquo;s career and lasting influence in Hollywood.</p>

However, Chase&rsquo;s recent Instagram posts suggest the relationship, romantic or otherwise, may be definitively over.</p>

<p><strong>A look back at their relationship</strong></p>

Kelsea recalled to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show in January, &ldquo;It was like a 5 a.m.&rsquo;er, ungodly hour&hellip; I heard him be so lovely to her, and give her so much time and attention, and intention.
